                                England coach Stuart Lancaster was forced to ring the changes in a weakened team named Thursday to face the All Blacks at Auckland's Eden Park on Saturday. With a slew of first-choice players unavailable because they were involved in last week's Premiership decider, Lancaster made eight changes to the starting 15 that turned out for England's last fixture against Italy in the Six Nations. Lock Geoff Parling and flanker James <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Haskell">Haskell</a></span>, neither of whom have played for England in more than 12 months, were recalled, along with powerhouse centre Manu Tuilagi, who was relegated to the reserves for the Italy game.

                                Cloud computing is producing a huge crop of big and successful companies. There are already 23 public cloud companies trading at more than $1 billion in market cap, tracked by Bessemer Venture Partners' BVP Cloud Index. Bessemer has also identified another 300 successful cloud startups; among them, 16 have already hit a $1 billion valuation or on the verge of it, a concept BVP calls the "cloud unicorn." The unicorn indicates the mythical nature of crossing that $1 billion valuation milestone. BVD predicts many of these companies could hit the $1 billion valuation through an acquisition. The companies are: 1. AppDynamics: makes "application performance monitoring" software that helps developers find and fix problems. 2. Atlassian: makes software for collaborating on software development and other projects and is already valued at $3.3 billion, after it raised $150 million from T. Rowe Price in April. 3. Box: offers enterprise and consumer cloud storage. Box filed for a much-publicized IPO, but it hasn't priced shares or shared a valuation. 4. Cloudera: offers commercial support for a popular free and open source <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> technology called Hadoop. 5. DocuSign: lets businesses securely sign, send and management electronic documents. 6. Domo: offers what's known as a "business intelligence" app that lets companies capture data in spreadsheets and other documents and use that data to create charts, graphs, reports. 7. Dropbox: offers consumer and business cloud storage. 8. Evernote: offers a note-taking app that is popular with enterprises and consumers. 9. HubSpot: offers marketing software. 10. Mobile Iron: offers mobile device security software used by enterprises. Filed for a $128 million IPO in April. 11. MuleSoft: offers a cloud service that connects clouds together so they can share data. 12. New Relic: offers an application performance monitoring service. 13. Shopify: offers e-commerce website hosting. 14. Stripe: turns a tablet or smartphone into a credit card payment machine. 15. SurveyMonkey: offers an online survey tool. 16. Twilio: offers software that lets companies add support for phone calls and text messages in their apps and  websites.

                                We recently declared that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> debate was over. Despite clear evidence of the shale boom's local environmental effects, it's probably added about 50 basis points to GDP, shrunk the trade deficit, and created tens of thousands of jobs. Despite all that, Goldman Sachs believes America has left tons of figurative barrels and cubic feet on the table by not more aggressively investing in spurring demand. While the U.S. share of global upstream (that is, production) investment outpaced funds into Saudi Arabia and Russia by 10:1, the rest of the world outspent the U.S. on demand-side investment — places to put all those resources — by 15:1. "...Far less attention has been paid to the economic opportunities North America has failed to harness from the revolution," Goldman's Steve Strongin, Jeff Currie and Daniel Quigley warn. "Instead, the United States seems more on track to export shale, as the United States has lagged other countries in generating the demand – and the high-value manufacturing jobs that come along with this demand – needed to consume <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span>. In this respect, we believe that the shale revolution may stall and not see the full longevity of the “demand response” phase." What we are experiencing, the Goldman team says, is a failure of ambition and foresight on the both public and private sides of the energy policy equation. "To successfully develop domestic gas demand over the longer term, business and government leaders need to work together to solidify the confidence that is required to attract capital over the next 30 years," they write. How big could the missed opportunity get? Goldman projects up to 2 million new jobs could be created over the next decade, 1.0% of additional GDP, and at least a 5% incremental reduction on greenhouse gas emissions. Goldman sees three main areas where demand for shale resources could be expanded. First, manufacturing. Despite what you may have heard about a manufacturing renaissance, Goldman says that on a comparative basis the U.S. has massively underspent to transition its manufacturing base toward its newfound shale stocks.  Even though natural gas prices in the United States are 60% to 75% lower than in Asia and Europe, energy-intensive manufacturing has failed to rise significantly or to create much- needed jobs. Since the onset of the shale revolution in late 2010, key energy-intensive manufacturing sectors such as chemicals and petroleum products have underperformed the broader economy by 2.2% p.a. and have generated only 5,000 new jobs, compared to 40,000 jobs if these industries had grown in line with US manufacturing more generally. You may recall Jan Hatzius made this same argument a year ago. Apparently little has changed. Here's the chart comparing to output of products that would use shale resource-based inputs:    Next up is transportation. Goldman says that spending up to $5.1 trillion to boost gas-based capacity in our vehicle fleet would allow us to reduce our energy bills by as much as 10% by 2035. Consumers would see the most immediate return on natural gas-based ethanol, for which, as it stands, there is almost no refining capacity in the U.S. Plus, the renewable fuels standard makes no exception for this kind of ethanol, further impeding its adoption. While the cost of doubling down on gas-based ethanol could run as high as $3.7 trillion, "[j]ust because something costs a lot does not mean it’s not worth doing," Goldman argues.  There is another scenario whereby the U.S. doubles down on electric vehicles. This would cause electricity demand to surge, which in turn would stimulate demand for more natural gas power plants. Even a gradual shift would accomplish this: Based on our supply/demand analysis of the US power market, we believe the new capacity our base case forecast includes could meet gradual increases in electric vehicle demand for power, but could add 8-10 Bcf/d in natural gas demand from the US power sector. We also assume that this incremental natural gas generation would lead (relative to our base case) to a minor increase in CO2 emissions from the power sector, albeit an increase of only 5%-10%. Finally, there's the power and environment case: If we switched out all unscrubbed coal plants with natgas plants (a scenario not likely to be fully realized, but a version of which is not out of the question) natural gas-fired power generation would grow by 22 Bcf/d over the next 25 years, to 40% from 23% of the overall power mix. Goldman:  Natural gas plays two important roles in a successful environmental power strategy. First, it provides the bridge away from coal toward cleaner renewables – gas is more able to respond in the short term to coal retirements (for example, by increasing utilization at current facilities). But second, it is an important complement to renewables, able to respond at short notice to the intermittency of renewables generation. We're already begun to feel the effects of our lack of investment. While there was ample natural gas around to get us through the grueling winter, electricity prices spiked anyway because the gas could not be delivered to where it needed to go. While much of the country enjoyed the standard price of $4/mmBtu, prices in large metro regions in the Northeast soared to above $120/mmBtu because of that lack of adequate infrastructure. Policy and market design adjustments throughout the Northeast appear necessary to enable more potential gas/power customers — whether those of regulated utilities, merchant power companies or large commercial/industrial companies – to enter multi-year gas/power contracts that could then stimulate more gas infrastructure development. Alternatively, clarity to producers that pipeline expansions will be approved over an acceptable investable time horizon are likely be needed for producers to fund new pipelines. Both of these outcomes could lead to additional supplies of gas flowing to New England markets and accommodate greater residential/commercial use of natural gas, reducing the use of fuel oil. So where do we wind up if the status quo persists? Goldman says we appear shockingly willing to allow exports to carry American resources outside our shores, and all because we can't be bothered to put in the effort to allow it to be consumed here. This will provide some growth, but far less than what could be accomplished. A clear commitment to keeping the export ban in place would stimulate downstream refinery capex investment to catch up to the upstream investment, helping to absorb growing domestic light crude production. On the other hand, if the export ban was lifted, US crude oil production would realize its strongest growth potential. However, with domestic prices converging back to seaborne crude oil prices, the margin advantage of domestic refiners would diminish and limit capex growth in the downstream sector. While export volumes would increase, the United States would be exporting the “value added” of processing its shale oil along with these barrels. A strong indictment. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: How Solar Will Destroy America, In 5 Easy Steps Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                You haven't used 'stakeholder' enough. Professor and student via Tyler Olson/Shutterstock Thankfully, nobody speaks academic English as a first language. The English of the university is a very particular form that has specific features and conventions. Sometimes, this is just referred to as “academic style”. It used to be a matter of instinct – what felt right. But now a large amount of research is using a “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” approach to analyse millions of words of academic writing. This has resulted in projects such as the Academic Word List, the 570 most commonly used words in academic text across disciplines, (excluding the 2,000 most common words in English). Other research has looked at what words and phrases are often used to thread the various parts of a structure together. These are known as “lexical bundles”, and reflect the view that a language doesn’t have a separate grammar and vocabulary – rather the two are combined into a “lexico-grammar”. Every university which teaches in English will have an English language teaching department to support students whose first language is not English. These departments vary in size and prominence, but what they all share is that they purport to teach “English for academic purposes”. What’s acceptable? There is a tension within the field about what type of English should be acceptable. It is recognised that English is no longer solely the language of the British, North Americans and Australasians. English is spoken as a first or second language in countries such as Kenya and Malaysia, and is being learnt as a lingua franca by vast numbers of people across the world, from Argentina to China. This has led to a re-conceptualisation of English as a language without a centre, and with a much greater flexibility in terms of grammatical accuracy than a single standard. This makes enormous sense when a Pole is talking to a Vietnamese person in a social setting: the niceties of grammar do not matter, the message does. However, academic writing is generally done under high-stakes conditions, on which students’ degree are judged. This leads to a tension between encouraging students to write with clarity, with accuracy or with fluency. If we tell our students “the message, not the grammar, matters” and the person marking their dissertations insists that the correct form is “the data suggest” not “the data suggests”, we are doing them a disservice. This idea of a grammatical normality becomes even more complex when we bring in students who are using English as a second language, but often in highly localised forms. For example, a Malaysian student whose English is perfectly functional, but includes very few auxiliary verbs such as “does” and “am”, may come to a course on English for academic purposes, to be told that the form of English he speaks, and has spoken since childhood is “wrong”. Some see this as the equivalent of an American studying in Britain being told she must stop using words such as “candy” and “mailman” – surely an intolerable intrusion into her linguistic identity. Or, should we teach students that they must, at least in the academic context, speak and write within the grammatical norms of the UK? This seems like an unacceptably colonial attitude. The solution most practitioners and writers come up with is to allow the students the choice. To do this, they need to allow them to see and analyse the norms of academic writing. By doing this, the control of what is acceptable moves from the teacher to the students, allowing them a much larger amount of autonomy in their writing. This also encourages students to think of themselves as member of the academic community, with their own academic self, and academic voice. This is reflected in the shift in title from “teacher” or “tutor” to “language adviser”, seen in many English for academic purposes departments. The coming of Google translate Another issue facing the sector is the issue of free online automatic translations, such as Google translate. It could be argued that these could put the English for academic purposes departments out of business: why would a student go to the expense and effort of learning English when he or she can just translate in and out of his first language online? But this argument relies on the assumption that academic English relies on a surface level of literacy, based purely on grammatical accuracy. What Google translate is unable to do is teach the deeper academic literacies needed by students for full engagement with the academic community. It is my prediction that machine translation will inevitably change the way students are taught English – but it will not replace it. Alongside these debates, it’s important to remember that this type of English teaching is all about language being used to express complex ideas, and it is impossible to teach without a certain complexity and depth of content. It is also about aligning to the intellectual norms of academia, which generally involves a large amount of analysis and picking apart of concepts within a rigorous intellectual framework. We show respect to the intellectuals by trying to deconstruct their work. However, many students will come to an English for academic writing course from a radically different intellectual background, one where school, or even university has been more focused on understanding and reworking the ideas of the established experts, and respecting their work by not trying to deconstruct it. Therefore, the job of the English for academic purposes teacher gains an extra layer. They need to encourage a different type of thinking in the students, in order to enable them to take part in a different type of writing.

                                Who goes there? Who goes under there?Djuradj Vujcic, CC BY-SA Not In My Back Yard, or NIMBY-ism as it is known, is one thing, but the prospect of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> in rock deep underground has thrown up a new type of protest: Not Under My Back Yard. Following unsolicited drilling for oil under his property, Mohammed Al Fayed brought a case in 2010 claiming a fraction of the extraction proceeds. Under UK law, all mineral rights belong to the Crown for it to licence, and the case was thrown out, but a small fine was levied against the drillers for trespass. This has led to NUMBY-ism, where land owners, despite having no ownership of the oil, gas, or mineral resources under their land, make efforts to prevent exploitation deep under their property. This seems odd, especially to those in cities. With London in particular, many new infrastructure projects such as Crossrail run just a few tens of metres below thousands of domestic and commercial properties. In densely populated areas, negotiating with each and every property owner would make these projects unmanageable, and the benefits of more and better public transport would not be felt. This transport infrastructure that carries passengers from the country to the city and within it benefits rural and urban dwellers alike; why shouldn’t the same hold in the countryside? Whether or not a land or property owner has a direct interest in exploring for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> or preventing it, the current proposals focus on compensation – drilling companies must pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to communities affected – rather than permission. With the potential for court cases brought by NUMBYs to prevent drillers from getting to work, the government plans to make provisions that change the definition of trespass – part of the Infrastructure Bill mentioned in the Queen’s Speech, with details awaiting the outcome of consultation. To appease or appraise the risk? Firms – or at least one, Cuadrilla – are now submitting drilling applications to local county councils to recommence <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> in earnest. With high levels of truck movements for a year or more, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> is noisy and invasive to the immediate area around the well. During this time a considerable amount of water must be sourced and blasted deep below the surface, up to two miles down, at high pressure to free the gas from the shale rock. Much of this will flow back, bringing residues with it. And on top of this drillers must ensure the borehole captures the gas without letting it escape around the well, especially at shallow depths where it could contaminate the water table. It’s time we found out whether these risks can be managed. The possible disturbance from earthquakes, which stopped Cuadrilla’s Lancashire drilling last time, are a greater risk to the borehole infrastructure itself than to the local community, and so the driller has the greatest incentives to minimise them. The challenges of not just drilling but drilling safely have not been taken lightly and concerns are still key to the choice of drilling location. But the site is still key, and should allow access to a wide shale bed accessible by horizontal drilling. We can’t allow the rise of NUMBY-ism to prevent this. Risks shared There are risks to the driller too; once the investment in prospecting and drilling has been borne, the quantity of gas from the shale bed may not match expectations. Without a return on investment, there may be no future investment. For a limited number of sample wells and from as small a number of plots as possible, if the gas flow is insufficient then few if any new fields would be progressed. The communities that experienced the drilling could be compensated for their disruption, and the drillers would simply pack up and leave. Not acting is a risk too With North Sea oil and gas declining, the UK needs another comparable energy source if it is not to become more dependent on imported energy or face volatile and rising prices. If successful, the energy consumer and tax payer will benefit as well as the gas producer who takes considerable investment risk. Ultimately the greatest risk is not doing anything to ensure a continued energy supply. We need to gather results now from a sufficient number of wells to resolve if <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> can make a substantial contribution to the UK’s energy position or not, and that means removing some of the barriers that currently prevent it.

                                61 speeches and counting.Andy Rain/EPA The government’s legislative plan for its final year has been set out in the Queen’s speech. It most notably contains a recall bill that will allow voters to sack MPs who are jailed or who have committed “serious wrongdoing” according to the House of Commons. The recall bill was part of the coalition agreement of 2010. Also flagged are reforms to the pensions system (set out in the budget earlier this year), a tax allowance for married couples, the introduction of a plastic bag charge and a new infrastructure bill to open up more opportunities for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> in the UK. We asked a panel of experts for their view on these and other measures (and some that were left out) as the government heads into its final session before the 2015 general election. Recall bill Alan Renwick, Associate Professor of Politics and International Relations, University of Reading The government is proposing to allow voters to recall their MP by petition – but only when the MP has been found guilty of serious wrongdoing. That is a sensible policy. Failing to respond to popular desire for greater political accountability would only fuel voters’ anger with politics. But “total recall”, where a petition campaign could be launched any time, would sit uneasily with our parliamentary democracy, where government ministers need to be able to pursue the national interest even when local constituents oppose it. What is bad about the government’s announcement is the idea that it should be for the House of Commons to decide whether “wrongdoing” has occurred. Allowing politicians to act as judge and jury on their own peers just won’t fly in a 21st century world of sceptical voters. Pensions Iain Clacher, Associate Professor in Accounting and Finance, University of Leeds Much of what was here has already been announced, in particular the government’s plan to stop the compulsory purchase of an annuity for defined contribution pension holders on retirement. The announcement to allow for collective defined contribution (CDC) pensions is something new, however (despite being leaked earlier in the week). This is a much more significant change. In making this move, the government is going to allow for pension schemes that are much closer to the Dutch system of pensions where benefits can be reduced and enhanced depending on the performance of the fund. This may sound negative, but some estimates show that an individual could end up with a pension pot that is 30% greater compared to a traditional defined contribution pension. What is telling about both pieces of legislation is the conflict in policy between individualism and collectivism. The abolition of compulsory annuitisation places all the responsibility on the individual, while the commencement of CDC says that pensions and retirement savings should be collective as there are clear benefits to this. More worrying still is the fact that the US is trying to move away from individualism to a system of compulsory annuitisation, while the Dutch are trying to move away from CDC to something more akin to the UK system. Modern Slavery Alex Balch, Lecturer in Politics, University of Liverpool The expected announcement of the Modern Slavery Bill in the Queen’s speech fires the starting gun for the fascinating battle that will come next. Already heavily criticised for being too focused on criminal justice, with not enough for victims, there will clearly be problems if it remains similar to the previous draft version – and there is hardly the time for significant amendments. Considering her personal championing of the bill, its successful passage could rest on Home Secretary Theresa May’s resolve to push it through. It will be an interesting test of her power within the Conservative Party. Housing Ken Gibb, Professor of Economics, University of Glasgow The day after the European Commission warned about the housing market (saying many of the things UK commentators have been saying for years) and with strong rising real house prices, particularly in the south, we might have expected some action in this policy sphere. What we got primarily was the repetition of previous announcements and in one or two cases legislative proposals. The tenor, however, is: “we have prioritised this problem and our responses are the correct ones”. The government makes the assumption that its cumulative actions are demonstrably succeeding, for example that more house building is the result of planning reform and their market interventions rather than other factors. We may be building more houses but completion levels remain woefully inadequate. The proposals to help with development finance for small builders and repayable loans for plots are welcome and if the garden cities models can succeed, be replicated and actually support local communities and increased supply – all the better. But it is at this stage a prospectus and plan rather than guaranteed replicable reality. There are other proposals to expedite the acquisition of strategic sites by the Homes and Communities Agency, proposals to sell high value land for development, and also to allow builders to offset zero carbon pledges for all new homes. The government won’t adjust Help to Buy, and Right to Buy is set to continue in England, unlike Scotland where it is being abolished. There is scepticism that the receipts from these sales will translate into the promised equivalent numbers of affordable rented properties but we will need to wait in order to have a clearer sense of this over the next year or so. So in this year before the general election it looks as though any action to cool the housing market will come, if at all, from the Bank of England. Tina Fawcett, Senior Researcher at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute. The proposal that new homes must be built to a “zero carbon standard” from 2016 will entail reducing energy use through better insulation and good design, and generating more energy from renewable sources. But in the proposals laid out in the Queen’s Speech, “zero” emissions really means “low”. Eliminating the last 10-20% of energy use in a building can be expensive and technically demanding, requiring skills not yet widely available in the construction sector. So this not-quite-zero standard can be seen as a good pragmatic decision, to be revised later as skills and building techniques and technologies improve. However, details on the balance between higher building standards, on-site and off-site renewables are still to be negotiated, and it’s important to ensure the main focus remains on improving buildings. If the intended improvements are to be delivered in full, we need better enforcement of existing regulations to bridge the design-performance gap. Buildings' energy efficiency performance on paper usually far exceeds real-life results, with the result that householders face much higher energy bills and fewer environmental benefits. Because there is so little demolition in the UK, all new homes add to the UK’s energy use and carbon emissions; the question is by how much. So this standard must be a step towards truly zero-carbon homes. Free school meals Jane Ogden, professor of health psychology, University of Surrey It’s good to see this back on track after the recent in-house fighting about how it would be paid for. Children’s diets are often not only poor in terms of their nutritional content but can also show the early onset of bad habits and unhealthy attitudes to food. Free school meals will be a fantastic opportunity to encourage good eating habits and attitudes from an early age. Children will not only be guaranteed one healthy meal a day but school staff will be able to use lunchtime as a chance to role model good eating behaviour and can talk about food in a healthy way. These habits will hopefully continue through into adulthood and set them up for life. Energy David Elmes, Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School, University of Warwick The Infrastructure Bill in the Queen’s Speech would “support the development of gas and oil from shale and geothermal energy by clarifying and streamlining the underground access regime”. Headline writers will translate this as “It’s OK to frack under your house” and the speech refers to the ongoing consultation process on this matter. Whitehall has keenly appreciated the economic and energy security gains from the boom in shale oil and gas in the US. Policies that encourage investment to safely find out what’s possible are a good thing. In the US, landowners generally own the rights to the oil and gas under their property and companies wanting it must strike a deal with them. In the UK, rights belong to the Crown, and any Chancellor of the Exchequer with an eye on future government spending will look covetously at the potential licence revenue from more oil and gas production. So we have the ongoing game of carrots and sticks. The government seeks to keep its stake in the resources while encouraging the investment by companies to extract them, and marshaling public support through such means as requiring drilling companies to pay communities for their inconvenience. This is an example of an area where, if we want to encourage a new economic sector, we need to resolve a host of questions regarding policy and regulation. In contrast, the Queen’s Speech also discusses the North Sea oil & gas industry where changes are needed to support a maturing industry. Referring to Sir Ian Wood’s review, the speech calls for “a larger, better resourced regulator” to ensure the coordination and collaboration necessary to maximise the oil & gas from the North Sea. Put help for new sources of oil & gas together with more coordination of North Sea activities, add Electricity Market Reform and the prospect of referring power companies to the Competition and Markets Authority, the government’s more central role in the UK energy industry becomes clearer – something probably long overdue. Small businesses Richard Blundel, Senior Lecturer in Enterprise Development at The Open University Much will depend on the fine detail, and on how the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill fares in parliament, but there are positive signs. The department for Business, Innovation and Skills has clearly consulted small business practitioners and researchers – the Federation of Small Businesses have heralded it as a “landmark” – and it’s targeting many of the top problems reported by owners and managers down the years, including hardy perennials like improving access to finance and reducing “red tape”. However, the small firms are incredibly diverse and each of these problems is complex and pervasive. The bill will need to get to grips with the underlying issues rather than just courting popularity with a few headline-grabbing statements. For example, SME Finance Monitor data suggests that most small firms are not actively seeking finance, so access problems need to be deconstructed carefully to see what’s really going on. There’s also evidence to suggest that negative experiences of regulation are often a result of frequent, unexpected, arbitrary, and poorly implemented changes, so the whole concept of regulation also needs to be unpacked carefully. It’s good to see strong ethical interventions in areas such as abuses of zero hours contracts and unfair terms in the licensed trade, though paradoxically both mean new laws and statutory codes. I hope there’s a similar emphasis in the bill on reducing the considerable environmental footprint of small businesses, which extends well beyond plastic bags. Plastic bag charge Isabelle Szmigin, Professor of Marketing at Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham It’s debatable whether or not the proposed 5p levy on plastic bags could be described as a bold new bill, when the Environmental Audit Committee called the proposals “a complete mess”. But it should be taken seriously, and it has positive advantages for both consumers and businesses. Consumers may be a little disgruntled to begin with but the experience in both Wales and Ireland suggests they will soon get over it, and bringing bags out shopping will be as normal as picking up a chocolate bar at the checkout. There’s no harm in anything that makes us more thoughtful shoppers, even if we have to be forced to do it. And what is the benefit for businesses? “Bags for life” will become the norm – even if traditional shopping baskets don’t – and this provides an opportunity both for showing off their sustainability credentials, and more interesting opportunities for colour and design in the advertising messages they carry. If as is planned the money from the levy is put towards good causes, so much the better. As with smokers being sent outside, sometimes a bit of regulating behaviour can be a measure for good. Forest and National Park reform Frank Uekötter, Reader in Environmental Humanities at the University of Birmingham The proposals for direct elections to National Park authorities may be dismissed with reference to the plan for directly elected police commissioners, which was a mixed success at best. But then elections are as much about faces as about accountability, and national parks need the latter dearly. All over the world, we see conflicts over protected areas. Many park authorities have embraced “fortress conservation” and seek to fend off intrusions to their domain as best they can – not so much because it really works, but because they can. But things may change when an outsider with a elected mandate joins the board. The staff at national parks may need to explain more, to be more open. The rhetoric of ecology and biodiversity has long since morphed into an insiders’ code that many find hard to decipher. Of course, that is a very idealistic version of how things may turn out. But fortress games are much more fun with a mole behind the walls. Childcare reform Kitty Stewart, Associate professor, department of social policy, at the London School of Economics It is great to see childcare on the government’s agenda and in the Queen’s speech, with plans to introduce a Childcare Payments Bill. But the way government proposes to invest additional resources seems poorly thought out. The childcare scheme is misguided. The aim is to improve affordability for parents, and while the simplicity of the new system will be welcomed, there is no guarantee the extra funding will not just lead to higher prices (and, with our strong for-profit sector, higher profits rather than investment in quality). There are too few strings (indeed no strings at all) attached to the funding in terms of investment in qualifications and pay of staff and in terms of limiting price increases. On top of this, the scheme is regressive, channelling most resources to families that can afford to pay more. Developing a funding system which is equitable and promotes quality is not straightforward, but there are things we can learn from other countries about how to do it. The tax-free scheme has the feel of something worked out too quickly on the back of an envelope in advance of an election, without regard to what works and doesn’t work elsewhere. Left out: surveillance Alan Woodward, Visiting Professor, University of Surrey One notable omission from the speech was the Data Communications Bill. Originally proposed by the previous Labour administration, the latest draft was notified in 2012 by Home Secretary Theresa May, who wanted to ensure that law enforcement agencies could “maintain access” to data communications traffic, ostensibly for criminal investigations. However, the bill was quickly dubbed the Snoopers’ Charter by organisations and individuals who objected to the government being able to routinely gather personal data on innocent citizens and retain it for up to two years. The nickname probably explains why the bill has been dropped from this last Queen’s Speech before the next general election. The climate of public opinion following Edward Snowden’s revelations about the extent to which the US and UK government already monitor personal data would make it very difficult to pass legislation to make it even easier. With so much else to get into law before the next election, I suspect the government is keeping its powder dry on this bill until public anger subsides a little. The unfortunate consequence is that it does hamper attempts by the government to make more use of data to home in on criminal, extremist activities. The bill was a key part of the Communications Capability Development Programme (previously known as the Interception Modernisation Programme). The UK will not be left blind without it but it will mean that such activities take a great deal more effort. However, the UK has already enacted the European Data Retention Directive so it’s possible that the government may simply abandon the bill and rework it as an update to existing data retention law.

                                MrBingoBoingo writes with news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has settled federal civil charges with Erik Voorhees, a man who sold shares of two businesses in exchange for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoins">Bitcoins</a></span> without registering them. Voorhees must make restitution for the $15,000 in profit he made, plus interest, and a $35,000 fine. Here's the SEC's filing (PDF). "The agreement reflects an expanded effort by U.S. regulators to cast a wider net over the burgeoning <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin">bitcoin</a></span> economy.

                                The Platform is a regular column by mobile editor Dan Rowinski. Ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence and pervasive networks are changing the way humans interact with everything. Apple has long held the belief that it knows what you want better than you do. The concept was actually core to Steve Jobs's philosophy on product development: How could anyone know they wanted a personal computer if they didn't exist? And it worked, for a long, long time. “It’s not the customer’s job to know what they want,” was one of Jobs's favorite lines.  Jobs didn’t care if customers wanted custom ringtones. He didn't care if they thought that Flash was an indispensable standard for video on the Web. Jobs created iconic products with definitive designs and did not apologize for any of it.  At WWDC, Apple sent a message to its critics. All of a sudden, Apple is listening. If you are a fan of Apple products, this is unexpected good news. At 2014’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple executive Craig Federighi poked fun at design chief Jony Ive—and himself. Hair Apparent For instance, take the keynote of WWDC 2014. It was … funny. Cheeky. For Apple, that’s thinking different. It may present itself as a company that makes fun products, but Apple puts itself forward as a deeply serious company. Fun is for its customers. That changed when Apple CEO Tim Cook—a warm, avuncular presence, but hardly the best showman—handed most of the presentation over to senior vice president Craig Federighi, who oversees all of Apple’s software development. Federighi was the idol of the show. His coif—that thick mane of gray hair—was his costar. At one point, Apple showed what Federighi’s hair would look like on Sir Jony Ive, Apple’s rock-star designer who prefers the streamlined look of a shaved head. (The look works better on Federighi.) Steve Jobs's idea of a joke was landing zingers on the competition. Apple’s late cofounder was known for his stark earnestness and the ability to get the audience to believe that Apple’s new products were the best of the best. The WWDC 2014 keynote showed that Apple is beginning to emerge from the shadow of Jobs. Though the script of the WWDC keynote mostly followed Apple's template for past events, the sprinklings of dad humor were enough to make it feel fresh. Apple's not going so far as making fun of its own corporate foibles—still likely taboo in Cupertino—but humanizing Apple’s executives, most of whom are still relatively unknown to the wider world, is a smart idea. That Apple can mix up the product announcements and self-congratulations with a bit of playfulness shows excitement may not be dead at Apple after all. Apple’s ability to listen to criticism and change its ways wasn’t just noticeable in the WWDC keynote. It extended deep into the platforms the company released this year as well. Opening Up iOS (And Copying Android) Anybody that pays close attention to the differences between mobile operating systems will tell you that a lot of what Apple announced in its new iOS 8 software for iPads and iPhones takes a lot of cues from Google’s Android. Quick Thought: On Those 4,000 iOS 8 APIs In 2013, iOS 7 was significant because of how Apple redesigned the look of the operating system. At the time, I took a look at the developer capabilities underneath iOS 7 and realized that it was much, much more than just a pretty new aesthetic. With iOS 7, Apple gave developers some serious capabilities. It is early yet, but iOS 8 blows iOS 7 out of the water in terms of what it can do and what opportunities it gives to mobile developers. Look at the gaming capabilities and you can see how people envision the iPad as the next gaming platform console. Metal, SpriteKit, SceneKit and Game Center function together as a powerful set of frameworks for game developers. HealthKit, HomeKit and CloudKit allow Apple to take advantage of some of the most cutting edge trends in technology. In 2013, I said that Apple future-proofed iOS with iOS 7. This year, Apple has taken the future to a whole new level, giving developers the opportunity to build for the platform, outside of the platform, in the home, in a car or maybe even for your wrist. If you really take a look at what is in iOS 8, there is nothing "meh" about it. This is a distinct departure from Apple under Jobs—for whom Android was a subject of visceral disdain, not a rival to study and learn from. The most pertinent example of Apple listening to user requests is the ability to add third-party virtual keyboards to iOS. Apple has insisted since the launch of the first iPhone in 2007 that its own keyboard was superior and that it didn’t need the likes of Swype from Nuance or SwiftKey to satisfy users. Android has long been friendly to third-party keyboards and the inability to put them on iOS has been a factor in consumers switching to Android—or, once there, refusing to switch back. Apple has also copied some keyboard features from Android, like the new QuickType predictive text feature in iOS 8. QuickType will automatically fill in suggestions for you as you type, sometimes even personalizing the word to a specific person in your contacts list. Such text suggestions were introduced in Android years ago. Even BlackBerry had it in its ill-fated BlackBerry 10 platform. The new Spotlight search in iOS 8 now lets you search the Web (with Microsoft's Bing) in addition to giving App Store suggestions. In Android, Google search is, naturally, the default. See also: What Developers Need To Know About iOS 8  Apple’s personal assistant Siri can now be activated with just your voice by saying, “Hey Siri.” Several Android devices have been able to pull this off since last year (like the Moto X and Nexus 5) by saying “OK Google” or “OK Google Now.” The list goes on. The new iCloud Drive is essentially a version of Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox built specifically by Apple. The ability to put video previews in the App Store has long been a feature available to Android developers (through YouTube) on Google Play. Oh, you can now send voice messages in iMessage? WhatsApp, Voxer and a variety of other apps allow users to send walkie-talkie like voice recordings. The ability to sync photos directly from an iPhone to Apple’s cloud has been a feature for Google+ on Android since it rolled out in 2011.  Basically, if you look at a majority of consumer features that Apple rolled out in iOS 8, most of them can be found on a different platform or within popular apps—and many have been there for a long time. Apple is not likely to admit it, but the software builders in Cupertino seem to be responding to laments from users and enthusiasts about features present in Android and missing from iOS. And, for once—instead of offering rationalizations and excuses for its way of doing things—Apple listened, rolled up its sleeves, and gave the people what they wanted. Quote Of The Day: "Android fragmentation turning devices into a toxic hellstew of vulnerabilities." ~ ZDNet reporter Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, cited by Apple CEO Tim Cook at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference yesterday. Some may say that Apple has lost its mojo because it is cherry-picking popular features from other platforms and touting them as new and exciting in iOS 8. That’s one way to look at it. I’d argue that Apple has always picked up and refined features from around the industry. If anything, it’s just being less shy about it. And if the surface of iOS 8 resembles other reservoirs of technology, there is considerable technical ferment roiling beneath it. If you look beneath the surface of iOS 8 at the 4,000 new application programming interfaces released with the platform, you will see a powerful and flexible operating system that developers will be able to use to create tons of useful, fun and engaging apps. Innovation is alive at Apple. And that includes changing not just the company’s mobile platforms, but the company's own internal operating systems, its culture and habits and quirks and predilections. Apple has found its ability to listen to what customers want and for the first time in a long time, it is actually giving it to them, even if those features were introduced somewhere else first. More On Apple, iOS 8 And Mac OS X Yosemite Steve Kovach from Business Insider shows nine features that Apple ripped from Android or other platforms.  Walt Mossberg says all the borrowed features in iOS 8 are helping Apple keep people in its own walled garden. TechCrunch says: "Apple’s WWDC Delivers Developer Fanservice." Also from TechCrunch, Darrell Etherington says that the continuity features of iOS 8 and Mac OS X fundamentally change computing. He argues that the idea of tasks and processes persisting across multiple devices supported by the cloud is a fundamental change in how computing is done.  Mark Rogowsky at Forbes reiterates something I have said for a long time: Apple wants the iPhone to be the universal remote for you life. Forbes notes how Apple's stock sank after no iWatch was announced during the WWDC keynote. The real takeaway here: Wall Street is a terrible judge of technology and is only concerned with itself.  Eric Johnson at Recode notes the winners and losers from WWDC 2014. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, despite not being mentioned onstage, is a big winner.

                                Last week, queer Brooklyn rapper Mykki Blanco released her music video for "She Gutta." The film features burning crosses, footage from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> cameras of children running through streets and plenty of violence. But compared to Blanco's video for "The Initiation," in which the rapper mutters pitch-shifted Latin spells while sprouting a second face on top of his head, it was nothing. Music like this isn't exactly what most people think of as music. It terrifies, but it doesn't soothe or inspire. Yet audiences increasingly seek scary music. Once a subgenre of rap, horrorcore has moved increasingly into the mainstream through up-and-coming acts like Blanco or, more prominently, acts like Odd Future (who make scary threats to the people who call them horrorcore) or Kanye's now-infamous Yeezus. But there's a deep-seated reason we seek out this kind of music — why it feels so good to be terrified by grinding bass and pitch-shifted voices. Read More

                                The United Nations estimates that people in sub-Saharan Africa spend roughly 40 billion hours per year collecting water, and what they do find is often unsafe to drink. In some parts of Africa, finding potable water can be a six-hour endeavor.

                                A good dance partner knows that the name of the game is give and take. That live performance with another person is a constant two-way street of nonverbal communication and subtle accommodation. One partner is behind the music, and the other adjusts. A lift goes awry and the pair conspires, silently and instantaneously, to find a way to save it. Japanese dance group ElevenPlay released a video last week in which three female dancers endured the challenge of partners with a decidedly less-than-ideal level of interpersonal sensitivity. The dancers were joined on the stage of Tokyo's Spiral hall by three <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> — three quadcopter, pyramid-topped <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, to be exact, fashioned by Daito Manabe, a digital artist and programmer with a knack for generating unusual fusions of technology with the human body.

                                ON MAY 1st 2007 John Browne resigned as boss of BP, a British oil giant, his career apparently in ruins. A tabloid newspaper had exposed his affair with a male ex-prostitute. For the next few weeks Lord Browne was subjected to one of those trials by media at which the British excel. Three years later the Deepwater Horizon disaster, an explosion that led to the leakage of millions of gallons of oil off America’s Gulf coast, suggested that there might have been more serious reasons than his private sexual preferences to question Lord Browne’s tenure at BP. The disaster seemed to confirm both the worries of some analysts that he had sacrificed investment in a dash for growth, and environmentalists’ accusations that his rebranding of BP as Beyond Petroleum was just superficial “greenwashing”.Despite all the blows to his reputation, Lord Browne has done a remarkable job of reviving his career. He has built Riverstone Holdings, a private-equity company, into a powerful force in European <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>.

The company in question is Titan Aerospace, which manufactures what it calls "atmospheric satellites." Unlike traditional satellites, they operate around 20 kilometers (12 miles) above Earth, which is just short of the point of being in orbit. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> such as the Solara 50 look and operate similar to an airplane, but have solar panels on its wings, ...

The collapse means customers have almost certainly lost nearly half a billion US dollars in "real money." Mt Gox is a Tokyo-based business founded in 2009 as a trading card exchange (Source: wikipedia.org ). It has recently filed for bankruptcy protection because it has debt worth $63.6 million, but assets worth only just half over that.
