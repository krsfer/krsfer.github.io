                                Welcome to our new E-Commerce Insider newsletter, a morning email with the top news and analysis on the e-commerce industry, produced by BI Intelligence.  Click here to sign up for E-Commerce Insider today, and receive it every morning in your inbox.  ALIBABA ACQUIRES STAKE IN INTIME RETAIL: China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba has agreed to pay $692 million to acquire a 35% stake in Chinese department store operator Intime Retail. The deal will allow Alibaba to close the gap between online and in-store shopping in China. For example, consumers who shop at one of Intime's more than two dozen department stores might soon be able to purchase items with smartphones. Alibaba recently announced its plan to file for an IPO in the U.S., so many investors are trying to get a handle on the company's strategy. This recent deal with Intime Retail reveals that Alibaba is serious about going after the entire retail market in China, not just online. (Wall Street Journal) WOMEN AND MOBILE DRIVING INDIAN E-COMMERCE: Women and mobile shoppers are driving growth in the $3.1 billion a year e-commerce market in India, according to a new report from venture firm Accel India.  • Currently, approximately 130 million of India's 213 million Internet users access the Web via mobile devices. Accel projects that by 2016, when India's Internet population reaches 400 million, roughly 90% of consumers will access the Web via mobile devices.  • The number of working women in India grew 43% last year, which is having a major impact on e-commerce sales. Retail categories such as fashion, home decor, jewelry, and baby care are among the fastest growing retail segments in India.

As many as 20-40% of online clothing purchases are returned, so fashion retailers have a big incentive to solve this problem. One company, PhiSix, which was recently acquired by eBay, is trying to do just that. PhiSix allows consumers to apply their waist size, inseam, height, weight, and body build, to a computer-generated mannequin. When dressed, heat maps on the mannequin's body reveal areas where the clothing is tight- or loose-fitting. eBay hasn't figured out yet how it will apply this technology but it's an example of how technology can be used to improve the online shopping experience. (Washington Post) WAL-MART VS. VISA: Wal-Mart’s massive $5 billion civil antitrust suit against Visa could be the opening shot in the retail giant’s bid to establish its own payments network, say industry experts. The suit alleges that Visa and its large network of card-issuing banks engaged in “agreements not to compete and price-fixing schemes” in violation of federal law. The arrangement allowed Visa to collect fees totaling $350 billion over an eight-year period and inflicted “enormous damages” on Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, according to the suit. Visa did not respond to request for comment. The suit could be Wal-Mart’s attempt to “flex their muscles” as the company prepares to unveil its Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) mobile payments system, says analyst Madeline Aufseeser of Aite Group. MCX, a collaboration with a group of the nation’s top retailers, is likely to be a stand-alone payment network, meaning it has the potential to steal market share away from the large card networks. “They would like to see the Visa and MasterCard duopoly disintegrate,” says Aufseeser. GILT EXPANDS BUSINESS: Gilt Groupe's CEO Michelle Peluso says the company is expanding beyond flash sales to try its hand at selling full-priced merchandise. Experimenting with this new model, Gilt offered high-end boots for $600-700 each from designer Stuart Weitzman. Selling at full-price, Gilt sold more than $1 million worth of Weitzman boots in 20 days. Peluso says the idea to sell full-priced high-end merchandise was a result of customer analysis, and having a better understanding of just who was buying things on Gilt. "We know we have this very affluent audience and sometimes price is no object. We are working to take advantage of our audience and work with our brand partners in new ways," she said. (Internet Retailer)  PAYPAL IN STORES IN TORONTO. PayPal has announced that customers will be able to make payments at 50 different restaurants, bars, and food trucks in Toronto using the PayPal app, according to the Tornoto Star. The payment method doesn't require any tapping or scanning either. Customers check in with the PayPal app and place their order. Then, when they are ready to pay, the cashier identifies the correct account by selecting a photo of the customer displayed on the payment terminal and confirming the payment. (Toronto Star) HANDSHAKE RAISES $8 MILLION: Business-to-business e-commerce company Handshake is expanding beyond mobile order management to make wholesale retail more like e-commerce. The company recently raised $8 million from Emergence Capital to pursue its new strategy.

                                Here's what's happening in the next seven days in tech: Is it a bubble? On Friday, economists will be searching the jobs report for clues as to whether the tech boom is continuing or ending. The Nasdaq fell 3 percent last week. Candy Crush Saga maker King saw its IPO fall 20 percent last week, and Facebook fell 11 percent. Twitter, Pandora, Yelp, BlackBerry, and Netflix were all down last week. The economy is expected to create about 200,000 new jobs. Biotech sector has everyone worried. Will it continue its slide this week? Reuters says: "The Nasdaq biotechnology index NBI fell 7 percent for the week. With just one trading day left in March, the Nasdaq biotech index was down about 13 percent for the month at Friday's close." Uber will now begin battling headlines about the way male drivers can find female passengers' identities through their billing process. Micron reports earnings on April 3. Apple and Samsung: Today (Monday), jury selection begins in a San Jose federal court in the Apple v. Samsung patent case. Apple accuses Samsung of infringing on five patents. Samsung says Apple stole two of its ideas to use on iPhones and iPads. The key claim: Apple is demanding Samsung pay $40 for each device running software allegedly developed by Apple.

                                Payments Insider is delivered first thing every morning exclusively to BI Intelligence subscribers. WAL-MART VS. VISA – A NEW ERA IN PAYMENTS?: Wal-Mart’s massive $5 billion civil antitrust suit against Visa could be the opening shot in the retail giant’s bid to establish its own payments network, say industry experts. The suit alleges that Visa and its large network of card-issuing banks engaged in “agreements not to compete and price-fixing schemes” in violation of federal law. The arrangement allowed Visa to collect fees totaling $350 billion over an eight-year period and inflicted “enormous damages” on Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, according to the suit. Visa did not respond to request for comment. The suit could be Wal-Mart’s attempt to “flex their muscles” as the company prepares to unveil its Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) mobile payments system, says analyst Madeline Aufseeser of Aite Group. MCX, a collaboration with a group of the nation’s top retailers, is likely to be a stand-alone payment network, meaning it has the potential to steal market share away from the large card networks. “They would like to see the Visa and MasterCard duopoly disintegrate,” says Aufseeser. In a statement, Wal-Mart ties the timing of its suit to a recent class-action settlement, which the National Retail Federation has appealed. “If the settlement is approved … [i]nnovation around new payment technologies stands to be stifled, and consumers would face continually increasing hidden swipe fees, which already cost them tens of billions of dollars each year.” “Behind the scenes, Visa and MasterCard are somewhat concerned about MCX,” says Nick Holland, senior payments analyst at Javelin Strategy and Research. “Wal-Mart is in a certain position of leverage ... It’s kind of the perfect storm.” QUOTE OF THE DAY: "Many consumers and retailers may use the generic <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> transactions technology, saving on the transactions charge from conventional credit card and money transfer companies, but avoiding the I.R.S. reporting burden. So they will want to transact in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, but not hold it, and they will be pretty much indifferent [to] which [<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currency">digital currency</a></span>] they use. Exposure will be infinitesimally short," says Steven Englander, the chief foreign exchange strategist for Citigroup. (New York Times)  PAYPAL IN STORES IN TORONTO. PayPal has announced that customers will be able to make payments at 50 different restaurants, bars, and food trucks in Toronto using the PayPal app, according to the Tornoto Star. The payment method doesn't require any tapping or scanning either. Customer check in with the PayPal app and place their order. Then, when they are ready to pay, the cashier identifies the correct account by selecting a photo of the customer displayed on the payment terminal and confirming the payment. (Toronto Star) RETAIL BANK I.T. SPEND TO REACH $152 BILLION BY 2018. Globally, information technology (IT) spending at retail banks will grow from $118 billion in 2013 to $152 billion in 2018, according to a forecast by Ovum. One factor that will drive the growth is consumers' increasing adoption of digital banking channels. (Ovum 1, Ovum 2)  FASTEST PAYMENT GATEWAYS IN THE WORLD. Bank Innovation has a list of the world's fastest payment gateways for payments processing. E-commerce companies integrate payment gateways into their websites in order to accept credit card payments. Faster payment processing means faster checkouts for customers. This could in turn lead to increased customer loyalty. The companies that provide the top five fastest payment gateways as of January 2014 are Litle, SecureNet, TransFirst, Merchant e-Solutions, and Orbital. (Bank Innovation) UBS ON <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=BITCOIN">BITCOIN</a></span>. Investment bank UBS published a bearish report on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> echoing similar concerns voiced in an earlier report by Goldman Sachs. The report did say if a third-party were to set up a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>-like payments system it could create downward pressure on the fees that credit card networks charge for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> transactions. If this happened, it would end up hurting issuing banks which take a large cut of credit card processing fees in the form of interchange fees. (UBS) RETAIL BANKING APPS. When considering which feature to include in retail banking apps, global financial groups say that providing consumers with the ability to make small payments is a higher priority than giving them the ability to manage personal finances or to make payments to merchants, according to a survey by Finextra. This suggests more retail banks may move into mobile payments.  (Finextra)  Here's what else BI Intelligence subscribers are reading...

                                Social Insider is delivered first thing every morning exclusively to BI Intelligence subscribers. FACEBOOK'S SCRAPPED REDESIGN: We now know why Facebook scrapped its bold News Feed redesign, which was supposed to roll out last year. The problem: Not enough of its users had good enough or large enough devices that would do justice to the new look and feel of Facebook. During testing, the redesign "didn't work very well on a 10-inch netbook ... a single story might not even fit on the viewport," according to Facebook's product design director Julie Zhuo. (The Verge) This goes to a larger problem Facebook faces. With over 1.2 billion users, Facebook has to cater to the masses, rather than its most design- and tech-savvy constituents. That means Facebook will continue to have a lot of problems innovating and pushing forward. "This leaves [Facebook] vulnerable to startups that can build social sharing tools optimized for tablets, phones, and computers built with today's technologies. Those startups don't need a billion users today to keep growing until they can start taking ad dollars away from Facebook," Nicholas Carlson points out. (Business Insider) TURKEY STIFFENS TWITTER, YOUTUBE BLOCKAGE: Ahead of elections this weekend, Turkey further squashed citizens' ability to access Twitter or YouTube. Anyone using Google's Domain Name Service servers to get around the governmental ban are now redirected to the government's own servers, which continue to block access. Ars Technica points out that this means the government can also now record the IP address of anyone who attempts to access those services, adding another layer of repression to the blockage. (Ars Technica) EAT24 TAKES AIM AT FACEBOOK: A brand has now explicitly taken to its blog to cheekily take down the recent changes to Facebook's algorithm, which have limited brands exposure to their fans. Food delivery service Eat24 penned a Dear Facebook letter bemoaning the fact that their posts no longer get seen by the fans the company has spent so much time, effort, and money acquiring. The company has even decided to shut down their Facebook page altogether. Facebook was quick to fire right back, saying: “There is some serious stuff happening in the world ... and what we have come to realize is people care about those things more than sushi porn (but if we are in the mood for it, we know where to find it Eat24!).” (Re/Code, Eat24) FACEBOOK DESKTOP CALLS?: A new click-to-action tag, "Listen Now," noticed on Facebook's desktop API suggests that the social network will soon allow advertisers to include this option in their desktop posts. This feature had previously only been available on mobile and means that Facebook is likely adding more voice call features into the desktop service. (Inside Facebook) OCULUS VR'S STAFF NEWS: Newly acquired by Facebook, Oculus VR has just hired former Valve developer Michael Abrash as its chief scientist. The Next Web reports that Abrash has worked on virtual reality at Valve, as well as having worked on Microsoft's Natural Project. And in other Oculus staffing news, CTO John Carmack reports that he will stay with the company and is pleased with the acquisition. There was some question as to whether he would remain on, and his decision is an implicit endorsement of Facebook. (The Next Web, Engadget) DROPBOX CLOSES READMILL: As expected, Dropbox has announced that it will shutter the social reading app Readmill, which it just acquired. The acquisition was largely seen as a play for talent, so it's not a huge surprise that Dropbox decided to turn off the app. Readmill's apps will stop being available after June. (The Next Web) ZUCK ON INTERNET.ORG'S PROGRESS: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are major contributors to the Internet.org project, a consortium that seeks to bring Internet throughout the world. Now, the Facebook CEO has delivered a progress report on Internet.org's work so far. He explains that Internet.org will explore totally new ways to power Web access. And he explains which devices work best in which types of environments, comparing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, satellites, and lasers as a means of delivering an Internet connection. (TechCrunch, Internet.org) FACEBOOK ADDS GROUPS TO IOS MESSENGER: Facebook's iOS messenger app now allows users to put contacts into groups, giving the service a lot more utility. The new feature is part of the Messenger 4.0 update. Updates to the Messenger app though, inevitably raise questions as to what Messenger's future will be now that Facebook also owns the better performing WhatsApp mobile messaging service (CNET) WHERE FACEBOOK USERS WANT TO LIVE: Rental Roost, a company that specializes in the rental market and provides guidance on where consumers should rent, uses data from Facebook to understand what their consumers want out of their location. The company gave Inside Facebook a look into what they've found, uncovering interesting facts like that people in a relationship care most about what shopping is available in their area, whereas people who are married are more interested in fine dining options. It's another interesting example of the diverse types of services that can be built on top of Facebook's deep layer of user data.

                                Mobile Insider is delivered first thing every morning exclusively to BI Intelligence subscribers. NEW GARTNER FORECAST: Shipments of PCs, tablets, "ultramobiles," and mobile phones are expected to accelerate this year, achieving an estimated 7% growth and surpassing 2.5 billion units, according to Gartner. In 2013, device shipments growth came in at just under 5% compared to the previous year. Mobile phones will account for nearly three-quarters of device shipments, with about 1.9 billion units shipped this year. But mobile phone shipments growth is slowing, and it is actually the tablet market that will spur this year's overall growth. Gartner estimates that tablet shipments will grow 39% this year to reach about 270 million units. Markets outside of North America will take to low-cost and smaller phablet-like devices. PC shipments, meanwhile, are expected to decline about 7% as more notebook and desktop users continue to shift to mobile. Android is the platform winner. It will surpass 1.1 billion units shipped this year and grab nearly 50% of total device shipments. (Gartner) BLACKBERRY FINANCIALS: BlackBerry issued its full-year and fiscal fourth quarter financial results over the weekend. Full-year revenue is down 38% to about $6.8 billion, but BlackBerry's fourth quarter revenue sank below $1 billion and is down 64% compared to the same period last year. The company shipped a record low 1.3 billion smartphones in the fourth quarter, which is down from 1.9 billion in its third quarter and down from 6.2 billion in the same period last year. For the full year, BlackBerry's revenue mix consisted of 55% revenue from hardware. That's a bit misleading, though. Shipments plunged over the course of the fiscal year, falling to just 37% of revenue this past quarter, after making up 71% of total revenue just three quarters prior. (BlackBerry, BGR) With hardware sales falling, BlackBerry is refocusing efforts toward its services. Service revenue made up over half of BlackBerry's fourth quarter revenue, including services like enterprise mobility management and even BlackBerry's cross-platform messaging service, BBM. Messenger now has about 113 million registered users and 85 million monthly actives. CEO John Chen reiterated the company's plans to lean more heavily on BBM, saying during the earnings call, "We have a very solid BBM monetization plan." (TechCrunch) FAVORABLE EARLY RETURNS: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took to Twitter on Friday to post a screenshot of the iOS App Store to show that the Microsoft suite of Office apps for iPad occupied the top four spots on the Top Grossing chart for free iPad apps in the Productivity category. Meaning, Office for iPad users are not only downloading the apps with interest, but paid conversions for Office365 subscriptions are also coming in. Microsoft's Office for iPad apps are free to download but require a paid subscription for full use. (9 To 5 Mac) MICROSOFT'S BOLD TABLET PLAN: Microsoft doesn't just want to make a name for itself in tablet software, they also have big plans for tablet hardware. The company has set an internal goal of 25 million global unit shipments of its tablets this year, according to several Taiwanese supply chain firms as reported by Digitimes. That internal goal is five-times larger than the five million tablets Microsoft shipped last year. Most of those will be generic Windows tablets likely produced by third-party vendors, as Microsoft claims it expects its Surface tablet shipments to hit six million units maximum this year. (Digitimes) APPLE VS. SAMSUNG: Once again, the two smartphone competitors are squaring off in court over patents. This time, though, software will be at the center of the case, meaning it's really a battle between Apple and Google. "Apple is accusing Samsung of violating five of its software patents. Samsung contends that it licensed four of those features as part of Google's Android operating system, and that Google had been working on the technology before Apple filed its patents," according to the Wall Street Journal. Apple is seeking $2 billion from Samsung, and if the smartphone giant wins, Google may be forced to make changes to Android. (Wall Street Journal) POWERED BY ANDROID: Google has issued a small, but important mandate to all device makers powering their Android handsets with Google services like Gmail and Maps. When the device is powering up, the screen must now be emblazoned with a prominent "Powered By Android" stamp. This logo must be present on all devices that wish to have access to the Google Play Store. It's another way for Google to corral device makers to work off its vision of Android and to emphasize its brand on all devices powered by Google's Android.

                                Eurozone inflation. The reading for March came in at 0.5%, below the 0.6% expected and down from 0.7% in February. Market tests ECB. Despite the new reading, the Euro was up Monday and European stocks have retreated from early highs. Street consensus seems to be price gains have still not slowed enough to cause the ECB to panic. "Despite the low March inflation reading, the risk of outright deflation in the eurozone still seems small," the FT quoted ING as saying. "Our base case is still for the ECB to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday. "However, to avoid a renewed rise in the euro, [ECB president] Draghi may be forced to either beep up it forward guidance -for example by signaling more clearly that economic slack may keep policy loose for longer- or announce new liquidity measures." Ukraine. The U.S. and Russia agreed Sunday to resolve the situation in Ukraine without escalating tensions, but there remains lots of uncertainty. "Mr. Kerry said he had outlined some ideas for Russian President Vladimir V. Putin to consider that might lead to a reduction of the Russian forces near Ukraine. But it was far from clear how Mr. Putin might respond, or what he might demand in return," the New York Times said. Erdogan boosted. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AKP party won big in local elections. "The result was likely to embolden Mr. Erdogan to seek to extend his time in power, either by running for the presidency this year or by altering the rules of his party to stand for a fourth term as prime minister," the New York Times said. Regulator failure in GM probe. Federal regulators twice declined to open formal probes into complaints about faulty GM cars, Dow Jones reported. GM also rejected a proposed fix for the problem in 2005 because it would have taken too long and cost too much. "The findings by staff for the House Energy and Commerce Committee offer new details about events leading up to GM's recall of 2.6 million vehicles for ignition-switch defects now linked to 13 deaths." Markets. Stocks are up around the world. Emerging stocks are rallying to their seventh-straight day of gains, led by Taiwan, Indonesia, and Russia, the latter two up about 1%. S&P futures were higher.  Data. Not too crazy. At 9 a.m. we get ISM Milwaukee, 9:45 a.m. Chicago PMI, at 10 a.m. inventory and sales revision, and at 10:30 a.m Dallas Fed, which is expected to surge to 2.5 from 0.3. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> prices stand at $449. El-Erian on jobs day. The former PIMCO boss laid out three key points about this week's report on BI Saturday, and they boil down to: It probably won't mean much to policymakers, whatever its outcome. "For a while, the information content of the jobs report had evolved from providing lagging insights to also serving as an important leading indicator," he writes. "Today’s employment conditions, however, no longer act as a powerful driver of overall economic and political developments. That role has been transferred – to business investment when it comes to the considerable economic upside, and to geo-political risk on the downside. Goldman in Argentina. The megabank is negotiating a $1 billion loan with the troubled sovereign. "It would be the first time in more than a decade the country has received a substantial loan from international creditors and comes as the government seeks cash to avoid a further devaluation of the peso," Reuters says. The most dangerous fault in L.A. There was another earthquake in L.A. Friday, this time measuring 5.1. The real news is that the fault that moved, the Puente Hills, is considered to be much more dangerous than the San Andreas. "...a 7.5 quake on the Puente Hills fault could cause the fault to slip for 20 seconds — and the shaking could last far longer. Scientists say that quake would be more destructive than the so-called Big One on the San Andreas fault."   Join the conversation about this story »

                                Michael Lewis' new book Flash Boys comes out today. It's all about the confusing world of high-frequency, algorithmic trading. He was on 60 Minutes last night talking about the subject and promoting his book. In this short segment, he argues that the stock market is rigged. The first 45 seconds are the key part, wherein he explains the mechanism by which high-frequency traders get ahead of retail orders so as to inflate the price you have to pay for a stock. The basic mechanism that he describes is this: You place an order for a stock, say Microsoft. That order goes to something called the "BATS exchange" at which point high-frequency traders pick up on your order, and then race to the exchange with an order for Microsoft faster than you can get there. They buy the Microsoft and bring it back to you at an inflated price. So how big of a deal is this? According to Lewis, this is all adding up to billions of lost dollars, easy. Here's more from the 60 Minutes piece, wherein he talks about the impact on traditional investors: Michael Lewis: Brad realizes, "Oh my God, that's how I'm being front-runned. I'm being front-runned because my signal gets to the BATS Exchange first and they can beat me to all the, all the other exchanges." It only took a tiny fraction of a second for Brad's trade to reach the next exchanges on the network, but the high-speed traders were able to jump in front of him, buy the same stock and drive the price up before his order arrived, producing a small profit of just one or two pennies. But it was happening to everyone's trades millions of times a day. Ronan Ryan: That adds up. Steve Kroft: You make it sound like a skim. Ronan Ryan: What else would you call it? Michael Lewis: One hedge fund manager said, "I was running a hedge fund that was $9 billion and that we figured that the, just our inability to, to make the trades the market said we should be able to make was costing us $300 million a year." That was $300 million a year in someone else's pocket. There's also a big excerpt from Lewis' new book in the NYT magazine, which includes this fascinating passage, describing a Manhattan-based trader at the bank RBC: As it happened, at almost exactly the moment Carlin Financial entered Brad Katsuyama’s life, the U.S. stock market began to behave oddly. Before RBC acquired this supposed state-of-the-art electronic-trading firm, Katsuyama’s computers worked as he expected them to. Suddenly they didn’t. It used to be that when his trading screens showed 10,000 shares of Intel offered at $22 a share, it meant that he could buy 10,000 shares of Intel for $22 a share. He had only to push a button. By the spring of 2007, however, when he pushed the button to complete a trade, the offers would vanish. In his seven years as a trader, he had always been able to look at the screens on his desk and see the stock market. Now the market as it appeared on his screens was an illusion.

                                Good morning! Let's start the work week: Facebook had a beautiful redesign planned, but the design didn't work on the old, crummy computers that its billion users own. It was best for the latest and greatest computers that Facebook's engineers use. So, it scrapped the design in favor of something simpler. If Facebook has to give up on design innovations to appease its giant installed base of users, then it really is becoming the new Yahoo. Sounds bad, but Mark Zuckerberg seems aware of it, and that's why he's made some big acquisitions.  60 Minutes did a story on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> last night. All of it is known to anyone that follows Musk closely. But, there was a good line where he said that he thought Tesla would fail but did it anyway because he thought it was too important to not do. Apple goes to court with Samsung in a patent suit again today in California. This time, Google will be sending a lot of its people to testify for Samsung. Meet Lucy Koh, the judge that will be in charge of the case.  Guess which state has the highest percentage of cellphone-only households. Done guessing? The answer is Idaho.  The future of Google is a service called Google Now, but Google Now has stagnated and needs a serious tune up. A French tech site used some of the rumors about the iPhone 6 to come up with its own renders of what it might look like.  Trying to wrap your head around China's Internet giants? This interactive map from the WSJ explains who everyone is. Eat24, a food delivery site went public with its complaints about Facebook. It used to be in people's NewsFeed more often, but then Facebook changed its algorithms, and now it's not. Join the conversation about this story »

                                To my dismay I read this article while trying to enjoy my Saturday coffee. Once again the jewel in the crown of Australian science infrastructure is fighting for survival. This is a fabulous facility which has put out some awesome science of late and I would like to extend a massive “pat on the back” to my colleagues there. A whole heap of science awesomeness. John O'Neill Ok yes, I am biased. Those of you who’ve read my column before will recall that I was a post-doc at the Australian Synchrotron and I currently work for the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) which now operates it. But this does mean that I know how hard my colleagues there work, despite the funding challenges, to provide this vital piece of infrastructure for all Australians. I think one of the issues that the synchrotron has in communicating its worth, is that it is just too good. Outcomes from the synchrotron cross over all areas of science, with everything from blue skies to applied impacts. There have been a few explainers already pointing out what the synchrotron is, but perhaps it’s not clear that it’s actually ten instruments in one. Let me take you on a tour of them all, and show you how they are each solving Australia’s problems and supporting her industries. If you were to walk into the synchrotron, probably the first thing you would notice is a smaller building to the left that sits outside. This is IMBL, the Image and Medical Beam Line. This instrument is a real world-first. This beamline will hopefully be used to treat cancer one day. Using the biggest X-ray beam in the world (so the instrument boss Danny claims. He’s worked in most of the world’s big synchrotrons – so should know!), the scientists there are working tirelessly to understand exactly what photon goes where, so that it will be safe to treat people before too long. While they are working this out though, the beamline is available for to the rest of Australia’s scientists for imaging. The advantage of using this instrument, over a normal X-ray instrument, is the incredible 3D detail that you can pick out especially from soft tissue. Medium-resolution CT reconstruction of the vascular structure in a rat lung. James Pearson, Daryl Schwenke, Mikiyasu Shirai and Alberto Astolfo. So you now enter the synchrotron and say “hi” to Carlos the security guard, and start on your anti-clockwise journey about the ring. You’ll see the prototype magnets sitting there: red, green and yellow. These are a big feature for the educational program – every year 12 student studying physics in Victoria will get to visit these, when they visit the synchrotron as part of their course (just another impact the synchrotron has had). Next to the magnets is the enclave of the accelerator physicists that keep the machine ticking over nicely at 99.9999% the speed of light. Study using the synchrotron itself has lead to results that helped out its bigger brother the Large Hadron Collider in its own (Nobel prize-winning) efforts. But it’s no surprise to see some physicists at the synchrotron, eh? So let’s keep wandering round the ring. The next instrument that you’ll bump into is XFM, which stands for X-ray fluorescent microscope. You’re as likely to see museum conversation scientists working on this instrument as physicists. This is the pretty picture beamline and you’ve probably seen images collected on this amazing instrument in many a high-profile news story. But there’s some hard-hitting science behind these pretty pictures. With the occurrences of skin cancer as high as it is in Australia, you’ll want to be sure that the sun creams that everyone needs to use are safe. Earlier this year, scientists working at XFM presented findings that our body can break down zinc oxide nanoparticles. By carefully measuring the chemical composition of the nanoparticles through sequences of images, researchers at the Australian Synchrotron, Monash University and Melbourne Centre for Nanofabrication, were able to assess how immune cells break down these tiny particles. Australian Synchrotron/Simon James The next instrument you’ll arrive at is actually two. The Macromolecular crystallography (or MX beamlines) are so useful that from the outset two instruments were constructed to serve the world-leading chemical and biological crystallography communities of Australia. Using these instruments researchers from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) could get images of how insulin actually interacts with proteins in our body. Published in Nature, the results of this will lead to a better understanding of diabetes (an estimated 3.3 million Australians will have diabetes by 2031) and, to quote the scientists themselves: If we did not have this fantastic facility in Australia and their staff available to help us, we would simply not have been able to complete this project. Wave to Worrell, who works in stores, as you pass and wander up to the Infrared beamlines. There are actually two branches to this instrument, so that two groups of scientists can work on it at once. These instruments can detect tiny molecular vibrations, which have a great number of applications including helping to diagnose diseases from scanning a patient’s skin. Affectionately know as the “softies” about the ring (sorry guys), the next instrument you’ll arrive at is the Soft X-ray beamline. These guys are hard-hitting in the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a></span> world and are the go-to places to undertake a number of tricky experiments. But studying samples under a super-low vacuum (it really sucks – boom, boom), they can detect the tiniest details on a surface. One upshot of this work is the potential to use these surfaces to select the right kind of drug molecule to synthesise. Wax on, wax off … From the “softies” you’ll come to the SAXS/WAXS beamline, which is the small angle and wide-angle scattering instrument. You can, pretty much, collect data here from every type of sample imaginable, whether it is built of nanoparticles, fibres, proteins – or even wine. The wine industry in Australia is valued at A$7 billion, and balancing the tannins within the wine is essential. Using this instrument, Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) scientists found the shapes of a number of tannins and can use this information to improve and tailor the flavours in the wines of Australia. What tannin molecules actually look like when dissolved in water. The size and shape of these tiny molecules plays a part in how a wine tastes. Australian Synchrotron/Nigel Kirby Coming nearly to the completion of the round, you’ll next find the XAS beamline (or X-ray absorption spectroscopy). This is a technique that you cannot do without a synchrotron and has a number of highlights – one of which is determining where you find nutrients in grains, making sure you get the most out of a A$155 billion agriculture economy. And last, but no means least, you’ll arrive at the Powder diffraction beamline, or PD. Very close to my own heart, this is my old stomping ground. Aside from my own work, we would have as many as 300 scientists a year visiting us, with many of these investigating materials that will change our energy economy (such as lithium ion batteries, the market of which is due to rise to A$44 billion in a few years). Using this instrument researchers can watch where the lithium ions are moving to as the battery is charged and discharged, with the hope to designing them to store more energy. You only have to look at much more debt-ridden countries, such as the UK and Spain, who have continued to invest in their own synchrotron facilities. Let’s not take a short-term attitude to what the synchrotron can achieve. From this tiny tip of the iceberg that I’ve toured you through, you can see how the synchrotron will generate billions for the Australian economy. If we took the synchrotron out of the equation we’d not feel the effect tomorrow, or even next year, but slowly and building over time the Australian economy would suffer. So do you like it? Do you think we should put a ring (fence) around the synchrotron’s funding?

                                Every day, millions of internet users leave comments on web sites and on social networks covering any topic imaginable. At its very best, commenting fosters a social community of people sharing an interest. The community can work to create new knowledge, expand and explain, bring different perspectives or just be supportive and encouraging. At its worst however, commenting can sink to depths of excoriating and vile invective. It can simply provide yet another opportunity for different groups to hurl abuse at one another and cement even further their respective entrenched positions. To ban comments or not? The average commenting community usually falls somewhere in between and for some sites, this has been sufficient incentive for getting rid of comments altogether. The online magazine Popular Science decided to ban comments, quoting research that showed that rude comments increased the likelihood of readers questioning the content of the article. In this case, uncivil comments caused some people to evaluate <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a></span> as being more risky than readers who had been exposed to only civil comments. The editors of Popular Science felt that this distorted unreasonably and arbitrarily the science being presented in their articles and felt justified in taking the step of banning comments altogether. Incivility may have effects on our attitudes to the content that is being commented upon, but in the case of YouTube, comments had simply become generally unpleasant. In an attempt to deal with this, Google has progressively enforced a “real name” policy including having to use a Google+ account in order to comment. The idea that anonymity increases bad behaviour on forums is one that is supported by research. Through a process of online disinhibition, behaviour tends to be more uncivil and groups become more polarised when individuals are anonymous. Insisting on real names Contrasting this is the observation that uncivil comments were found to be more prevalent on the online version of the Washington Post, where commenters can be anonymous, as compared to its Facebook version. Interestingly however, where rudeness did occur in both environments, on the online version of the Washington Post, the incivility was directed at other participants, compared to Facebook where it was directed to political figures and others not directly involved in the commentary. This observation has been taken up by the Huffington Post, which despite employing comment moderators, has observed the increase of trolling, griefing and generally bad behaviour over recent years. Next month, it will introduce the requirement for commenters to use their real names. How exactly they will do this is unclear. Relying on Facebook or Google+ accounts is one way. This assumes these services have an effective means of ensuring their own users are using their real names. However, we know that this is not really the case as it is still possible to set up false names on any service at present. The other question is whether this will effectively stop bad behaviour. YouTube’s experience indicates real names hasn’t eradicated the torrid comments. This may be in part because on a service like YouTube, there are so many people commenting that a real name operates in the same way as a pseudonym anyway. If you expect nobody to know who you are in a social group, there would not be any of the social norming effects moderating behaviour. Community, not customers Certainly when the articles are on emotive subjects and the problem becomes one of warring factions, real names are a non-issue because being identified ceases to become an inhibitor. Declaring your allegiance to the group is part of the motivation of engaging in the argument (or fight). Reducing the problems of commenting down to a single factor of identity versus anonymity is missing the point. As with all relationships and especially ones encompassed in social groups, the situation is far more complicated. Having a commenting community on a site is much more about the social network aspects of that community than it is about simply engaging customers. In order to have an effective community which is organised around an interest, it largely falls to the site owners to try and cultivate that community. Turning to the social sciences for an understanding on how to build effective online communities, researchers have outlined a slew of evidence-based design features that can be used to build and regulate those communities. These design suggestions are based on normalising behaviour to achieve a constructive, informative and civil conversation. What works? Some of these suggestions may actually surprise comment moderators currently dealing with the task of shaping an online community. For example, some sites leave a trace of comments that were removed by moderation. This works as what is called a “descriptive norm”, an example of how people should behave. But research has shown that if there are too many of these traces, they can actually illicit even more bad behaviour. Another suggestion is that commenters that display bad behaviour are far more likely to moderate that behaviour if they are given warnings and face-saving ways of amending their behaviour. Although anonymity and identity are one aspect of the overall healthy functioning of an online community, they are only a small part and like all relationships, the truth is that “it’s complicated”.

                                Now that Microsoft Office is available on the iPad, it's a runaway hit: The three apps in the mobile productivity suite are sitting solidly at the very top ranks of Apple’s App Store. Here’s how to get started. First, Make Room For Office All of the apps are sizable, running between 215 and 259 megabytes just to install. Together, they’ll take up nearly a gigabyte. If you have an older iPad or one with smaller capacity, or you store a lot of music and movies on it, this may be a concern. The apps rapidly expand in usage, too: In just a few hours of testing, Microsoft Word had expanded to take 500 megabytes on my iPad. All of the files you work on and store locally will require their own space. So make sure you have at least a few gigabytes free. If you don’t have enough space, delete unused apps or consider reducing the amount of media you store on the device. (This may require syncing your iPhone with a cable and using iTunes.) Next, Find The Apps When Microsoft first launched iPad versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, they were hard to find in the App Store, buried under Office substitutes like CloudOn and office-themed games. But now, when you search for “Microsoft Office” in the App Store, the three apps show up as you'd expect. Apple’s also currently lending Microsoft a hand by featuring them on the App Store, making them even easier to find. Still, you may be better off by searching for “Word”, “PowerPoint,” and “Excel.” (There’s no all-in-one office suite like you have on desktop devices, or like Microsoft’s Office Mobile app which offers simple reading and editing of text documents, presentations, and spreadsheets.) If you’re still having trouble, you can follow these links: Microsoft Word for iPad Microsoft Excel for iPad Microsoft PowerPoint for iPad (There's also a version of Outlook for the iPad called “OWA for iPad”; it appears to be Outlook Web Access with a simple software wrapper to turn it into an iPad app. It doesn't have the same kind of native look and feel that the new Office apps have, so we'll leave it out of this discussion.) How To View Documents For Free This is most of what can be done with an open document in the free version of Word for iPad. The free version of Microsoft's Office apps only let you view documents. The first problem you’ll run into: How do you get those documents on your iPad? There are two main options: email attachments, and Microsoft’s OneDrive service, an alternative to Dropbox or Google Drive that offers some free online storage. If you have an Office document in your email, press and hold down on the attachment in Mail. You’ll get a dialog box that offers Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint as an option for reading the document. The app will store the file locally. If you use Hotmail or Outlook.com for email, or play with Xbox Live, you already have a Microsoft account you can use to sign up for OneDrive. Otherwise, you'll need to create a new Microsoft account. Either way, you’ll get 7 gigabytes of free storage. If you move documents into your OneDrive on your desktop, you'll also have access to them within Office iPad apps. Once you've gotten the file into the app, you can view it for free.  Saving an uploaded Word document with the free version of Word for iPad. What you can't do unless you pay up: edit or share those documents. Taking A Look Inside Word For iPad Here’s more of what you can do without a paid subscription: The Open menu is the workhorse. This is where you can add more OneDrive accounts or SharePoint Sites, if your workplace uses that software. The Recent menu shows what documents have been accessed in the past.  Once a document is open, the Home, Insert, Layout, Review, View and Picture menus are live, but all of the tools below them are grayed out. The only exceptions are under the Review and Home menus. Under the Review menu, you can press Show Markup for comments, insertions and deletions, formatting, revisions. Under the Home tab, the Show/Hide Paragraph button is live so you can see paragraph breaks. Additionally, there are a few icons across the top of the screen above the ribbon. They include a familiar back button, a File icon that when pressed shows document properties, and a Help and Support section. AutoSave doesn't work, because you can't make changes to a document. Other options under the File menu are grayed out, too. On the top right side, there is a search icon and a share icon, but only the search function is enabled. Sharing files via email or as a link is not enabled on the free version.  What You Get When You Pay To really get the benefit of Office for iPad, you need a subscription to Office 365. For home users, this costs $99.99 a year or $9.99 a month, which covers installing Office software on up to five PCs and five tablets. For business users, there’s a variety of pricing plans—but if your employer’s paying for it, you’re probably not too worried about those details. One immediate bonus: Your OneDrive storage gets bumped up by 20 gigabytes. An Office 365 subscription unlocks most of the features you’d expect from the desktop versions of Microsoft Office. Since we’re working in the cloud here, AutoSave is the order of the day. You can turn it off under the File menu in the upper left. For OneDrive documents, saving there is done automatically unless AutoSave is toggled off. When we are done with editing, we can go press the Back button in the upper left, and if AutoSave hasn’t captured the most recent changes, a dialog will appear indicating that it’s saving changes to OneDrive. Using the toggle without a mouse is smoothly enabled here via touch on the iPad. You can now share documents too, with the Share menu at the top right. Choices under this menu are Email as Link, Email as Attachment and Copy Link. Email as Attachment doesn’t give the option of sending the document in view-only mode, but Email as Link does. Copy Link saves a shareable link the clipboard, for posting on social networks, sharing via instant messenger, or other uses. One big option you won't find: printing. Unlike Google, which offers cloud-based printing services for Google Docs, Microsoft doesn’t have this feature yet. It's coming soon, the company says. Digging Into Excel And PowerPoint The other Office apps for iPad have similar file-management functions. But they have special features designed for editing spreadsheets and presentations on a tablet. Again, you'll need a paid subscription to Office 365 to enjoy these—otherwise the apps are view-only. With a paid subscription, Excel for iPad has a special numeric keypad that includes formula buttons. This fancy numeric keypad is only available on the iPad, and it’s actually quite necessary do to the limited screen size. Creating new spreadsheets with the iPad is definitely easier with the numeric pad, and the formula button <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span> speedy calculations. Some features seem easier on the iPad version than on the desktop, like changing currency formats. One complaint: There's no way to scroll down beyond swiping, and that makes navigating large spreadsheets a bit unwieldy. There’s another possible fix for Microsoft in the near future. The free PowerPoint version is likewise limited, but it's perfect if you just want to use your iPad to power a presentation. An icon on the upper right allows you to present. To use AirPlay, Apple’s built-in feature for sharing screens, you have to use Apple’s system menu that’s accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. One improvement Microsoft could make: AirPlay support built directly into the app. The paid version includes editing features and one really handy bonus: a laser-pointer effect that appears when you press and hold the screen for a long time. This laser pointer is a nice touch (no pun intended) to PowerPoint for iPad. How To Upgrade To The Paid Version There are two main ways to get an Office 365 subscription: Inside the app as an in-app purchase, in which case you’ll use your iTunes login to buy a $99.99 annual subscription. Online on office.microsoft.com, which allows you to choose the monthly $9.99 option or the $99.99 annual one. Microsoft may prefer that you use the second option, since Apple gets a 30% cut of the purchase when you use iTunes to buy it. But buying your subscription online instead of inside the app is confusing, because the website prompts you to download Microsoft’s Office apps through the desktop version of iTunes. Since you've already downloaded the apps, skip this confusing step. Microsoft’s website and its apps don't clearly explain this to you, but all you have to do to activate the paid features is log in with the Microsoft account you used to purchase your subscription, and the app will enable all the paid features. (If you have an Office 365 subscription through work, log in with the associated account your employer gave you.) Once we logged in, the app recognized that we were now Office 365 subscribers. With our now fully capable Office apps in hand, we could begin sharing and editing documents across devices, in real time. That’s what makes Office for iPad most useful. Is it worth the price? That's a question only you can answer, but we suspect it comes down to how much you use Office documents in your work and life already—and whether your workplace is already paying for it.

                                A turbulent last few months have seen numerous pieces announcing the end of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, its imminent collapse, or the bursting of the bubble. Commentators are missing the point: the key to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s surprising resilience lies outside of traditional economic thinking. Mark Williams of Boston School of Management predicts that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> will drop to $10 a share by the first half of 2014. In recent months <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> transactions have been curbed in China on the orders of the central bank, declared illegal in Russia, and associated with money laundering. Yet subsequent to each apparently terminal problem – the latest of which was the bankruptcy of the largest <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchange site, Mt. Gox – and wave of ensuing negative coverage, after an initial substantial drop <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> has picked up value again fairly rapidly. Remarkably the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchange rate still sits at somewhere between $500-600 (at last check, although this is prone to drastic fluctuations). This suggests that the numerous economists who have prematurely dismissed <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> are at least missing something in their analyses. The electronic currency was created in 2009 by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakomoto -– possibly a group of hackers and cryptographers -– and operates as an electronic peer-to-peer network transaction system that works through an expanding chain of numbers. This cryptographic system generates a fixed number of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and the currency is released at 15-minute intervals in set quantities, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> will reach a final total of 21 million by 2140. They are released through a process known as mining, although the currency is most commonly acquired through exchanges with national currencies. Mining consists of expending computer power at considerable environmental cost to find the hash key that generates the release of the next set of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Bubble The consensus amongst the majority of economic bloggers seems to be that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is not a viable currency and a bubble that is soon to burst; most famously the Nobel laureates Paul Krugman and Robert Shiller have expressed this view. If <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s continued high valuation after several reportedly terminal crises should tell us anything: it is that it may be a bubble but it is not a conventional one, and this is because owners of the currency have longer-term political and ideological reasons for holding it. Dismissing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> as a financial bubble misses precisely what is most significant about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>: First that it shows that alternative forms of community currency not created or backed by the state are at least possible. Second, it suggests people can invest in currencies and assets for other more durable reasons than short-term economic gain, like underlying beliefs and political ideology. Arguably economists have been so confused by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> because these are both points that contemporary mainstream economics tends to neglect. One of the main reasons why <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> may well be a bubble in the longer term is that there is a tendency to hoard the currency as some (but not all) individuals keep hold of it in the expectation of a continuing increase in value. Yet the finite number of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> means that its value as a currency is limited, since if individuals see their <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s as a store of value rather than spend them this damages its status as a currency. Consequently <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> drifts towards having a strong financial asset status as many people keep hold of the currency. With national currency, of course, central banks have the option of printing money when there is a lack of liquidity. This tendency to store has been noted in some social network analysis research, which estimates that in the first part of 2013, 64% of newly mined <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> were not circulating. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Community While <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s status as a currency may not be sustainable, its continuing value as an asset does require further explanation and this can be found in the community of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> holders. Social anthropologists seem to be one of the few groups of writers that give primary attention to the underlying character of this community. For example, in the most extensive survey of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> community to date with more than 1,000 participants, curiosity and politics are strong reasons for holding the currency ranking closely alongside profit. The survey also finds that the community seems to be overwhelmingly male and economically libertarian in spirit. In the context of political and economic beliefs there are clear echoes of the Austrian School of economists and Ludwig Von Mises. As Von Mises notes in The Theory of Money and Credit: “It is not the state but the common practice of all those who have dealings in the market, that creates money”. In line with Von Mises a key aim of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> network is to challenge the idea that only the state can maintain a money system. The economic libertarianism of parts of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> community seems to be anti-central banking, anti-governmental oversight and anti-state intervention. The community has changed in recent months, for example hedge funds have become more involved in the currency. How could speculators resist an asset so free from regulation and so volatile? Parts of the community are likely to be less enamoured of this than others, but presumably if you’re a good economic libertarian –- which <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> owners tend to describe themselves as – you think that speculation is par for the course. In short, let the market decide. Whether we have any sympathies with this political agenda, or whether we would strongly reject it. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> does illustrate that the durability of assets is determined by the beliefs of the communities that sustain them, and when an asset is underpinned by political values this can only add to its longevity. If something as volatile and improvisatory as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> can generate and sustain a significant degree of traction despite major set backs, surely it is only a matter of time before another electronic currency asserts itself on an international stage. In online circles a number of alternative candidates, like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></span> and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Litecoin">Litecoin</a></span>, are already circulating.

Two of the fires started after the cars ran into objects in the road, damaging the lithium ion battery. The last occurred when the driver ran into a concrete wall going 110 miles per hour, Musk said.

                                For awhile, conventional wisdom said the world of CRM was particularly harsh for newcomers. With behemoths like Oracle, Salesforce and Microsoft, there just wasn't much room for startups. But much has changed over the last few years, and the CRM space is now alive and well—and more competitive than ever. Disruptive technologies in mobile and breakthroughs in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> are finally being applied to major pain points in the world of “salestech,” where tools that weren't necessarily built specifically for sales are being used for sales purposes anyway—because they get the job done. My earlier posts on CRM examined the challenges LinkedIn brings to this market and the well-funded ventures gaining significant traction in the space. Here, we will look much further down the innovation pipeline to examine early-stage ventures, where one can apply the “barista test” to an array of new tools. See also: 3 CRM Challengers LinkedIn And SalesForce Should Worry About Can I check out this new tool while waiting for my coffee? If it looks interesting, can I start using it while drinking my coffee? This "barista test" eliminates all the enterprise-y systems that that somebody chooses for you or require a backend. It also eliminates the cool-sounding Private Beta tools that you cannot actually try out today. Mobile apps tend to score well on the "barista test," since any actions can be performed with one hand, negating the need to fire up the laptop, but I don't apply that as a mandatory filter because there are still great tools that have not yet translated to the smaller mobile screen. Here's the real test of greatness: Will you use this tool tomorrow? Can this tool become a habit you use every day? There are some overlaps between many of the younger salestech ventures—for example, all ventures use email and social in some way—but those companies tend to cluster around four main themes. Relenta And Streak: For bringing CRM to email There are only so many hours in the day. If we spend all our time in a CRM system, we have less time in our email inbox, and vice versa. The reality is that when we need to take action—to "follow up" with people—we usually use email. So why not bring CRM into the email? That reasoning led me to use Relenta when I was COO of ReadWrite in 2009, but it had one big flaw: It made me leave Gmail and use Relenta's email system. Relenta was great for my productivity once I decided to switch, but once I left ReadWrite, I reverted back to Gmail. Now there's Streak, which raised nearly $2 million in VC funding in 2012, which literally brings CRM into Gmail. Streak is not CRM-specific; its mission is to fix "the frustration of constantly having to switch between their inbox (where they do their work) and separate systems.” So Streak could certainly apply to any executive and any back-end system, but I'm confident it would resonate with salespeople. Mobile email is at a pretty good place right now, so an e-mail centric CRM is automatically mobile-friendly. Streak may work best for those people who do some sales/relationship management but don't necessarily define themselves as "sales professionals" (perhaps 20% of their time is spent selling). Streak is great for those people that don't want to use a CRM system, but would like a bit of CRM functionality in their email. Nimble And LittleBird: For bringing social to CRM Self-appointed social media gurus will tell you "how to use social media to drive revenue," but these concrete methodologies usually lead to spam. Social media should be a conversation, and so should selling. The two should be one user experience, and one workflow. Nimble does this elegantly. Nimble probably won't displace Salesforce or Oracle/Siebel in enterprise accounts, but it may take a big share of the SMB market for CRM that's currently wide open. If sales is what you do for a living and it's up to you, give Nimble a try. You can be up and running in minutes and it could end up saving you a lot of time. See also: LinkedIn Vs. SalesForce: Clash Of The Sales Technology Titans Nimble automates what good salespeople already do manually, which is valuable since time is our most precious asset. However, if you look for something that will give you competitive advantage and put you a step ahead of the average sales guy, try LittleBird. This was built by Marshall Kirkpatrick with investment from Mark Cuban and others. (Disclosure: I worked with Marshall at ReadWrite in 2009 and like him, but no I don't have any financial interest in his venture.) Marshall built LittleBird from his experience as a journalist where you have to quickly assemble lists of experts and influencers by domain. It's like Klout, but where one's influence measured by their domain. Somebody smart and famous may have a high Klout score, but that's irrelevant if, for example, you are writing about new technology in the cloud stack and you're only interested in connecting with experts in cloud stack technology. So how does a tool for journalists translate to sales? In the same way journalists seek out influencers and report on their activities, salespeople must also find those domain-specific influencers and influence them to sell others on their technologies. In both cases, you need to keep track of your influencers, and LittleBird helps you do that. This is particularly useful in sales when you're bringing a horizontal tool into new vertical markets and you need to quickly connect with people that matter in those markets. DataHug: For bringing business intelligence to your CRM Mature ventures in this space include InsideView and RelateIQ, which we covered in an earlier story, but there is also DataHug from Ireland, which “analyzes the contacts your company is emailing and scheduling meetings with," allowing teams to "find warm leads into potential customers, partners and recruits. See also: How To Hire The Enterprise Sales A-Team DataHug hits on a big issue: Our personal LinkedIn connections are good, but it still feels odd to "connect" to new colleagues just to see their connections. A CIO or sales VP might well get indigestion from all that relationship capital leaving the company. Business intelligence for CRM still has a long way to go. Salespeople live on snippets of intelligence all day long, and the smart ones keep their ears open for opportunity all the time. The big win happens when salespeople can alert users just in time after an event happens that can a) signal opportunity, b) signal the deal is in danger, or c) provide an interesting talking point to connect with a prospect. This kind of real-time intelligence requires data collection from many sources (e.g. Glassdoor, Google News, LinkedIn, Twitter) and alerts you on your mobile device while you're on the go. Aggregating external sources on companies is important, but since that data is non-proprietary, you can save time by aggregating it automatically. Though it doesn't always generate a competitive advantage, it allows you to also integrate internal, proprietary data in parallel, which is how you achieve the bigger win. Trello: For aligning resources to your sales projects If your image of a salesperson is a door-to-door salesman or one of the guys from Glengarry Glen Ross, it would probably look like the salesman is a solo act. This is simply not true in big ticket enterprise sales, where the sales executive is the point person, the orchestrator of resources—such as sales support, maintenance, product management, senior management and outside partners—to get a deal done. In CRM systems, coordination matters. (Perhaps that's why they're hated by so many salespeople but beloved by so many managers.) But is it possible to have one tool that everyone can agree upon? I have seen one candidate, and that is Trello. Trello comes from Joel Spolsky's team—no VC money involved at all. ReadWrite uses Trello for tracking the general flow of stories from concepts to finished articles, but Trello's system of "boards" and "cards" can be easily applied to managing a sales pipeline. See also: How To Manage A Sales Team In The Era Of Bring Your Own Everything Trello feels like it was “born-mobile." The small screen interface works well, and it totally scores high marks on the barista test. It is the one tool on this list that I find myself using regularly. It is also naturally viral; I get invited onto Trello Boards and invite others onto Trello Boards I have created. Salestech CRM is finally exciting again, with lots of innovative new tools to try out. These are just six examples, so let us know which CRM tools you prefer in the comments section below.

The collapse means customers have almost certainly lost nearly half a billion US dollars in "real money." Mt Gox is a Tokyo-based business founded in 2009 as a trading card exchange (Source: wikipedia.org ). It has recently filed for bankruptcy protection because it has debt worth $63.6 million, but assets worth only just half over that. Customers had a total of around 750,000 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s stored in the Mt Gox equivalent of a bank account, which translates to around $ ...
