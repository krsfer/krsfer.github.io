                                The Federal Aviation Administration no longer be able to stall on privacy guidelines for private <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> operation in the United States. President Barack Obama is set to issue an executive order to create privacy guidelines for private <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s operating in U.S. airspace, according to Politico. If executed, this order would put the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an arm of the Commerce Department, in charge of developing these guidelines. Until now, privacy guidelines for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s were considered to be under the domain of the FAA, which is currently embroiled in the lengthy process of crafting regulations for operating commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in U.S. airspace. However, the FAA has yet to address photos and other personal information potentially collected by private <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, a move that's been criticized by both lawmakers and consumer groups. See also: Why Commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> Are Stuck In Regulatory Limbo Brendan Schulman, a lawyer who specializes in litigation involving unmanned aircraft systems, told ReadWrite the measure lines up with the FAA’s earlier testimony. “The FAA has never had a mandate concerning privacy, and in Congressional hearings has indicated that it would look to other agencies to develop any necessary privacy policies for commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s,” he said. “There is no obvious agency to take this on, so it seems the President made a decision to specifically designate NTIA as the lead agency to study the issue. My understanding is that the result will be privacy best practices, not necessarily regulations.” Congress has set a 2015 deadline for the FAA to develop its regulations. Internationally, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are used for delivery purposes, crop surveying and maintenance, search and rescue, and more. White House officials have not made it clear when the President will be issuing his order.

                                AT FIRST glance it would appear that China has gone online, and gone digital, with great gusto. The spectacular rise of internet stars such as Alibaba, Tencent and JD would certainly suggest so. The country now has more smartphone users and households with internet access than any other. Its e-commerce industry, which turned over $300 billion last year, is the world’s biggest. The forthcoming stockmarket flotation of Alibaba may be the largest yet seen.So it is perhaps surprising to hear it argued that much of Chinese business has still not plugged in to the internet and to related trends such as cloud computing and “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” analysis; and therefore that these technologies’ biggest impact on the country’s economy is still to come. That is the conclusion of a report published on July 24th by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), a think-tank run by the eponymous consulting firm. It finds that only one-fifth of Chinese firms are using cloud-based data storage and processing power, for example, compared with three-fifths of American ones. Chinese businesses spend only 2% of their revenues on information technology, half the global average. Even the biggest, most...

                                Laced with disease-causing bacteria.EPA More than two-thirds of chicken produced in the UK is contaminated with disease-causing bacteria, an investigation by The Guardian has revealed. Although the bug can be killed by proper cooking, it is estimated more than 300,000 people in the UK get diarrhoea from this bug every year. More than 100 people die as a consequence, and many more developing long term neurological and gastrointestinal problems. Despite the burden of disease caused by the bacteria called <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> jejuni, it has remained “under the radar”, unlike the scares caused by bacteria such as Salmonella and Listeria in the 1980s and 1990s. The problem of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> is on the top of the agenda for poultry producers and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and a major concern for our major retailers, but The Guardian believes that not enough is being done. The intensive nature of production, transport, slaughter and processing gives the bug many opportunities to spread through flocks and between carcasses. In a large chicken processing plant, 200,000 animals may be slaughtered and butchered each day. If the first flock on the line that day has <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> infection, then there is a good chance that many of the whole birds or chicken portions leaving the plant that day will be contaminated. Good hygiene, cleaning and following the correct procedures are vital in reducing these risks, but it would seem corners are being cut and errors are being made that impact directly on food safety. How can the spread be controlled <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> jejuni is in your chicken. De Wood, Pooley, USDA, ARS, EMU., CC BY Spread of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> is difficult to control in chicken production. Usually the bug survives in vast numbers in chickens' intestines. Although it can occasionally make chickens ill, it is normally carried with no observable effect on the bird. The bug also spreads very quickly within a flock. It is not clear where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> comes from, though the practice of “thinning” is the single largest risk of a flock becoming infected. The practice involves selling lighter chicken for early slaughter to avoid overstocking, whilst retaining the remainder for slaughter at a greater weight. The controls that have been successful in reducing Salmonella in chickens are less effective in reducing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span>. There is also no vaccine available. Some methods of controls are under investigation by FSA and the poultry industry. These include blast chilling, lactic acid treatment and bacteriophage treatment, but they are costly and in most cases of questionable efficacy. Ultimately it is a difficult balance between providing cheap and nutritious food and maintaining food safety for an industry that operates on small margins. There is no specific legislation for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> control, such as there is for Salmonella control. Introducing any legislation will increase cost, which could push production overseas where chicken can be produced even more cheaply but where standards in hygiene and animal welfare are lower. Longer-term solutions Ultimately on-farm controls, such as vaccines or breeding of birds that are more resistant to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> infection, are likely to be more successful. However, these are some way off and need greater support from government and industry. The focus on quick solutions to meet FSA targets on reduction of carcass contamination has to an extent ignored long-term solutions. Another worry is that emerging variants of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> are more likely to leave the gut and contaminate the liver or muscle. This would make controls after slaughtering even less effective as they would be unable to penetrate into the organs. The question I am often asked is: “Do you eat chicken?” The answer is “yes … but I ensure that any chicken I eat is thoroughly cooked and I always practice good hygiene within the kitchen to avoid cross contamination”. At present this is the best, and perhaps, the only thing that can be done to reduce the risk of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> infection.

                                EPA/Atel Safadi While there is violent disagreement about who is to blame for the unfolding catastrophe in Gaza, there is less argument about its consequences. A rapidly rising – primarily civilian – death toll is difficult enough to contemplate, let alone justify. Eventually the fighting will cease and talks will begin. The only question is how many women and children will be slaughtered between now and then. Things might have been different. When John Kerry was appointed as US Secretary of State, he nominated doing something about the ‘Palestinian question’ as one of his key foreign policy goals. Given how many of Kerry’s predecessors have tried in vain to address this problem, it always looked likely to prove a triumph of experience over hope. Even a passing familiarity with the historical record of American engagement in this part of the world should have given significant pause for thought. Ironically, at least part of the problems have been caused by the United States. It is not controversial to suggest that no other state exercises as much influence over American foreign policy as Israel. John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt’s important book may not have earned them many friends, but it did a valuable service in revealing just how powerful and influential the Jewish lobby is in the US. The possibility that any American president or Secretary of State will be able to deal even-handedly with the protagonists in this conflict is simply laughable. There are two crucial points to make about this. First, and most importantly, it is not anti-Semitic to point this out. Israel’s lobbyists have become highly skilled at shaping the dominant discourse in this area, and the stock response is to paint critics as closet anti-Semites. This is simply unjust and gets in the way of any reasoned debate about the issues. Israel’s policies should be treated and assessed in exactly the same way as any other state’s. Not to do so actually is racist. Second, the biased nature of American foreign policy is undermining its credibility and influence in the Middle East. While American standing in the world has recovered dramatically since the dark days of the Bush regime, the one exception is the Arab world, where only 30% of respondents have a favourable view of the US according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Centre. Soft power may be going out of fashion at present, but it still has its merits. It’s hard to persuade people to behave differently if they doubt your motives. The limits of hard power are even more apparent for those with eyes to see. All states may have the right to defend themselves, but if any population ought to know something about excessive force, brutality and persecution, it ought to be the people of Israel. Whatever the historical rights and wrongs of this conflict may be, killing innocent women and children is never a good look – even worse when they’re already in intensive care. It is a measure of how hopelessly destructive this struggle has become that both sides seem willing to wade through the blood of innocents in pursuit of their goals. Perhaps Hamas really is entirely cynical about the carnage being caused among its own people, but it is worth considering how such a cold-blooded calculus can be sustained and why so many young men have become its willing accomplices and victims. There is no surer recipe for social disruption than lots of angry young men with no jobs, status, future or stake in a functioning society and economy. Mix in ethnic tensions and unresolved historical grudges and the preconditions for conflict are all too evident. But when these are played out with the confines of the Gaza strip it is a recipe for a pocket-sized apocalypse. Gaza and Perth (where I am fortunate enough to live) have one thing in common: they both have populations of a bit more than 1.5 million. Gaza’s population is packed into 365 sq kms; Perth’s enjoys about 2500 sq kms. Living in Gaza would be hellish enough at the best of times. Living there under constant bombardment would be enough to induce despair. The idea that people could seek safety in such circumstances is simply risible. There are plainly no easy or obvious answers to what is one of the most intractable problems on earth. Outside powers can, however, treat both sides equally. This means that the US, and Australia for that matter, cannot give unqualified, uncritical and unending support to one side. Even friends can behave badly at times. Letting other countries know when they have crossed the line of acceptable behaviour might be in everyone’s interest. When the UN suggests that Israel may have committed war crimes, clearly something has gone badly wrong. The Palestinians may be suffering most directly, but Israel’s bone-headed, intransigent insistence on using its vastly superior military force to try and solve what is ultimately a political problem can do it no good either.

                                Mo doesn't run on McDonalds.Owen Humphreys/PA Being an athlete is all about eating pasta morning, noon and night, right? Think again. The type of sport an athlete does will affect the types of foods the competitor should eat. Although there are other important nutrients (such as fluid, vitamins and minerals), the three main ones in your diet (known as macronutrients) are <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>ohydrates, proteins and fats, and these are the ones that sports nutritionists tend to focus on. Across the board Most athlete diets tend to be low in fat, as eating an excess of fat (or calories) will result in this being stored as fat on the body. This can be a major problem for aesthetic sports, such as gymnastics, but is an issue in most sports, where you don’t want to carry around dead weight. Carbohydrates are the main energy sources, and are particularly important in endurance events such as triathlons and marathons. Carbohydrate-rich foods include pasta and porridge. In events lasting more than an hour, athletes will also need to refuel during the event. This is often done with sports drinks or sports supplements, which can be an easy form of fuel for an athlete. Proteins are important for rebuilding micro-damage to muscles caused by exercise. This is why protein is a key part of the diet in weightlifting. A weightlifter’s diet will consist of low-fat, protein-rich foods such as chicken or egg whites. Some major differences Even within similar sports there can be major differences in optimum diets for an athlete, which is purely down to the length of the event. One of the best examples of this is athletics, where distances in running can range from the 100m sprint to the 42.19km marathon. As you burn more calories in a longer distance event, the marathon runners will need higher levels of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>ohydrate than sprinters. Marathon runners will probably “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>-load” for the week before the event, where they increase the amount of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>ohydrates they eat everyday, at the same time as cutting down the amount of training they’re doing. This balance of energy in and energy out means that they’re able to top up the storage <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>ohydrate (glycogen) in their muscles and run for longer before they fatigue. As the 100m sprint is such a short event, it relies more on anaerobic energy systems – those that require less oxygen than the aerobically fuelled marathon. Both will use <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>ohydrates as the energy source, but as the marathon is longer, it requires a lot more. This means that sprinters might focus on eating less pasta than marathon runners, as pasta can give a large amount of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>ohydrates compared to something that usually comes in a smaller portion or with a lower <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>ohydrate content, such as fruit and vegetables. Marathon runners will also use stores of body fat more to fuel their longer distances, although this can’t be used without <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>ohydrate. The body’s stores of glycogen will only fuel 90 to 180 minutes of endurance activity, so they will still need to keep topping up their <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carb">carb</a></span>ohydrate intake during the race if possible. Eating iron-rich foods such as red meat will also be more important for a marathon runner than a sprinter as it is an essential component of haemoglobin, the protein in blood that transports oxygen around the body. This is especially true for women, who have a higher need for iron anyway, due to their menstrual losses. As such, they’re more prone to the effects of having low iron. There are some similarities between different distances. For short and long there is a fine balancing act between eating sufficient calories and macronutrients to make sure they have the energy to train and compete, and not eating too many so that they gain body fat. This could have disastrous consequences on performance for an athlete, and increase their time on race day. It’s important to remember that these are just guidelines. Diet is very much an individual choice, and an athlete will eat what they are comfortable with. Usain Bolt claimed he ate up to 100 chicken nuggets a day during the Beijing Olympics – arguably rich in protein, but also full of fat. Those seeking to emulate Bolt’s lightning speeds, should note that most of the time he follows a healthier plan of meat, fish, bananas, yams and traditional Jamaican dishes. Maybe he would have recorded even lower times if he stuck with his healthier, lower-fat diet during the Beijing competition. Ultimately, however, it’s a case of what works best for individual athletes.

                                First bodies of victims in the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash arrive at Eindhoven Airbase, the Netherlands.AAP/Dan Himbrechts The first of the bodies from Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 have arrived in the Netherlands ready for forensic investigation into the remains of the 298 passengers and crew. Identifying the victims is going to pose many challenges given the potential state of the bodies and remains, both from the initial explosion and the delay in recovery, but dental records can definitely help. It is not unusual for forensic science to investigate mass disasters and crimes, such as the 2001 World Trade Centre attacks in New York. Neither is it unusual for forensic experts from different countries and organisations to participate into the one investigation, such as Nairobi’s Westgate mall attack in 2013. But it is unusual when the incident occurs in a conflict region or area where there is no defined jurisdiction or hardly any legal structure to default to. This applies to the forensic investigation relating to the downing of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 in eastern Ukraine. There are legitimate questions relating to the jurisdiction – if any – in place, the security of the evidence and the safety of the expected forensic team of experts. Armed separatist soldiers guarding the debris at the main crash site of flight MH17. EPA/Robert Ghement This is especially so when the militant groups who are accused of downing the aircraft and therefore creating the crime site will themselves be guarding the crime scene and the forensic experts expected to work at the scene! As a proper forensic investigation has been so far deliberately or unintentionally delayed, concerns relating to the accurate identification of victims' bodies become more confirmed. As time passes, more crime site contamination is expected to occur along with the decomposition of victims’ bodies. The transfer of the first 40 bodies to the Netherlands is only now taking place after they were left in fields for several days of hot summer weather. Overcoming time, temperature and contamination Research in forensic medicine and forensic odontology can offer some reassuring news for families and friends of the victims. Dental identification has always played a key role in natural and human-made disaster situations especially in identifying victims of fires, and victims of mass disasters and aviation disasters. In cases where a body is charred, conventional autopsies and DNA profiling become problematic and very limited in certain situations. Bodies in these instances can be disfigured to such an extent that identification by a family member is neither reliable nor desirable. But the teeth often remain a good source of identification in those situations. Ongoing forensic research in Egypt has been evaluating the changes in the root density and morphology of the teeth subjected to extremely high temperatures equivalent to that resulting from aircraft’s explosion. Digital dental radiography was used to investigate the possibility of using these changes to identify bodies exposed to extreme heat. A perfect match of all the examined points along the horizontal section copied from the pre-burning radiograph (right) and superimposed on the post-burning one (left). Dina Shokry Research results confirmed that measuring the root density on direct digital radiographs and comparing the antemortem and postmortem values is a reliable tool for identification of bodies exposed at temperatures up to 1,100°C for durations up to 30 minutes. Digital radiography is a preferred choice in any mass casualty situations where the number of victims overwhelms the ability of forensic examiners to quickly and accurately identify decedents. It’s also useful where other tools of identification may be restricted, problematic or time-consuming. In the MH17 case, digital dental radiography can be employed for identification purposes as the teeth of the victims are not as vulnerable to contamination and immediate decomposition as other evidence and parts of the body are. In addition, the creation of electronic teeth-radiographs can be easily networked and transferred between forensic scientists on site (eastern Ukraine and the Netherlands in this case) and their peer colleagues at laboratories wherever they are, including Australia, Malaysia and the UK. These advancements in forensic science mean investigators may be able to contain much of the mess already done on the disaster scene. Identifying the victims’ bodies and remains is not only a legal and moral requirement towards human dignity but also an impartial step for the families, friends and colleagues to help grieve their loss. The unaccomplished mission But the mission of forensic science is not only in identifying the victims' bodies and remains. The major role of forensic science is to assist in achieving justice. An armed man walks past bodybags with bodies of victims at the main crash site of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. EPA/Igor Kovalenko Forensics will play a critical role in crime reconstruction, providing scientific explanations to understand the sequence of events relating to the downing of the Malaysian aeroplane. By doing so, forensic experts will assist in bringing offenders to trials. Among all the political and military battles, this forensic battle seems very hard to win in a contested area with hardly any jurisdiction or legal framework in place. Forensic science – first and foremost – is defined as “science pertaining to law”. But in the MH17 case we have to wonder to which law will forensic science pertain? Will it be to the Russian law, Ukrainian law, the rebels’ rules and orders, international law or that at the Netherlands from where the MH17 departed but never landed or Malaysian law its intended destination? This is a difficult question in a difficult region where political interest seems to override any other interest.

                                Helen McCrory as Medea. Richard Hubert Smith/National Theatre A new production of Medea recently opened at London’s National Theatre to critical acclaim. This is a Medea definitively set in the modern era: the production opens with two little boys watching television snuggled in sleeping bags. These contemporary touches are present throughout, whether in the duty-free spirits in a plastic bag, the smoking, or the modern wedding with a tiered cake and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helium">helium</a></span> balloons. Often when ancient plays are updated to a modern setting it can feel unsatisfactory. Frequently there are elements that grate or become implausible, and you’re left feeling that the director is trying too hard to make the play “relevant”. But in the case of Medea, the tragic action seems to fit today’s world as well as that of the mythological past. It speaks to our imaginations with incredible power. In Greek mythology, Medea was the granddaughter of the sun god Helios, and ran away from her father’s house to marry the hero Jason. Euripides re-sculpted her story in his play, adding the element that made her the Medea we know today – the woman who kills her own children to avenge her husband’s betrayal. Medea (about to kill her children), Eugene Ferdinand Victor Delacroix. In the earliest versions of the myth, Jason and Medea’s children are killed by a crowd of Corinthians, angry at Medea’s behaviour. Greek tragedy likes to rework older myths to bring out the nastiest aspects of human relationships, especially within the family. Euripides makes Medea breach a fundamental taboo: the bond between mother and child, and the assumption of unconditional maternal love. So the first audience who saw Euripides’s play would have been in for something incredibly shocking, unfamiliar as they were with a Medea who kills her children for vengeance. When the play was first performed in an Athenian tragedy competition of 431 BC, it came in last place, and it’s often thought that this was because of the heroine’s dreadful actions. But regardless of the first audience’s response, the play quickly became a classic, and Medea’s infanticide supplanted all other versions of the story. Mothers wilfully killing children has a particular horror, but it’s a sad fact that it isn’t as rare as we might like to think, and stories about women accused of the crime regularly hit the news. Indeed, Medea’s situation bears a chilling resemblance to current research on maternal filicide. She’s been abandoned by her husband in a foreign land where she has no support network. Isolation, low social status, and stress have been cited as crucial factors in maternal infanticide both in humans and in primates. Medea’s motivation is a desire to punish her husband, a major category used by researchers investigating the background to such crimes. One research article even suggests that mothers are more likely to kill male children if their motivation is vengeance: Medea’s is, and her victims are both sons. Medea (Helen McCrory ), Jason (Danny Sapani) and their sons (Joel McDermott and Jude Pearce). Richard Hubert Smith/National Theatre Not only are Medea’s actions psychologically realistic, but so is the way that other characters respond to them in the play. A research study from 2006 examined more than 250 news reports on maternal infanticide in the US to see how journalists present these cases. It concludes that women tend to be presented in over-simplistic terms, either as being driven to insanity due to caring so much, or as fundamentally heartless. At the start of the play, Medea screams hysterically off-stage. At the same time, her nurse describes her as incapable of controlling her emotions due to deep grief. And after the killing, when Jason confronts Medea, he claims that “no Greek woman would have dared to do this”, implying that Medea acts as she does because she is a “barbarian” and morally “different” to a civilised person. (Jason is wrong, of course – there are other examples in Greek myth of women who kill their children). Both Jason and the Chorus try to present Medea as inhuman to make sense of her actions: she is called a stone, iron, and a lioness. The implication is that a proper human being would be incapable of acting as Medea does (and so perhaps, that “normal” people are safe from such things). Modern reporters similarly present mothers who kill as “mad or bad” to help provide distance. But what’s truly shocking about Medea is that for most of the play she seems neither irrational nor evil. Euripides points to the broader societal pressures that lie behind what she does. She argues that her situation is an inevitable hazard of the patriarchal rules governing marriage in the Greek world: women are dependent on their husbands, vulnerable, and easily driven to desperation. The chorus of Corinthian wives accepts this argument and promise to help Medea achieve vengeance, swayed by the idea that they too could have been in her place. Danny Sapani as Jason. Richard Hubert Smith/National Theatre Nor does she kill in a state of irrational frenzy or emotional detachment. In a monologue before she commits the murders, Medea acknowledges the wickedness of what she is about to do and expresses her love for the children, and the deep pain she will feel at their death. Yet although Medea is in a desperate situation, it’s clear that she doesn’t see killing the children as the only option. She kills, not from the belief that she can’t cope, nor because she thinks the children will be taken away from her, but out of a cold awareness that this will be the most effective way to destroy Jason’s life. The power of Greek tragedy lies in its ability to offer the audience space to explore the very worst-case scenarios. It helps us confront the gap between our ideals about the world and our actual experiences of it. Family relationships are framed by a set of stereotypical societal values: mothers are loving and altruistic, fathers protect and provide, children are dutiful and make their parents proud. We, like the Greeks, know that that life isn’t always like this: marriages can be destructive and family members hurt each other. Tragedy explores the ultimate expressions of our fears that life will disappoint us. They allow us the space to question what happens if marriages aren’t just damaging but actually murderous. Or if parents aren’t just inadequate but set out to destroy their children. It’s Medea’s ability to uncover our worst fears, combined with its psychological plausibility, that makes it as terrifying today as it was almost 2500 years ago.

                                A new collection takes stock of the four decades that have passed since the publication of Dennis Altman's landmark book, Homosexual.malstad, CC BY-NC-SA Noted Works is a new series on The Conversation devoted to long-form reviews of significant new books. See the end for further details. Dennis Altman was a young, articulate activist and out gay man when Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation, the book for which he is probably best known, was published in 1971. For people like me, including many of those who contributed to After Homosexual: The Legacies of Gay Liberation, who were teenagers or Altman’s peers, Homosexual changed the way we saw the world and engaged with non-homosexuals. The way the world was, the way it is Coming as it does, 40 years after and as a celebration of the publication of Homosexual, After Homosexual contains accounts from Altman’s confreres of the way the world was then and also from younger men and women of how similar and different the world is that Dennis Altman envisaged when he wrote about the conditions of gays and lesbians in the late 1960s, early 1970s. UWA Publishing Written by way of a festschrift, After Homosexual: The Legacies of Gay Liberation comprises three sections. The first, “Looking Back”, includes extracts from the work of Dennis Altman and his contemporaries at roughly the time Homosexual was released. The second section, “A dossier of gay liberation texts”, mostly comprises written and pictorial documents from the time the book was published. The third, “Moving on”, includes accounts of how Homosexual affected academics and activists since its publication. Editors Carolyn D’Cruz and Mark Pendleton provide a succinct context to the time when Homosexual was published and the 40 years of gay and lesbian scholarship and activism since then, which their contributors chart in the chapters of After Homosexual: The Legacies of Gay Liberation. Activist-academics themselves, the editors seem not entirely convinced by the recent turn in queer social agitation: For “us” the promise of an emancipatory vision for altering the structures of love, sex and kinship cannot settle at the present struggle for the “right” to exchange vows at the altar. In a nutshell, then, this book attempts to cover some of the controversies as well as the spirit and social/political colour of the times slightly prior to and when Homosexual was published, provide some measure of its impact then and since then, and consider its legacy in the light of social developments since the mid-1970s, such as gay men’s response to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, the rise and subsidence and seeming rise again of the queer movement, and more recently social movements concerning non-heterosexual immigration, parenthood, and marriage equality. Altman’s contemporaries on his legacy Among peers and contemporaries of Dennis Altman who write in praise of Homosexual are academics Raewyn Connell, Jeffrey Weeks, and Garry Wotherspoon. Raewyn Connell, University Professor at Sydney University, provides a concise survey of the liberationist movements fomenting in the 1960s as context to understanding the strong currents for change that swept members of unions, universities, and social action groups together to work for racial, sexual, and economic improvement. The new left, she writes: embodied politics [that] couldn’t stop in the streets: that is, the public arena as conventionally understood. “Being there” politically … applied to households, classrooms, sexual relations, workplaces and the natural environment. And so the political was understood as personal, enabling ordinary people to be involved in the politics of the day, a strategy that a decade later included individuals refusing to buy oranges from South Africa in the hope their action might hasten the fall of Apartheid. Connell’s outline of the practices of the new left provides a picture of the political milieu in which Homosexual was written and published. They were heady days when among other institutions built were, “Double-J radio, the Free University, the Pram Factory theatre, the Hindmarsh Women’s Community Health Centre … the network of women’s refuges, the gay liberation press, the Disadvantaged Schools Program…” The late 1950s, early 1960s are the focus of Garry Wotherspoon’s contribution, in which he states that gay liberation was borne out of time of state-sanctioned persecution of gay men and other sexual outsiders. The Cold War, Wotherspoon reminds was a time when it was no longer safe for gay men to be open about their sexuality as some had been during the second world war, especially in cities like Sydney and Brisbane that were host to hundreds of thousands of US servicemen on rest and recreation leave, not all of whom sought comfort in the arms of Australian women. About this period, which was approximately a decade after the formation of ASIO, Wotherspoon writes, “the Sydney superintendent of police proclaimed that the two greatest threats facing Australia were communism and homosexuality”. Dennis Altman himself wrote in another of his influential works, The Homosexualisation of America, the Americanisation of the Homosexual (1983), that until the end of the sixties, to be a homosexual in more western countries: was to experience a life that was largely furtive, shameful, and guilt ridden; most homosexuals shared only too strongly the social condemnations against them. Elsewhere, I have argued that gay men developed their sense of self, sexual and political identities when they were taking part in the other popular movement of the late 1960s, early 1970s, the craze for disco dancing and nightclubbing that spread from San Francisco and New York to other western cities such as London, Paris, Sydney, Amsterdam, and Berlin. Wotherspoon and other historians have argued that gay-libber activists were aware at the time of the limited appeal their consciousness-raising meetings had in comparison with the physical and erotic liberation thousands of gay men expressed on Friday and Saturday nights and identities they fashioned in bed, at beats, and on the dance floors of gay clubs and bars. (See for example, Wotherspoon’s 1991 book, City of the Plain: History of a Gay Sub-culture.) In the 1970s, gay men were not alone in their desire to dance away Friday and Saturday nights or have lots of sex. Our swinging decade followed in the footsteps of heterosexuals’ swinging sixties as sexual liberation broke when women got control of their fertility with the Pill. For young men and women, it was a time of wonder and experimentation, social, sexual, and political. Historian John Foster was a young man then and wrote of the dawning of the 1970s in the following terms in 1993’s Take Me To Paris, Johnny: “It was an awesome climax, that moon landing, to a fabulous summer: Woodstock, Stonewall, and then the moon”. While hetero sexual liberation and gay liberation overlapped, they had quite different agendas according to US historian David Allyn, who wrote of the period and the contrast between the two movements for sexual liberation in his book Make Love not War: The Sexual Revolution, an Unfettered History (2001): For straights, “sexual liberation” often meant personal, psychological transformation — freedom from hangups. For gays, personal liberation required social and cultural change — elimination of repressive laws, the abolition of damaging stereotypes, the relaxation on public displays of homosexual affection (like holding hands and kissing). From the archive Part two of After Homosexual: The Legacies of Gay Liberation is headed, “A dossier of gay liberation texts, manifestos and pictures from Australian Lesbian Gay Archives” and contains a representative sample of documents from the period that will help those who were not there or who were there but not involved understand what the gay lib movement meant to its followers. From my point of view, this section helps make this book a valuable artefact, that is, the artefacts it contains give it greater worth than it would have without them. Some of these documents are priceless examples of the brash confidence of the gay-lib generation. Many of these men and women believed that their consciousness-raising activities would re-shape the world, help remove oppressive practices and beliefs. And in one instance they did. While the coming-out stories of today’s cohort of young men and women might not be as publicly dramatic as were the coming-out experiences of the generation that initiated coming out, they were right to believe that the act itself was, is, and will always be a political one for as long as differences exist between non-homosexual people and queers. Among liberation documents (texts, manifestos and pictures) from the period that might whet the appetite of readers who were not there for whatever reason is an extract from Dennis Altman’s address at Sydney University in 1972; “Gay is good”, which Martha Kelley wrote in 1970 in New York, the opening line of which is: Look out straights! Here comes the Gay Liberation Front, springing up like warts all over the bland face of America … There’s also the “Radicalesbian manifesto” from some time around 1973; and the “effeminist manifesto” written in 1973. As mentioned, the documents capture some of the political colour and degree of urgency that were a feature of those times — when the USA and Australia were at war with Vietnam and conscripted soldiers from both countries and their allies were fighting peasant soldiers of the North Vietnamese People’s Liberation Army. Pictures from the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives include a poster from what has come to be known as the first Sydney Mardi Gras or as it was then described in the poster as the “Day of International Gay Solidarity”, 24 June 1978. The following extract from “Gay is good”, in which Altman addresses an imaginary heterosexual audience, says something about the sense of shame that his generation of gay men and lesbians carried with them and which the liberationists sought to help them shed: Understand this — that the worst part of being a homosexual is having to keep it secret. Not the occasional murders by police or queer-beaters; not the loss of jobs or expulsion from schools or dishonourable discharges — but the daily knowledge that what you are is something so awful that it cannot be revealed. But the internal violence of being made to carry — or choosing to carry — the load of your straight society’s unconscious guilt — this is what tears us apart; what makes us want to stand up in the offices, in the factories and schools and shout out our true identities. According to historian Graham Willett in his book Living Out Loud, Dennis Altman’s “Gay is good” proclamation at Sydney University in 1972 marked the beginning of gay liberation in Australia as a breakaway movement from its predecessor, the Campaign Against Moral Persecution (CAMP), which had been established in 1970–1. “Moving on” is the title of the book’s third and final section. It includes commentary mostly from the generations of activists and academics that followed Dennis Altman, such as Christos Tsiolkas, Robert Reynolds, Dean Spade, and Carlolyn D’Cruz. In his piece entitled, “My queer apprenticeship: between politics and friendship”, author Christos Tsolkias recalls a halcyon time when he read Homosexual, “that innocent moment of liberationist politics; on the eve of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>; on the cusp of the collapse of the communist project; just before the dawn of state-sanctioned equal opportunity” (italics in the original). Reading Tsiolkas here I am reminded of my own response to Homosexual. Like him, I was inspired by what Altman wrote in this final chapter where he argues, “for the civil and human rights of that subject of being and consciousness designated ‘homosexual’”. Like Tsiolkas, I was inspired but also surprised when in that final chapter Altman reckoned that the end of our separate, sexual identity was the best possible solution of homosexual persecution. Like a number of the other writers in this section of After Homosexual, Christos Tsiolkas struggles to understand the current interest in and energies devoted to parenthood and gay marriage: [R]eviled poofters and dykes got swallowed up and shat out the other end as the epitome of the cashed-up postmodern consumer. So all we want now is to get married, raise children and send them to the right private and/or experimental school where no one raises an eyebrow that Jonah has two mummies or Bridget has two dads. Robert Reynolds also finds it hard to understand why gays and lesbians born in the 1990s are so interested in gay marriage: I’m too much of a product of the 1980s to envisage getting married to a man (or a woman for that matter). Shall I be honest and confess that two men at the alter seems incongruous? Both men were actively involved in progressive social movements in their 20s and both seem to lament the conformist impulses let loose after more than 30 years of neo-liberalism. Another writer who did not belong to the baby-boomer generation, Carolyn D’Cruz writes that she picked up a copy of Homosexual on leaving a 1986 Marxist summer school and that sitting on her bookshelf together with copies of Monique Wittig’s The Lesbian Body and Pat Califa’s Sapphistries it: took part in the regular de-dyking of my household when real estate agents and parents were due to visit. On re-reading Homosexual, D’Cruz, whose chapter is entitled, “The (red) lion, the bitch and the wardrobe”, says she found charming Altman’s “description of seeing a man in chaps for the first time, and his curiosity about S&M codes in a leather bar in the 1970s”, admitting also that the man who was “this doyen of the gay liberation movement became one of my colleagues [at La Trobe University] and we very soon became friends”. This book, that includes many different queer voices, appeals for at least three reasons: first, as a record of a time long ago when, using Carolyn D’Cruz’s allegory, a young gay man from Tasmania stepped into a wardrobe, stumbled across a different world where things were better, then wrote about what he had found; second, as a record of documents and texts from that time; and third, as a record of how subsequent generations of LGBT people understood Homosexual, many of whom also developed friendships with its author. I suspect this book will enlighten and be an exciting read for people born in the 1990s and later and for those of all ages who were not aware of the rhetoric and underpinning philosophies of gay liberation in the 1970s and queer social movements that have been bubbling along in the four decades since then.

                                Less than welcoming... policies that prevent asylum seekers working are dehumanising.AAP Image/Newzulu/Zebedee Parkes My interview with Mr Syed did not get off to a great start. We’d arranged to meet at the Dandenong library – part of the city council building, a huge, bright orange edifice in the redeveloped heart of Dandenong in Melbourne’s southeast. I was early and kept a close watch on the library’s sliding doors as rain showers blew across the civic plaza outside. Various men who might conceivably have been asylum seekers from the subcontinent came and went but none of them proved to be Mr Syed. Just as I was about to call him, Mr Syed sent me a text. “I’m waiting at Dandenong library,” it read. “But it has moved from here and closed.” The new library, I belatedly discovered, had only just opened. Mr Syed was familiar with the old one, near the market where he does his shopping. I eventually found him about fifteen minutes later. I felt bad about a misunderstanding that had caused him to wait so long in the cold, but perhaps it made it a little easier for us to start talking. Rather than sit down immediately – two strangers across a table discussing painful and personal issues – we took advantage of a break in the weather to walk briskly back to the new library to retrieve the umbrella that I had left behind there. (It was only a $2-shop job and I might not have bothered, but Mr Syed insisted. It was a measure of our different circumstances.) We talked as we walked, Mr Syed sketching the broad outlines of his life in Australia so far – arrival by boat from Indonesia in October 2012, held in a Darwin detention centre for seventy days, released into the community on a Bridging Visa E. In some ways Mr Syed is lucky. He did not get sent to detention in Manus or Nauru. In other ways, he lucked out. Like other asylum seekers who reached Australia by sea after 13 August 2012, Mr Syed’s bridging visa denies him the right to work. By the time we meet he has spent almost eighteen months living on a government payment of about $221 per week – equivalent to 89% of the Centrelink Special Benefit. Using standard OECD measures, the Australian Council of Social Services calculates that the poverty line is $358 per week for a single adult. It says anything below this “equates to a very austere living standard”. After paying rent in a house shared with up to eight people, Mr Syed is left with less than $20 per day to cover all his other expenses. Somehow he manages to make the money stretch, to keep himself fed and clothed. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has found that some asylum seekers on bridging visas in Australia get by on one meal a day, and will go without food in order to buy phone credit so they can keep in touch with family overseas. Mr Syed can supplement his income with vouchers and donations from charities like the Salvation Army, he even manages to set aside some money to send home to his wife and children. Living below the poverty line is very difficult, but it is not his biggest concern. The more important issue for Mr Syed is that he is denied the right to contribute. He is a man with a strong work ethic and a strong sense of personal responsibility. The experience of being forced to do nothing and rely on handouts is eating away at his soul. “We feel ourselves like a beggar here,” he says. “This is a poison, really a poison for the life of a person.” No advantage The denial of work rights to asylum seekers living in the community was part of the Gillard government’s response to the 2012 Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers chaired by General Angus Houston – even though the panel’s report made no such recommendation. What the panel did recommend was ‘the application of a “no advantage” principle to ensure that no benefit is gained through circumventing regular migration arrangements.’ According to then Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, this “underlying principle” was “the most important recommendation of the Houston Expert Panel”. Preventing asylum seekers from working was, he said, “consistent” with the “no advantage” concept. Mr Syed is one of thousands of asylum seekers affected by this policy – although exact numbers are hard to come by. According to monthly reports on the Immigration department website, in April 2014 there were 24,273 asylum seekers living in the community on bridging visas. Consistent with the lack of transparency that has characterised the administration of Minister Scott Morrison, however, the department could not or would not tell me how many of them had work rights. The terse reply to my emailed inquiry was that the overall bridging visa statistics on the website were “all that is currently available”. Labor Senator Kim Carr had more success in getting data when he put a question at Senate Estimates in February 2014. At that time there were 19,353 asylum seekers living in the community without work rights. (Another 3000 or so asylum seekers live in community detention, confined to a particular, designated residence. They are not allowed to work either.) Most of them, like Mr Syed, have been in this situation for more than a year and there is no prospect of anything changing quickly given current policy settings and the immigration department’s processing backlog. As Curtin University researchers Lisa Hartley and Caroline Fleay comment in their February 2014 study Policy as Punishment: “It is likely that asylum seekers living in the community will face months if not several years without the right to work while they wait for their refugee claims to be finalised.’ At a rough estimate, and without accounting for administrative expenses, the cost of providing 89% of the Centrelink benefit to 19,000 asylum seekers runs to more than A$4 million per week. Even if only half of them managed to find jobs, granting these asylum seekers work rights could save taxpayers more than A$100 million per year. In addition, those who did find work would be contributing to government revenue by paying taxes and would become less frequent users of other government services, including Medicare. To deny the right to work is to deny a fundamental source of human dignity. Work contributes to a sense of self worth that is essential to well-being. It can be a vital coping mechanism, particularly for people who have suffered trauma and upheaval. That is one of the reasons why the right to work is enshrined in international treaties that Australia has ratified, including the Refugee Convention and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. To deny asylum seekers the right to work is to put their mental and physical health at risk. The human and financial costs of such a policy could be very great indeed. Mr Peter, Mr Syed Our conversation is polite, almost formal. He calls me Mr Peter. I call him Mr Syed, although he insists that I use his full name for this article and writes it down for me in an elegant cursive Syed Ejaz Hussain Zaidi. He is a dignified man, educated and softly spoken, but I sense that Mr Syed is under extreme pressure and at times he struggles to maintain his composure. As we sit drinking coffee he explains why he made the difficult decision to come to Australia, leaving behind his wife and five children, aged between four and eighteen. ‘I don’t know whether I did right or wrong,’ he worries. ‘Was it a correct decision or a silly mistake?’ Mr Syed is from Quetta, the capital of Pakistan’s Balochistan province that borders Iran and Afghanistan. He is a member of the minority Hazara community, Shia Muslims in a predominantly Sunni country. “I had a good life in my city,” he says. “I earned a good salary and had a small business on the side. I was such a successful person there.” Mr Syed worked in the regional office of a Pakistan government department. He was the only Hazara amongst the staff in his section. When five strangers came asking for him in August 2012, but refusing to say what they wanted, Mr Syed’s colleagues were alarmed. They rang him and warned him not to come to work. After receiving death threats by phone and text, Mr Syed went into hiding and then fled the country. I ask why he chose to seek haven in Australia, rather than some other place. “Because it was easier and cheaper than Europe,” he says. “At that time Australia was a leading country, welcoming refugees and giving them shelter. I was thinking about the future of my children and thinking about the future of my own life.” At that time too, record numbers of asylum seekers were reaching Australia by boat and the Gillard government was desperately casting around for ways to deter them. Mr Syed hopes his family can keep themselves relatively safe in Quetta secluded in the predominantly Hazara suburb where they live. To travel outside that enclave is to take a grave risk. This is consistent with independent reports on the situation in the city. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan says the city’s Hazaras “have retreated to just a couple of localities in Quetta to avoid being targeted”. Amnesty International says “routine targeted killings” are part of “a long line of brazen attacks against Quetta’s Shia population”. In two incidents in September 2012, shortly after Mr Syed stopped going to his office, men armed with rocket launchers and Kalashnikovs halted buses, hauled off all the Hazara men on board, and killed them. (Hazaras are generally easily identified by their East Asian appearance.) On at least two occasions, university buses carrying Hazara students to their studies have been targeted for bomb attacks. The Sunni extremist group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi often openly admits its role in the violence and has issued public warnings to Hazara Shias to leave Quetta or be killed: “It is our religious duty to kill all Shias, and to cleanse Pakistan of this impure nation… in all of Pakistan, especially Quetta, we will continue our successful jihad against the Shia Hazara and Pakistan will become a graveyard for them.” Despite such evidence, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi appears to operate with impunity. In January 2013 a double bombing in Quetta killed almost a hundred people, mostly Hazaras. In protest at authorities’ failure to protect them, the community refused to bury their dead. In sub-zero temperatures they staged athree-day sit-in beside the bodies of their loved ones. In the face of such atrocities, it is hardly surprising that Hazaras in Quetta might be drawn to the promises made by smugglers, or that the danger of trying to reach Australia by boat may seem like a risk worth taking. In 2010, a suicide bomber killed more than 70 people at a Shia Muslim rally in Quetta. In news photographs of the aftermath, a large billboard warning against travelling to Australia by boat is clearly visible in the background. A generous community A couple of years ago I worked on a research project mapping the spatial distribution of inequality in Australian cities over time. In our coloured maps of Melbourne, Dandenong consistently showed up us one of the darkest or lightest shaded areas, revealing high levels of disadvantage. At the 2011 Census, the unemployment rate was 3.3% higher than the national average and median household weekly incomes $281 lower. Dandenong had a higher than average proportion of single parent families and lower than average levels of educational achievement. Looking back across five census periods, the same patterns appeared. Disadvantage in Dandenong appears to be entrenched and persistent. On paper it is not the kind of place that you would expect to cope particularly well with an influx of thousands of asylum seekers who have no choice but to live in poverty and to rely on welfare and the goodwill of strangers because government rules have forced them into unemployment. Yet by and large, the local community has responded with generosity. There are thought to be around three thousand asylum seekers on bridging visas living in and around the Dandenong area. The largest groups are Hazaras from Afghanistan and Pakistan, Tamils from Sri Lanka, and Iranians, although there are many people from other backgrounds as well. “Considering the number of clients here, there have not been many issues,” one local service provider tells me. Perhaps it is because the people of Dandenong are not fazed by difference and know what it means to try to rebuild a life in a new land. According to the last census, fewer than four in ten Dandenong residents were born in Australia, compared to an average of close to seven in ten for the Australian population overall. More than 60% of households in Dandenong speak two or more languages at home, compared to only 20% nationally. The federal government funds organisations like AMES and the Red Cross to provide transitional services to asylum seekers on bridging visas after their release from detention, including initial accommodation assistance and a limited number of English language classes (usually three two-hour classes per week). The funding for these services runs out after six weeks, however, long before clients’ basic needs are met. While funding may be extended for asylum seekers who are assessed as particularly vulnerable (due to factors such as age, health or trauma), in reality agency case workers continue to offer support to all comers for as long as it is needed, which could be months or even years. Case workers stretch themselves to cover the gap in resources and call on volunteers to help out with such things as English tutoring or donations of essential goods like clothing or prams or fridges. AMES and the Red Cross also refer asylum seekers to local charities like the Salvation Army or the St Vincent de Paul Society and work with other community groups to develop free activities. Around Dandenong there are regular cricket or soccer matches, bicycle maintenance workshops, sewing groups, cooking classes, gym access and swimming lessons on offer to asylum seekers. I hear about one man – “a shy, normal Aussie bloke” – who takes two asylum seekers to a game at Docklands Stadium each week to introduce them to the delights of AFL. The work with asylum seekers in Dandenong goes well beyond the not-for-profit sector to involve local government, local businesses, the police and ordinary citizens. I’m told that local schools “bend over backwards” to help integrate the children of asylum seekers into classrooms; that the library is very welcoming; that real estate agents – often themselves of migrant or refugee background – can be very generous in finding rental accommodation, despite the fact that asylum seekers have no rental history and no credit history. In a relatively disadvantaged area like Dandenong, this puts additional strain on already scarce resources. Despite the best efforts of many local agencies and individuals, there are problems. In an assessment of the gaps in Australia’s protection system, the UNHCR found that asylum seekers in the community often struggle to find accommodation because they are seen as high risk: agents looking to set up long term lease agreements are reluctant to sign tenants on short term visas. Some landlords around Dandenong are exploiting the situation by crowding asylum seekers in together and charging rent per head, rather than rent for a property as a whole. Charging six people individual rents can double the return on a three-bedroom house that would normally let at $300 per week. Asylum seekers on bridging visas are competing for a limited range of houses at the lower end of the rental market. In a report on its emergency relief program, Uniting Care notes that asylum seekers often end up in low-quality accommodation with inefficient heating and hot water systems and poorly maintained plumbing. As a result, they can find themselves in financial difficulties when they are hit with unexpectedly high water and electricity bills. The UNHCR also reports of asylum seekers working, despite the restriction on their visas, and getting exploited as a result of their vulnerability: ‘not being paid, working long hours for a meager wage and having no recourse to remedy these experiences due to fear of being found out.’ Local community workers know this kind of exploitation goes on in Dandenong, but as one person put it to me, “there is stuff-all we can do about it or will do about it.” As another said, “you can’t tell someone to quit a job paying $10 an hour.” To report the situation would be to put asylum seekers at risk of being sent back to detention, potentially on Nauru or Manus, for working in breach of their visa conditions. A job, even a badly paid job, not only helps asylum seekers put food on the table and pay the rent, it also keeps them occupied, gives them something to do, helps them to stop thinking. Overall though, the view I hear repeatedly in Dandenong is that the community response to asylum seekers has been remarkable. As the resident of a more affluent part of Melbourne, Rosa Misitano admits that she had some stereotypical views of Dandenong before she came to work in the suburb. Now she holds the area in very high regard. “It is very, very welcoming,” she says. “I often get to see the nice side of humanity.” Six years ago, dissatisfied with her career in the mining industry, Misitano went back to study, completing a Masters of Education and a Graduate Certificate to qualify as a careers adviser. In the process of retraining she discovered volunteering and an absolute passion to help others to be their best. “I can use my business experience to do that,” she says. Misitano has been the manager of the Dandenong branch of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre since it opened in September 2013. The Centre operates from Monday to Wednesday out of a two-storey shopfront on the main street and is financed entirely by donations. A team of 35 volunteers provide employment services and eighteen two-hour English language classes per week. When I visit in mid April, the teacher of the more advanced group is sharing a recipe for Anzac biscuits. The Centre has considerable success in finding jobs for those asylum seekers who do have work rights, despite their diverse backgrounds. “We’ve had prawn farmers, archaeologists, metallurgists and teachers,” says Misitano. The Centre helps asylum seekers with basic skills, including CV writing; provides some occupational health and safety training and offers instruction on Australian workplace culture, such as advice about making eye contact, or about how to respond to an invitation to Friday night drinks if you do not drink alcohol. Expectations on the participants are high. “We’re tough,” says Misitano. “They have to apply for 20 jobs per week. They have to get into the habits that they will need in the workforce.” The Centre has helped asylum seekers get jobs at many different businesses including a fertiliser factory, a rose farm and a Toyota dealership. Misitano sees how work can change lives. She tells the story of a young Afghan asylum seeker who insisted on treating her to coffee and cake after getting his first pay. The young man had been distraught when he first came to the Centre, because he felt that he had to lie about his circumstances when he spoke to his mother on the phone. Now, for the first time in months, he was comfortable calling home, because he knew would soon be able to send money back to his family. Misitano is upset, however, that she can’t do more to ease the distress of asylum seekers without work rights. “They come to me and say: I need something to do. It gets dark. It gets me sad,” she says. Staff I speak to at other community services in Dandenong echo this view. (Some prefer not to give their names because they work for organisations in receipt of government funding.) “They’re in limbo, they can’t move on in life,” says one. “It’s a mental health issue and their physical health deteriorates as a result. Over time we’re seeing many more incidents of self harming.” “Would granting work rights make a difference?” I ask. “It would make a massive difference,” comes the answer. Evidence gathered by the UNHCR reveals that many asylum seekers find it “shameful and demoralising” to rely on handouts rather than working. Denial of work rights prevents them having meaningful engagement with the community and adds to a sense of hopelessness and social isolation. The prolonged lack of purpose can be “devastating for drive, meaning, purpose and mental health”. Roslyn Leary is the local manager of the Victorian Foundation for Survivors of Torture – more commonly known as Foundation House – which provides support to people who have been subjected to torture and trauma. In the current circumstances, she says, the agency has had to re-think the way it works with asylum seekers. “The basis of trauma work is that a person has to feel safe,” she says. “With asylum seekers who fear deportation, who fear being put back into detention, who cannot work and establish a new life, the principles of trauma work have been pulled out from under us.” Leary describes much of the work with asylum seekers as “symptom reduction” – attempting to alleviate high levels of anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. “Sometimes it feels as if we have had another good day at work because nobody has killed themselves,” she says. Leary has spent time on the frontline of the global refugee crisis, working as a refugee determination officer with the UNHCR in Egypt, deciding about who will and who will not be granted the agency’s protection. Despite the much greater resources and support available to asylum seekers in Australia, in some respects, she says – particularly the denial of work rights – the situation for them here is worse. “In Egypt, asylum seekers were not supposed to work either,” she says. “But there is a big black market economy. Many could at least find some sort of job and feel like they are functioning as a human being. That <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span> people’s sense of dignity.” Here the lack of meaningful activity means “endless days, boredom, frustration and anger”. Many asylum seekers have already spent a long time in transit countries or in detention centres. With nothing to do, they can’t help but think about those wasted years. “It has an extremely damaging impact on people’s sense of self,” says Leary. ‘We are in depression’ When I ask Mr Syed how he spends his days, he replies, “I am walking around the streets like a mad person. We have no access to the social benefit of life. We do not have anything to do. We are in depression.” For a brief period, Mr Syed volunteered gift-wrapping Christmas presents at Myer, with customers donating money to charity in return for the service. About 50 asylum seekers took part in a project that raised almost $70,000 for Vision Australia. Mr Syed says it helped to be busy. “It has a good psychological effect on you.” Asylum seekers show great interest in volunteering and in April 2014 an audit by AMES concluded that as many as four hundred asylum seekers in Melbourne had volunteered in some capacity in the previous 12 months. Organising such opportunities is far from straightforward, however. Language can be a barrier, as can police checks or working with children certificates. And the federal government has put strict but opaque rules in place, limiting volunteering to not-for-profit or local government organisations that already have a volunteer program and to activities that will “benefit the community”. Asylum seekers are not to receive any cash or in kind benefits in return for their time and cannot be engaged in any activity that might “otherwise be undertaken in return for wages by Australian resident”. Nor can asylum seekers study – unless of course they can afford the full, up-front fees that are charged to international students. “We are keen to work,” says Mr Syed. “We want to be part of the society. We want to contribute our services. We don’t want to be a burden.” He is completely mystified as to why the government would give him money and refuse to let him pay his own way. “Why are they doing this?” he asks me. I explain about the perception that asylum seekers are economic migrants rather than refugees, drawn to Australia by the attraction of better jobs at higher wages. “I did not come here for financial benefit,” he insists. “I came here to get a secure life for my family.” I say that perhaps there is another reason too, that the government is probably hoping that Mr Syed and other asylum seekers will give up and go home. Roslyn Leary from Foundation House puts it this way: “The message from the government is very clear: because you came ‘illegally’ you cannot participate in any way in our community. The overall intention is to drive people out, to get them to give up and go home.” Leary says some people are returning: “People who feel they have to go back to see family, even if they die.” Returning to Quetta is an option that must have crossed Mr Syed’s mind: “I can’t tell you how my children are getting upset mentally. Every time I speak to them on Skype they ask me ‘when will we be with you?’ What should I answer? I can only say, it is only God who knows. I am reaching the stage when I cannot face my family any more.” After more than eighteen months in Australia, immigration department officials have not yet interviewed Mr Syed about his application for a protection visa. His original six-month bridging visa expired long ago and has not yet been renewed, rendering him technically unlawful. According to information provided to Senate Estimates, in February 2014 Mr Syed was one of almost 12,000 asylum seekers in the community whose bridging visas had “ceased”. For some (though not Mr Syed) this has created serious difficulties in accessing health services, because without a valid visa they were unable to renew their Medicare cards. The department had suspended bridging visa renewals “pending finalisation of legislative and administrative arrangements” for Minister Scott Morrison’s Code of Behaviour. Now the code is in place, asylum seekers must undertake not to “engage in any antisocial or disruptive activities that are inconsiderate, disrespectful or threaten the peaceful enjoyment of other members of the community” in order to renew their visa. The Minister insists that the code is necessary to “protect” the Australian community. Asylum seekers who breach it risk detention on Manus or Nauru. When Mr Syed does eventually get to argue his case for protection, he may have to do so without professional advice because the federal government has withdrawn funding for legal assistance for asylum seekers. Mr Syed knows that if he is recognised as a refugee, he is only likely to be granted a three-year “humanitarian concern” visa, a reincarnation of the temporary protection visas introduced by John Howard. The Senate has twice disallowed the reintroduction of temporary protection visas, but the Immigration Minister is determined to bring them back. If Mr Syed were to go home to Quetta, despite the risks he faces there, the government would mark him down as a voluntary return. In reality, he would have been forced into that decision by the denial of any other option. “I would prefer to live in hell with my family than to live in heaven without them,” he says. “I do not want to die alone. I want to die with my family.” Mr Syed puts his head in his hands. Rubs his eyes. I look away and stare through the window at the rain outside. Recently I witnessed Julie Bishop giving a leadership talk to a group of undergraduates. When one of the students asked what was the biggest challenge facing the world today, the Foreign Minister nominated “constraints on freedom” and “the movement away from democracy” in many parts of the world. She gave the example of Syria as a place where people lack freedom of choice, freedom of speech and the freedom to make decisions for themselves. It was not my place to ask a question at the gathering but I was silently hoping the students would ask about many of the asylum seekers locked up on Manus or Nauru or Christmas Island: individuals, who, denied freedom in Syria or other similarly troubled places, had exercised what little choice was available to them to seek a better life for themselves and their families. When the Minister went on to say that she had joined the Liberal Party because it champions self-reliance, reward for effort and hard work, my thoughts turned immediately to Mr Syed, a man who desperately desires to be self-reliant but is denied the right to be so; a man who would work hard at any job, no matter if the reward for his effort was small; a man who came to Australia to try to free his family from the kind of persecution that Julie Bishop abhors. None of the students asked about the treatment of asylum seekers. If they had, she would no doubt have defended government policy on the basis of preventing the horror of deaths at sea, or by trumping the individual rights she had just championed with another set of rights, based on sovereignty and the democratically expressed desire of the Australian people for the government to control our borders. Even if we grant the point that there are conflicting sets of ethical concerns at play in the asylum seeker issue, even if we were to go so far as to acknowledge that there may have been a case for using deterrence to “stop the boats” to save lives at sea, the soul-destroying treatment of Mr Syed and other asylum seekers and refugees can no longer be justified. No asylum seekers have made it to Australia by sea since December 2013. The Abbott government’s strategy of naval interception and of forcing people back to Indonesia in unsinkable, nausea-inducing orange lifeboats has proved to be an effective blockade. As long as the smugglers cannot reach Australia, they have no service to sell to asylum seekers in Indonesia. As Robert Manne has argued, this gives us an opportunity to help ‘save the lives of the tens of thousands of asylum seekers’ who are already Australia’s responsibility. There is no longer any reason to ‘send a message’ to potential boat people waiting in Indonesia or elsewhere by denying work rights or family reunion to people who arrived before that naval barrier was put in place. There is no point in extending the suffering of those detained in Manus or Nauru or Christmas Island. Regardless of whether or not it was ever morally justifiable to damage the wellbeing of one group of asylum seekers in order to deter another group from making a similar journey – to use people as means, rather than treat them as ends – there is no longer any point to such punishment. It is just unconscionable cruelty. Peter Mare’s essay will be published in Griffith REVIEW: The Way We Work, available from August.

                                From the late 1990s, the world galvanised in support of dramatic increases in funding for the distribution of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatments to all who needed them.World national flags/Shuttershock When <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> first emerged in the early 1980s, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection was a death sentence. But a global effort has ensured this is no longer the case for a growing number of people. The good news today is that the annual number of new global infections continues to fall – from the high point of some 3.4 million in 2001 to 2.3 million in 2012. And, as fewer people contract <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, and more of those who do are given life-saving treatments, fewer progress to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>. In 2005, some 2.3 million people died from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, but this number had declined to 1.6 million in 2012. These figures indicate how far we have come in the long journey from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. Early efforts and innovation Countries such as Australia that moved decisively to introduce effective <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> prevention policies in the mid-1980s generally saw a rapid falling away in numbers of new <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infections. But in most of the world, for a range of social, political and religious reasons, effective prevention measures were either not introduced or not implemented on a large enough scale to make a difference. And it soon became clear that if the developing world were to survive the epidemic, new treatments would have to be provided at a scale and with a level of certainty that was unprecedented in the annals of global public health. What was missing was the funding required to translate the potential of widespread access to treatments into tangible reality on the ground. From the late 1990s, the world galvanised in support of dramatic increases in funding for the distribution of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatments to all who required them. Former US president Bill Clinton successfully pressed major pharmaceutical companies to greatly reduce the unit costs of new <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatments in the developing world. And thanks to the leadership of president George W Bush, the United States Congress appropriated $US50 billion for the President’s Emergency Plan for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> Relief (PEPFAR). In 2002, an innovative new financial mechanism, the Global Fund to Fight <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, Tuberculosis and Malaria was created to raise and channel new funding to countries wishing to increase access to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatments. It has raised over $US30 billion to fight against the three diseases, and about half of this has funded access to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatments in some 150 countries. At the 2013 Global Fund replenishment conference in Washington DC, convened by President Barack Obama, governments, philanthropic, faith-based and private sector donors pledged over $US12 billion for the period 2014-16, a 30% increase over a similar 2010 effort. Over nine million people worldwide now have access to life-saving <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatments, thanks to these two initiatives. Changing direction Taken together, this vast mobilisation of all kinds of human and material resources has utterly transformed the trajectory of the global <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> epidemic. If they are on treatments, people who would once have died from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> are now living well with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>; the number of children being born with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> is falling dramatically; and above all, many millions of people who once would have surely acquired <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, have not. The world is now more than halfway along the path from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, but none of these great achievements would have been possible without sustained funding commitments, stretching out over years and decades. And in 2014, there is still much more to do. Even though annual <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> funding from developed to developing countries is running at about $US18 billion, this is still about $US5 billion a year short of what’s required to sustain the gains of the last decade. And there are many millions of people who are still without access to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatments. To consolidate our gains, and to drive new <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection rates down still further, billions of new dollars will be needed. But the required resources are not just going to come from the same old donors in the same old ways; we must develop innovative and imaginative new methods of securing critical funding. The international response to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> has always been a hotbed of radical policy innovation and implementation – from the bold prevention initiatives undertaken in Australia to the creation of the Global Fund itself. By following the right strategies, backed by adequate funding, the world is closer towards the end of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> than at any time in the last three decades. Now is not the time to relent. The work of the Pacific Friends of the Global Fund to Fight <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, Tuberculosis and Malaria is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Judging by this video SpaceX has managed to land the first stage rocket booster nicely on the ocean after their Orbcomm launch on July 14th. It seems we're one step closer to a landing on dry land. Both this and the previous landing seem to have gone well. Hopefully the next landing test camera has something to deice the camera lens. <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                Flying is not an easy job, and neither is science.EPA, CC BY Oliver Smithies won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2007 “for discoveries of principles for introducing specific gene modifications in mice by the use of embryonic <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>”. Mohit Kumar Jolly, researcher at the University of Rice and contributor to The Conversation, interviewed him at the 2014 Lindau Nobel Laureates Meeting. Where do you think good ideas come from? I fly a glider, and I turn off the engine at some altitude, and then the glider needs upwards thrust to maintain itself. I often spot a hawk then, and start to fly in the direction it is flying, because it [the hawk] is also looking for the upward thrust, so if I follow it, I’ll also get the thrust. So my flying experience also makes me think. I still go to the lab every day, even on weekends. Very often ideas for research comes from our experiences or memories – it takes only one moment for the idea to occur, but it takes a lifetime sometimes to show that it works. You have been in science for a very long time. How, in your opinion, has the culture of science changed over time? Not much actually. Scientists then as well as now want to be known as “the first one to do something”. When Galileo discovered Jupiter’s moon, he was worried about the same, and even today, scientists are afraid of the same [not being first]. But hasn’t this intense competition caused scientific misconduct increase significantly today? Yes, but it must be understood that scientists are not different from other communities – of course, you’ll find many dishonest scientists. Do you agree that more dialogue between science and the public is needed to ensure the trust people have in science? That is very much required. I haven’t done as much in this aspect as I should have done, but I’d like to share an anecdote. When we were doing experiments on cloning genes, the community in Cambridge, Massachusetts revolted against our plan, due to various fears associated with cloning. But, in Wisconsin, we invited the media and explained to them in detail what exact experiments we were planning, and also listening to their misinformed fears and clarifying them – they finally allowed us happily to do those experiments. What is your opinion of fellow Nobel Laureate Randy Schekman’s attack on the three big science journals – Science, Nature, Cell? I believe that what matters more is not where you publish, but what you publish. A good scientist is a global citizen, and I support open access and sharing of ideas. What message would you give to young scientists? Find something that you enjoy doing, and then pursue it. It need not be science, but must be something that excites you.

                                Evidence based medicine A recent paper in the British Medical Journal suggests that evidence-based medicine is in crisis. Evidence-based medicine is based on the practice of employing treatments that have scientific research that backs up their effectiveness. It is usually set against medical practice that is based on anecdotal experience or simply doing things because that is the way they always have been done. Ways evidence-based medicine is broken The authors of the paper point out however that there are a number of problems with evidence-based medicine that together, significantly compromise its effectiveness. The first problem is that evidence-based medicine plays right into the hands of companies and organisations with a vested interest in seeing a treatment recommended. Of particular concern are drugs that are recommended for treating pre-diseases. The classic example of this is the use of statins to lower cholesterol in the attempt of reducing cardiovascular disease. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has offered evidence-based guidance on prescribing statins that has reduced the required level of risk before treatment is offered, effectively increasing the number of people taking statins significantly. The bar for being put on statins is very low and cholesterol levels can be considered normal and the person could still have a risk profile that puts them on the pathway for treatment. Drug companies have a vested interest in funding trials and journals are more likely to publish positive results than negative ones. The authors of the BMJ paper cite “one review of industry sponsored trials of antidepressants showed that 37 of 38 with positive findings, but only 14 of 36 with negative findings, were published”. Another major problem with evidence-based medicine is the fact that statistical significance in a clinical trial does not necessarily mean very much at an individual level. This works to overemphasise benefits and to underestimate risks. People writing the guidelines to implement evidence-based medicine face a growing challenge of dealing with ever increasing amounts of evidence. At the end of this are the clinicians that have to deal with an explosion in the guidelines themselves which can be complicated and even more so when they have to be applied to a patient with all of the real-life complexity and idiosyncrasies that they bring. The authors are not suggesting abandoning evidence as the basis for clinical treatment. What they end up recommending are modifications of how the evidence is gathered, reported and implemented. Technology and data as a solution What the authors don’t mention though is the role that technology has to play in providing a solution for the problems that they have outlined. The first element of a technology-based solution actually runs counter to the author’s point of crisis. What is needed is more evidence and data, not less. Large data sets providing detailed monitoring of patients combined with genetic information will eventually be able to reveal specific information about what makes a treatment work in one patient and not another. This type of information goes much further than the limited range of measures normally collected as part of current clinical trials. To enable this collection of data, we will need to be monitoring people pervasively and collecting that information on a continuous basis. Clinical analytics of this so-called “clinical <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” can potentially reveal much more information about the effectiveness of particular drugs and treatments given a specific individual with a set of symptoms and illnesses. What we will then need is sophisticated artificial intelligence as portrayed in the fictional film “Her” that guides clinicians through a range of true evidence-based treatment options that have been personalised for the specific patient at that moment in time. It is possible that as a society we are not ready to trust the likes of Google CEO Larry Page with the task of collecting and analysing patient data on this massive a scale. He declared our ability to save thousands of lives through this approach. Despite our reticence, it is clear that he is right. Companies such as PatientsLikeMe have also faced skepticism when arguing their ability to contribute to clinical research through the massive, but self-reported data they collect from patients. Despite the resistance, sites like PatientsLikeMe, CureTogether and the personalised genetic profiling company 23andMe are part of the future of medicine. These companies have the ability of providing extensive information about the effectiveness of treatments, symptoms and side effects of people outside of the restrictions, and some would say artificial settings, of a clinical trial. All of this does not deny the needs for the skills of a doctor, at least until the technology has advanced to the point where it makes those skills redundant.

The background: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> works by attaching itself to specific cells — T-cells or CD4 cells — that allow it to replicate itself and spread throughout the body. The virus integrates itself into those cells, writing itself into an infected person's genome. While antiretroviral drugs can hold off the process, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> is still integrated into those cells.

This year, the biennial meeting—the biggest global gathering of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> scientists, health-care workers, and activists—has made stigma and discrimination one of its main concerns.

Worldwide, discriminatory environments that fuel <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> epidemics have remained entrenched in some countries and resurged in others.

                                Until recently, no-one dared to discuss a cure when it came to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. There had been a general consensus among experts that the best we would ever achieve would be durable control of the infection with antiretroviral therapy (ART). And, in this regard, we have been tremendously successful. ART is often given as only one tablet a day with minimal toxicity, leads to normal life expectancy, and reduces viral transmission. But therapy clearly has its limitations. It must be administered daily for life, remains expensive for the most affected countries in the world, and is not completely benign in terms of short-term and long-term toxic effects.

An estimated 9·7 million people in low-income and middle-income countries had started antiretroviral therapy by 2012. New insights into the mechanisms of latent infection and the importance of reservoirs of infection might eventually lead to a cure.

Now is the time to replace the quest for so-called silver bullets with a public health approach to combination prevention that understands that risk is not evenly distributed and that effective interventions can vary by risk profile. Different countries have different microepidemics, with very different levels of transmission and risk groups, changing over time.

                                JUDGING from the condemnation, Facebook just “friended” Satan. The company has been pilloried for academic research it published, showing that by adjusting its users’ news feeds so that a greater proportion of positive or negative items appeared, it could nudge people to post slightly sunnier or gloomier items themselves. For sociologists, the study provided evidence of “social contagion”—the spread of ideas and moods through imitation and conformity—without face-to-face contact.That Facebook runs similar tests all the time for commercial reasons—to get users to linger longer, or to click on ads—was largely lost on the critics. And the most telling bit went unnoticed: the difference in posting behaviour was between 0.04% and 0.1%. It sounds paltry, and is. But to Facebook’s data scientists, it amounted to a smashing victory. “Given the massive scale,” they noted, “even small effects can have large aggregated consequences.”This may indeed be the unspoken secret of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>.

                                THE star of the show was missing from the skies above the Farnborough air show, Europe’s biggest aerospace get-together, which began on July 14th. The F-35 fighter (pictured), which was to have made its first appearance outside America, is grounded after an engine fire. Not taking to the air when expected is a trait of Lockheed Martin’s jet. It is years behind schedule and stratospherically over budget. Its absence is an embarrassment for Lockheed but, then again, its presence might have reminded the defence officials shopping for kit at Farnborough of just the sort of complex and expensive programme that they want to avoid signing up to in future.Arms-makers are going through a lean period. Some big contracts, such as ones to make bombers, trainer aircraft and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, are still up for grabs in America, the world’s biggest spender. But it and other rich-world governments, struggling to curb their deficits, are trying ever harder to get the most bang for the fewest bucks. The revenues of 17 of the top 20 American weapons-makers shrank in 2013. American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had helped to push global spending to a record $1.7 trillion in 2008. Since then...

                                FOR years the BRICS countries have insisted they are more than an acronym. To dispel any lingering doubts, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, who gathered in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza for their sixth annual summit on July 15th, announced the creation of two financial institutions: the New Development Bank (NDB) to finance infrastructure and “sustainable development” projects, with $50 billion in capital to start with, and the $100 billion Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), to tide over members in financial difficulties.On the surface, the NDB and the CRA, which must still be approved by the five countries’ parliaments, look like upstart rivals to the World Bank and the IMF, together the cornerstone of the post-war economic order. The BRICS complain that the Bretton Woods outfits, named after a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> town where they were conceived 70 years ago this month, give the developing world short shrift.

America and Europe have proved shamefully slow to redress the imbalance.Recipients of IMF cash also resent the tough reforms on which help is conditional, not to mention the lecturing tone in which they are dictated.
