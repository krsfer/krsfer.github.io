                                Almost a century ago, as war raged in Flanders, Britain took the fateful decision to carve up the Ottoman empire. It wanted to stop Russia and others from gaining influence over Islam that could be used to inflame Muslims in British possessions from Egypt to India. Working with France, Britain set up monarchies and protectorates, forging nations out of the tribes and sects that littered the Ottoman provinces. After independence this imperial construction continued to be imposed by despots and dictators. Today it is falling apart (see page 55). At its heart, in Iraq, a Sunni rebellion is boiling. In the past ten days the jihadists of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) in league with large numbers of ex-Baathists and Sunni militias have taken the second city, Mosul, and swarmed to within striking distance of the capital. Shia-dominated Baghdad is unlikely to fall, but a stand-off beckons in which large parts of Iraq remain in rebel hands and the Kurdish north drifts towards independence. At the same time, Syria is engulfed by civil war, split between a western part under Bashar Assad and an eastern jumble of fiefs and territories under the Kurds and rival Sunni militias. Earlier this month ISIS took a symbolic step towards creating a new Islamic state by bulldozing a berm on the line drawn by French and British diplomats to divide Syria from Iraq all those years ago. For the outside world the litany of beheadings, massacres and sectarian hatred raises two questions. Is the old order salvageable in Iraq and Syria? And, if so, is it worth saving? Tribes With Black Flags  Across the Middle East, post-imperial despotism has collided with a religious rejection of modernity and an angry youth bereft of opportunities. In Iraq the conflict is especially poisonous because of the invasion in 2003--a fact that its architects, including Britain’s former prime minister, Tony Blair, do themselves no service by denying. The invasion was supposed to replace a dictatorship with a resilient democracy. Instead it implanted al-Qaeda and its foreign jihadists, brutalized the people with years of suicide-bombings, sectarian hatred and insurgency, and paralyzed the West’s will to intervene constructively even when there are strong arguments to do so. What is more, Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister who eventually emerged, has governed Iraq disastrously. Fearful of a Sunni resurgence and of challenges to his own power, he strangled the institutions of Iraqi democracy in the cradle. Competent army officers were a threat, so he replaced them. Low-level Sunni resistance helped unite his own Shia community behind him, so he repressed Sunnis and excluded them from government. Corruption yielded funds to buy off opponents and reward cronies, so graft flourished. Many people will now calculate that they can profit from the Sunni rebellion. Iraq’s Kurds have seized full control of disputed, oil-rich Kirkuk. Mr Assad can revel in the seeming proof that the people he is fighting in Syria are both monstrously cruel and the sworn enemies of the West. Iran, which craves regional influence, is needed more than ever by Mr Maliki, a resentful fellow Shia, and it hopes that America may call on it to help repel ISIS. The Arab monarchies wish that Sunni rebels might bleed their rival, Iran, which is short of money and already fighting alongside Mr Assad in Syria. Even Mr Maliki might fancy his chances of tightening his grip on Iraq’s Shia majority--and eventually taking back most of his country. The one thing that favours Iraq remaining intact is that ISIS’s brand of fanatical Islam and its mission to export jihad threaten everybody. Crucially, that includes the Sunni rebels. Today ISIS conveniently offers them deliverance from Mr Maliki; tomorrow it threatens to impose its own brutal version of Islamic rule. Sunni militias are already fighting ISIS in Syria. Sunni Iraqis fought against its al-Qaeda forerunner once before, during the Sahwa, or Awakening, in 2007-08, thanks to American money and the promise of a stake in the new Iraq. They are allies of ISIS today because that promise was not honoured. For Iraq to remain in one piece the Sunnis must be persuaded to try again, under the assurance that this time Iraq really will be a federal state in which power is shared in Baghdad and institutions like the army regain their national character. The sectarian Mr Maliki is not the man to win the Sunnis over. Ideally his Iranian backers would force him to give way to a new prime minister. Similarly the Arab monarchies might lean on Iraqi Sunnis to reject ISIS, and the Turks might make clear to the Kurds that they should not rush towards independence, but also give federalism a chance. America can help with the Kurds, but its role should chiefly be to knock diplomatic heads together so as to prise Iraqi Sunnis from ISIS by encouraging a temporary convergence of regional interests. America should be in no hurry to deploy aircraft and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>--for fear of widening the very sectarian divide that it wants to narrow. The time for military action may come later, if Baghdad is imperilled or ISIS threatens to spread global terror from its jihadist camps. As part of the campaign against ISIS, America should accelerate and augment its policy of training and arming more moderate Syrian forces. That would, incidentally, strengthen the rebellion against Mr Assad, who has all along cynically fomented jihadism in order to make himself appear the lesser of two evils. Worth Fighting For Winning over Iraqi Sunnis and corralling regional rivals will not be easy. But it is worth trying. The Middle East’s imperial boundaries are flawed--but so is every other plausible set of lines. The break-up of the Balkans showed how much blood is spilled when people redraw their borders using force. In Iraq and Syria the process could take years--and would feed sectarianism and global terrorism. It might spread to other countries, such as Lebanon and Jordan, created by the same imperial geographers. And when at last peace comes, it will inevitably require an acceptance that people have more to gain from accommodation than from shutting each other out. Better on balance to aim for that now, within today’s flawed borders, than to sit back and watch Iraq go up in flames.

                                If you are a parent, Google wants to know. And, apparently, it can figure that out on its own and report your child-rearing status to its advertisers, according to Larry Kim founder and CTO of WordStream. Google just added a "parental status" tab to its AdWords dashboard, allowing advertisers to use that as a criteria for ad campaigns, a WordStream data scientist has discovered. WordStream helps businesses manage their Google advertising campaigns, so it watches for every change that Google makes. WordStream noticed that the parental status option went live to some advertisers late last week. Advertisers can choose between three settings "“Parent”, “Not a parent” and “Unknown." This tab joins other demographic choices Google offers such as age and gender. Kim speculates that this is just the beginning: This isn't just a great way for advertisers to reach increasingly granular audiences with their advertisements, it’s also a glimpse into the possibilities of what Google could offer advertisers in the future. They've already supported targeting by Age, Gender, Interests, and now Parental Status. Could we eventually see demographic subsets based on race? Sexual orientation? The more data advertisers have the better (for them), but is Google going too far? This situation brings to mind a recent social experiment done by Janet Vertesi, assistant professor of sociology at Princeton University. She wanted to hide the fact that she was pregnant from Google, Facebook and other <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> Internet companies. She had to go to great lengths to do it such as searching for pregnancy and baby care information only using an anonymous browser (Tor), routing the baby items bought on Amazon to a rented post office box, making no mention of her pregnancy on Facebook, and so on. Knowing that a woman is pregnant (let alone a parent) is a marketing gold mine. A pregnant woman’s marketing data is worth 15 times as much as the average person’s, she said. But to hide her prenatal status from the Internet took extreme commitment, carefully watching every detail of what she and her husband did online for months. Most of us wouldn't be able to keep that up for years of parenthood. Plus, we'd like to share photos of our kids now and then, not hide them. And that's, of course, why Google knows. Here's the photo that Kim shared showing the new "parental status" in Google AdWords.   Join the conversation about this story »

                                Reuters reports that a SpaceX launch planned for Friday from Cape Canaveral has been scrubbed, though it may be rescheduled for as early as Saturday evening. The Falcon 9 will be lifting six communications satellites for Orbcomm intended to facilitate machine-to-machine communications. According to another report, It was not immediately clear if the problem was with equipment on the rocket or with ground systems connected to the rocket at Launch Complex 40. The mission was delayed from May by a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helium">helium</a></span> leak on the rocket, but it was not known if the same issue was a factor Friday. Launch managers pushed the targeted liftoff from the window's opening at 6:08 p.m. to its end at 7:01 p.m., but ran out of time to resolve the problem. The countdown was halted with under eight minutes to go. <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                If you follow my standard Twitter account, @LaurenInSpace, you’re missing out on the good stuff. @LaurenInEbooks is a computer-generated stream of garbled tweets that are often far more on point than what I actually have to say.  China is a wearable. Ramona the Love Terrier reports: — Otaku Journalist ebx (@LaurenInEbooks) May 23, 2014 A friend of mine, who knows about my love of esoteric Internet phenomena, built @LaurenInEbooks as a gift. It’s inspired by @horse_ebooks, a Twitter account so famous for its poorly computer-generated tweets that it got profiled in the New Yorker, which revealed that it had gone from a weird spam effort to sell ebooks into a mysterious art project. Horse_ebooks is an old joke by now. But it’s not too late for you to get in on this bizarre genre of word art. A computer-generated account which serves as your own personal Twitter bot Frankenstein is always fresh and funny. Plus, for beginning coders like me, this project is a great way to dip your toe into Python and Ruby while sharpening your Git skills—and at the end, get a hilarious little bot for your troubles.  See also: GitHub For Beginners: Don't Get Scared, Get Started Some of my coworkers wanted in join in on the fun, so I decided to build them some Twitter bots, too. However, I found the starter script I chose to use, Heroku Ebooks, significantly difficult to follow. Building on top of it, I decided to create a tutorial anybody can use. A caveat: I built this tutorial on a Mac using its Terminal app, software which provides direct access to running software programs. I have not tested this tutorial for Windows machines, but if you need help, start with GitHub’s Windows instructions.  It took me three tries to perfect the process. By the third time, building a bot took me only 20 minutes to complete! Here’s how to easily build your own random Twitter bot—and learn a little code at your friends’ expense.   Set Up A Twitter Account You’re going to need a place for these tweets to go, so build a new Twitter account with a funny name. If you add “ebooks” to the end, @horse_ebooks fans will instantly get the reference, but you can choose any variation you like. In order to verify the account, you’ll need an email address that isn’t already being used by Twitter, so I’d suggest a secondary email you rarely use. I just generated a new email address I’ll probably never check again over at my hosting service, Bluehost, but you can also sign up for a new one on Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or Outlook.com. This new Twitter account also MUST have a mobile number connected to it. I used Google Voice, since they give you your first number for free. If I needed another I might have used Twilio, which also gives you your first number for free. If you need to create a lot of accounts, Twilio will cost $1/month, which can add up fast. And I should also note that while Twitter allows you to create parody accounts, “mass account creation” is against the rules. Twitter also has rules on automated accounts which you should follow. So don’t go crazy with your bots.  This is also a good time to make a profile image. For @SelenaEbooks, I inverted the colors on her face to make a bizarro version of her Twitter image. I'm sure she just loves it. Set Up A Twitter Developer Account  While still logged into your new Twitter account, navigate over to dev.twitter.com. The first thing you want to do is create a new app. For convenience, use the same name as your new account. Once you’ve named and created your app, you’re going to immediately want to adjust its permissions to “Read and Write.” In order to post to Twitter from a program, it needs to have a mobile number connected to the account—which is why we needed to create one earlier.   Next, go to the API Keys page and click “Generate my Access Token,” and keep the window open while it works. You’ll need those keys and tokens in just a few minutes.  Clone The GitHub Repository Whenever you are working on a coding project, you are always standing on the shoulders of giants. In this case, we’re borrowing an open source Ruby and Python script that GitHub user Tom Meagher has saved in a repository.  You need a copy of Tom’s repository on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to hit “Clone In Desktop” or “Download Zip.” Either way, you want to take the resulting folder, which will be called heroku_ebooks, and store it in the very top directory of your computer. Update Your Settings Navigate to the heroku_ebooks folder on your computer, and open up local_settings_example.py. In a text editor, copy and paste the entire contents into a new document, which you’ll then save as local_settings.py. Fill in your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token Key, and Access Token Secret in the allotted spaces. If you’re unsure which those are, here’s a hint: they’re in exactly the same order as they appeared on dev.twitter.com.   Here are mine as they appear in order, though blurred out. Don’t ever share secret keys—that’s gotten Amazon Web Services customers in trouble! When it says to list the account, don’t write out the full Twitter account URL (twitter.com/selenaebooks) or even put an @ in front of the Twitter username (@selenaebooks). Here’s how I did the @SelenaEbooks account:   Note that I set both T/F (true/false) variables to FALSE. If the first one isn’t set this way, it won’t be able to write to Twitter.   Sign Up For And Install Heroku We’re going to create this app by installing a free app-developer program called Heroku. First, go to Heroku.com and sign up for an account. I know you may be reluctant to do this, but you’re going to need to have a “verified” account, and that means inputting your credit card information. I wish Heroku didn’t do it this way, but it’s necessary for later, and I've never been charged a cent.  Now that we’re signed up, here's the problem: Our heroku_ebooks program files are on our computer, not the Web. So we need to use Heroku on our computer. Download Heroku Toolbelt in order to do that.  Once Heroku is installed, go to your command-line window—in Terminal on the Mac, in the Windows command line on Windows machines. We need to build a Heroku app, but we want to make sure it builds in the right place.  cd heroku_ebooks  Once inside, we need to start up Git. For me, this was the most complicated part of the project. I kept getting an error where Git was unable to find my app, unless I typed exactly the following: git init git add . git commit -am "Add all files" heroku create --stack cedar git push heroku master With the first three lines, we’re setting up a fresh initialization of Git in this folder and told it to include and track the documents already located in this folder. Then, we’re using the “Heroku create” command to build a new app on the cedar stack. Celadon Cedar, or cedar for short, is a deployment environment for Heroku. It lets Heroku access libraries that allow it to understand Python, Ruby, and any other language you want to build apps with. Heroku has a nature-based naming convention, and it’ll randomly assign a name to your app based on that, in this case “damp-spire-9517.” You never have to change the name of the app since it won't show publicly—it'll just be how you identify it in your Heroku account. In this screenshot, I've moved on from making fun of my colleague Selena Larson and tackled my boss, Owen Thomas, with @OwenEbooks. With the final line, we’re pushing out all our heroku_ebooks files, including the local_settings.py file we built, to our Heroku app’s home on the Web. Heroku stores them in its servers and will run the app for us.  Note: if you made a mistake in local_settings.py and need to update it, it’s just like doing any other update in Git. First, change the file, save, and exit. Then, back on the command line: cd heroku_ebooks git add local_settings.py git commit -am “Update local_settings.py” git push heroku master You shouldn’t get this error if you’ve done everything the way I said, but the most common error is going to be:   !     Push rejected, no Cedar-supported app detected This means it can’t find a Heroku app in the heroku_ebooks folder. Remove and reinitialize Git with: rm -rf .git git init git add . Then try once more to create a new Heroku app in the folder.  If it is working, you’ll get this notice instead: -----> Python app detected  Once it’s done pushing changes to the master branch, you can test to see if it’s working: heroku run worker This will give you one of two responses:  1 No, sorry, not this time.  In this response, “1” could be any number 1 through 7, or, an actual tweet: If you get an error that the program is unable to write to Twitter, make sure you gave it read and write permission back in dev.twitter.com. That’s an early mistake I made. This program works as a random number generator. As a result, it seems like it takes forever to get “heroku run worker” to deliver anything. Ugh. If you get REALLY frustrated, you can raise its chances from 1 in 8 to 1 in 4, etc. on the ODDS line in local_settings.py. Schedule Tweets For The Future Once you’ve got your first tweet—a step you really should take to verify everything's working—you’ll want to schedule “heroku run worker” to run at regular intervals during the day, so you don’t have to manually tweet for it yourself. Type: heroku addons:add scheduler:standard If you didn’t “verify” your Heroku account with a credit card, this command won’t work. Go get that credit card! Otherwise, type this once the scheduler installs: heroku addons:open scheduler It’ll take you to a page on Heroku where you can configure the program. Name it “worker,” and set the frequency to “hourly.” Hit save. This is where the random number generator comes in. To keep the account from spamming Twitter, “heroku run worker” runs once an hour. But instead of tweeting every time, it’s actually rolling a die. Every 8th time or so, it hits gold. As a result, your randomizer accounts should update about three times a day. Enjoy your new Twitter bot, and be sure to share it with me in the comments!

                                EPA/Haim Zach Crises have their uses. If nothing else, they remind us how the international system works, who has power, and what’s at stake when things fall apart. The current, depressingly familiar, mayhem in Iraq provides a sobering reminder that even well-intentioned external powers may be able to do little to solve problems that have their roots in long-standing local rivalries. Even without an overlay of ethnic and religious tensions, Iraq’s problems defy easy resolution. As in so much of the world, the arbitrary boundaries laid down by former colonial powers bore little relationship to social facts on the ground. The widespread predilection for authoritarian solutions to the resulting struggle for order and cohesion was the all too predictable consequence of European imperialism and its dissolution. Plainly, ‘the West’ has much to answer for historically. One of the key questions now is what responsibility the current generation has in trying to atone for, let alone resolve, such troubling legacies. At what point does trying to make amends become unjustified and unwanted interference? Even if it is accepted that the so-called developed, undoubtedly dominant, and invariably democratic powers ought to do something what form could it possibly take? More pointedly, might it actually do more harm than good? These questions have assumed greater urgency as a consequence of a series of international crises that have come to a bloody head in Iraq. At such times there are inevitable expectations that the ‘international community’ ought to do something. These hopes are invariably unfulfilled for a very simple reason: there is not such thing as the international community. To be sure, if the number of times ideas are piously invoked is any measure of significance, the international community ought to be at the centre of international affairs. But when push comes to shove as it all too frequently does these days, the international community is conspicuous by it absence. At best the international community is a synonym for the usual suspects; a coterie of primarily western states whose strategic loyalties and normative predispositions generally align with those of the United States. Perhaps the international community’s most promising moment recently was in the first Gulf War, when a coalition of 34 nations led by the United States responded to Iraq’s invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Even then, however, this was a small fraction of the nearly 200 members of the United Nations. The contrast was the second conflict with Iraq, when a much smaller ‘coalition of the willing’ embarked on a catastrophically misjudged mission of regime change, is a painful reminder of the perils of hubris and an essentially unilateral approach to foreign policy. To guard against such disasters in the future, the creation of an effective international community might actually be a good idea for at least two reasons. First, being hegemonic is very agreeable, no doubt, but the weight of expectations that comes with it can be crippling at times. Whatever the US does in the current crisis only one thing is certain: not everyone will be happy. Even domestically, this is a no-win situation for an Obama administration judged to be weak and indecisive by its growing legion of critics. Internationally, the ‘great Satan’ is only likely to add to the list of its implacable enemies if it gets directly involved in the Middle East again. The second counterintuitive reason for actually creating an international community, therefore, is that it potentially relieves the US of the burdens and opprobrium that come with leadership. Even the it’s-all-about-oil arguments look far less convincing now that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> revolution is about to make the US energy independent. There is no immediate benefit for the US in intervening, other than stabilising – for the moment, at least – a region whose fate ultimately rests in its own hands. Despite the recent self-serving protestations of innocence from the likes of Dick Cheney and Tony Blair, few now think that invasion of Iraq was a worthwhile endeavour. A Bush administration that was constrained by international opinion and better advised by more independently-minded allies might not have embarked on such an egregious folly, and we might have avoided the horrors that are unfolding as a direct consequence. It is easy to be wise after the event, of course, but it is striking how some of the same misguided arguments are being recycled. The short-term choices facing Obama are all awful; none of them are likely to resolve the underlying deep-seated problems or restore order to a region whose collective future looks increasingly bleak. There is, however, one thing that the US and its allies can do, and that is to set about creating an effective and expanded international community that actually lives up to the title. This will, of course, not be easy. The UN’s problems are legion and well known, yet it remains the starting point for any serious attempt to actually address the growing list of collective action problems that confront humanity. It is worth the effort. True, the US will be constrained, but it will also be relieved of the manifold costs of actions that will never be universally supported. It is neither politically feasible nor normatively desirable that a single country bears this sort of this burden. Finding ways to act collectively and inclusively is the challenge for the post-hegemonic 21st century. The survival of an international civilisation worthy of the name may depend on it.

                                Tobacco companies cajole, convince, and promote their deadly products to billions across the globe.Nikolai Vassiliev, CC BY-NC-SA Lung cancer, a leg amputation, or gasping for air as a result of emphysema are not fun ways of ending one’s life. All are common outcomes of smoking, and if current global patterns of smoking continue – 50% of young men and 10% of young women becoming smokers – one billion people are estimated to die this century. And they will be mainly from low- and middle-income countries. In Australia, it is perhaps hard to fathom that three out every five men smoked in the 1950s, yet levels like this are the norm in countries such as Indonesia, China, Russia and Egypt. There is one, and only one, major driver of this global epidemic – the tobacco industry. The industry is dominated by six big firms: China National Tobacco Corporation, Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International, Imperial Tobacco and the Altria Group/Philip Morris USA. These companies are not shrinking away. In fact, they have rapidly shifted their attention to the developing world by implanting themselves firmly in local economies, where they can operate with little regulation or controls. Tobacco retail sales have had an average annual growth of 2% in low- and middle-income countries compared to 0.1% in high income countries in the 12 years to 2009. Take Philip Morris International in Indonesia, where 40% of 13- to 15-year-old boys smoke. It bought local company Sampoerna and is positioning Indonesia as the centre of the Marlboro brand production to cater for demands in the Asia-Pacific region. As Sampoerna President Director Paul Janelle said last year: We have invested more than $390 million in Karawang since 2006 […] PMID and Sampoerna are committed to long-term business in Indonesia. China has a major problem with 300 million people smoking, 75% of its adults do not have a comprehensive understanding of the health hazards of smoking. The tobacco industry is a government-owned monopoly, and the ministry that oversees the tobacco monopoly also controls key aspects of tobacco control policy, including prices and warning labels. It is hard to imagine a greater conflict of interest. China’s tobacco industry is a government-owned monopoly. EPA/Michael Reynolds Tobacco is one of the great commercial successes of our time. They have a very simple model, which needs little innovation or R&D – simply because the product sells itself through addiction. Their aim is to get young people to take it up, so they will continue for life and can then ensure their children smoke (children of smokers are twice as likely to smoke as non-smokers). The fact that half of their clients will die, on average, 12 years prematurely is of no concern to them. They have built the perfect model of intergenerational addiction and early death. Their stocks, yields and margins are, unlike their products, very healthy. It is estimated that A$8.5 billion of Australia’s super funds are invested in tobacco companies, with very few Australians aware they might be supporting the tobacco industry. So despite the fact that the tobacco industry ranks the lowest in the reputation index, they still manage to generate enormous profits. As they have done in countries such as Australia and the United States, tobacco companies in the developing world use intimidatory, highly unethical tactics to pursue their sales. They bias research findings, co-opt policy makers and health professionals, they donate to and lobby politicians and public officials to oppose public regulation and try to influence voters to oppose public health regulation. In Africa, tobacco companies are threatening to sue countries claiming their laws violate international legal obligations. It is worth recalling that these countries have virtually no capacity to defend themselves in court and the transnational companies have far bigger bank reserves than the countries themselves. Tobacco sales have grown around 2% a year in low- and middle-income countries. Crispin Semmens/Flickr, CC BY-SA The world has responded with the establishment of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention of Tobacco Control in 2005. It was developed in response to the globalisation of the tobacco epidemic, and does represent a major advance for tobacco control. But the majority of countries are yet to implement the policies that work (taxation, advertising bans, smoke-free environments, health warnings and media campaigns). This is because many national governments, the international development community, and philanthropic groups (with the admirable exception of Bloomberg and the Gates foundations) have simply not woken up to the huge preventable death and disability toll related to tobacco. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, health funding for tobacco control totalled US$68 million in 2011, less than 1/100th the amount spent on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, and of course a tiny amount compared to the US$1.7 trillion spent on arms in the same year. The fact that the tobacco industry can continue to get away with causing such devastating levels of premature death and illness is because they have become “part of the furniture” in so many countries. It is only over the last few decades that smoking has become much less normal or “cool” in wealthier countries. But the battle continues and this has been clearly shown by the recent front page story in The Australian claiming that plain packaging has failed. Fuelled by data from the tobacco industry only, the obvious reason for such a banner headline was so that it could be reproduced by the Murdoch press in the UK and Europe where the Irish, UK and French governments have made it clear they want to pursue plain packaging. Plain packs aim to stop young people taking up smoking. AAP Image/Lukas Coch It is no coincidence that Rupert Murdoch was on the board of Phillip Morris for 12 years, and in turn News Corporation have had a succession of Phillip Morris executives on their board (Hamish Maxwell, Geoffrey Bible and Peter Barnes). Phillip Morris' own documents show how they used their “clout” with the media such as News Corporation – even to the point of funding columnists to attack the science of tobacco control on FoxNews.com. Ask any executive in a tobacco company if they’d like their children to smoke and you can be sure of the answer – it will be a resounding no! Because they’ve understood the science of tobacco and they know it is addictive and it kills prematurely. But they are still happy to cajole, convince, and promote their deadly products to billions across the globe. To me that simply stinks.

                                It's no longer in doubt: Facebook is the world's largest open source company. Facebook could already have been considered to be in the open source lead through the release of its datacenter designs, databases and more. This week's open-sourcing of a network switch (Wedge) and its operating system (FBOSS) have cemented Facebook's place atop the podium of open source contributors. But have they also sounded the death knell for open source companies? After all, with so much incredible open source code emerging from Facebook, Google (which released PDFium this week), LinkedIn and others, is there still room for companies to sell open-source software? Inside The New Software Factory It has always been true that most software is developed for use, not sale, as author and open source advocate Eric Raymond famously pointed out in his  2001 book The Cathedral And The Bazaar. Yet most of our attention has been on software vendors as we place bets on Oracle or IBM, SAP or Microsoft et al. These are billion-dollar software companies, but the overall value of software being developed by open-source communities and behind the enterprise firewall is in the trillions of dollars, Red Hat's Michael Tiemann highlighted in 2009.  While nearly all software has been constrained by myopic, proprietary licensing, that's starting to change. Facebook and other Web giants recognize great value in releasing their code. The best developers want to work on the best code and increasingly the best code is open source. So Netflix, ostensibly a streaming video company, regularly hosts open source engineering days at its headquarters and makes a point of releasing its software in order to attract developers. That being said, Netflix did announce this week that it will be retiring its public application programming interface last week. All of which is great: more open source, more awesome. But for all the open-source software being developed and released by such companies, precious little is being supported in a way that makes it easy for mainstream enterprises to embrace. Spit, Polish And Commitment A good case in point is the Apache Cassandra project, which Facebook built and open sourced in 2008 to support its messaging system. Two years later, Facebook had moved on. As the company iterated on its messaging system, Facebook switched from Cassandra to Hbase: In 2008 we open-sourced Cassandra, an eventual-consistency key-value store that was already in production serving traffic for Inbox Search. Our Operations and Databases teams have extensive knowledge in managing and running MySQL, so switching off of either technology was a serious concern. We either had to move away from our investment in Cassandra or train our Operations teams to support a new, large system. We spent a few weeks setting up a test framework to evaluate clusters of MySQL, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, and a couple of other systems. We ultimately chose HBase. MySQL proved to not handle the long tail of data well; as indexes and data sets grew large, performance suffered. We found Cassandra's eventual consistency model to be a difficult pattern to reconcile for our new Messages infrastructure. Facebook, in other words, doesn't necessarily stick with a technology just because Facebook created it. As former Facebook engineer Steven Grimm notes, "Facebook is very pragmatic about which tools we use; the fact that Cassandra was originally developed in-house doesn't give it a significant leg up when we're deciding how to store the data for some new site feature, except in that the fact that we already have in-house expertise would factor into decisions about maintainability and so forth." Which is great for Facebook, but not necessarily for the many companies that have since embraced Cassandra like Netflix and Cisco. Especially for mainstream enterprises, they want an element of stability that Facebook simply can't deliver, because Facebook isn't in the business of supporting the software it open sources. A Continued Need For Open Source Companies Which is why we're just at the beginning of the "open source company" era, not the end. For every significant open-source project released by Facebook or its peers, there will be companies set up to provide ongoing maintenance and support for the code.  While it has become trite to declare that "every company must be a software company," the reality is most companies are a long way off from this goal. Even for companies with core competency in developing software, they don't necessarily have bandwidth to take on the maintenance of every open-source project that they use. As such, there will always be a need for open source companies who specialize in supporting software, not simply writing it. Cassandra offers a great example, with DataStax providing commercial support and ongoing development of the code, now residing with the Apache Software Foundation. But there are many other examples, like Hadoop, launched at Yahoo! and now supported by Hortonworks and Cloudera (among others), or Lucene, initially developed by Doug Cutting at Yahoo! but now supported by Elasticsearch, Lucidworks and others. We're entering the golden age of open source. All the most interesting, biggest trends in computing are being driven by open source, whether it's a mobile operating system running most of the world's smartphones, the cloud infrastructure supporting enterprise applications or the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> infrastructure that undergirds our ravenous desire for more data, better understood. And while much of this open-source software will be released by companies that aren't in the software business, per se, the best of it will be supported by those that are.

                                Budding friends.Anita363, CC BY-NC Humans have some regenerative abilities but compared to creatures like the salamander, which has an amazing ability to regenerate after injury, we’re pretty limited. Not only are salamanders the only adult vertebrates able to regrow full limbs, they’re able to regenerate an impressive repertoire of complex structures including parts of their hearts, eyes, spinal cord and tails. In recent years, researchers have been studying salamander regeneration in the hope that the knowledge gathered would contribute to understanding how can they regenerate, and how to promote human regeneration. Although we do not yet understand the exact mechanisms by which salamanders are able to regrow their limbs, we do know that this animal regeneration takes place by the reprogramming of adult cells. This means that for regeneration to take place, adult cells – such as muscle cells – that form the limb have to lose their muscle identity and proliferate to give rise to new cells that will contribute to form the new structure. This process is rarely found in mammalian cells and this has been suggested as the basis for their poor regenerative abilities. But clearly, unravelling the mechanisms underlying this reprogramming is central to understanding why certain vertebrates can regenerate their limbs while others can’t, and how to repeat this process in humans. If we were able to crack this puzzle, it could lead to strategies to enhance the reprogramming of cells from patients, and to better understand their disease and design appropriate cures. We recently found a critical component of the reprogramming mechanism. In our study, published in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Stem Cell">Stem Cell</a></span> Reports, we demonstrated that the sustained activation of a molecular pathway (a group of molecules in a cell that work together to control a particular function or functions) – called the ERK pathway – plays a key role during the natural reprogramming of salamander muscle cells. Only when the ERK pathway is constantly switched “on” are the cells able to re-enter the cell cycle, which is key to their regenerative potential. We also compared salamander and mammalian muscle cells. In contrast to salamander cells, we found that mammalian cells can only activate the ERK pathway transiently, and fail to keep the pathway switched “on”. Critically, we found that if we forced these mammalian cells to keep the ERK pathway activated (by giving them a piece of DNA that allows them to produce a protein that activates the pathway), the cells could produce the proteins involved in cell cycle re-entry. This suggests that the manipulation of the pathway could contribute to therapies to enhance the regenerative potential in humans. Our results also suggest that the ability to trigger sustained ERK activation may underlie the generation of cells with regenerative potential in different species. This also helps us understand vital and question of why only a few organisms can regenerate body structures, and limbs in the case of salamanders, whereas most cannot.

                                ReadWriteDrive is an ongoing series covering the future of transportation. When I first heard that Mercedes is integrating wearable technology—such as Pebble smartwatches and Google Glass—with its smart-vehicle systems, I thought the luxury automaker had a taken just a sip or two of Silicon Valley Kool-Aid. So I tried it out. Turns out, a week of driving a 2014 Mercedes CLA with Pebble tied to the car’s digital nervous system didn’t dispel my doubts about either the wisdom or usefulness of what I came to think of as wearing-while-driving. But I do have to give Mercedes credit for a gallant inaugural try at making the concept work. Driving While Wearing My smart-meets-smart experience started with plugging an iPhone into the car’s Lightning connector, which is tucked away in the glove box. It’s a good move that forces drivers to stow the phone away from temptation. The center dash’s 7-inch screen then turns into the interface for the Mercedes Digital DriveStyle app, which is still running on the iPhone. Think of DriveStyle as the main infotainment and navigation platform, delivered from the iPhone to the center console. (DriveStyle is only available for iOS at the moment.) You can then pair the Pebble to the phone via Bluetooth, after which it acts as a peripheral controller. It's quite the daisy chain of devices, and yet it's still not sufficient to complete the setup—the driver also needs to use the analog rotary dial controller between the front seats. I spun the dial to the “Media” category and then “Aux,” where I finished adding the Pebble to the chain. It takes a minute to wrap your mind around how everything is connected, but once you do, the setup isn't particularly complicated. When everything works and vehicle's engine is running, a little icon of a car appears on the top left corner of the watch. Bear in mind that my loaner Mercedes CLA 250 already has its own native dashboard infotainment and navigation functions, controlled by analog buttons and viewed on the center dash’s 7-inch screen. DriveStyle and Pebble supplant those old-school buttons. The digital high road aims to trump the analog world and its puny apps. Eyes on the Road What could not be overlooked is that I was driving a $43,245 Mercedes luxury automobile. Even without a lot of high-tech gear, the sporty CLA 250—with its 208-horsepower four-cylinder turbocharged engine, and paddle-controllable 7-speed transmission—would have provided sufficient cognitive engagement.  All I really needed was an open stretch of pavement and an easy way to crank up the volume on satellite radio. DriveStyle and the Pebble, however, offer an added layer of digital clutter. DriveStyle itself is a particularly flagrant offender. Start it up and the first thing you see are three vaguely named navigation categories—Social, Media and Places—each containing a bewildering set of apps. The Pebble aims to cut through some of that. Its primary function while driving is to get you to particular DriveStyle apps with a minimum of fuss. With my eyes mostly on the road, I could reach to the set of three buttons on the right side of the watch, and jump the dashboard screen into one of three pre-designated apps. (You can set these yourself, though not while you're driving.) A single push on the watch, for example, can start Google's traffic map, Apple's Siri, or Glympse, an app that lets you share your location with family or friends. Mercedes’s Pebble smartwatch effort—unveiled in January at 2014 CES, and made available a few weeks later—is ironically an attempt to re-focus drivers on driving by paring connectivity back to essential functions. Digital Shortcuts I came to think of the three buttons on the watch as an elaborate workaround to find things in DriveStyle, which itself supplanted the simpler use of analog buttons on the dash. Once you start daisy-chaining, I guess, it's hard to stop. While parked in my driveway, I had taken a look at DriveStyle’s social functionality—like access to bite-sized Facebook posts, Tweets or a social playlist of videos posted by friends. Those social tasks didn’t make sense to me. When I hit the road, I have zero desire to hear a robotic voice reading Ellen Degeneres’s latest tweets, one of the preset favorites on the loaner car. Things might be different if DriveStyle could read my texts or emails to me—but it can't, because iOS won't give it access to them. That left me looking for watch-based enhancements to the actual driving experience. I found the first example when I clicked my Pebble watch to bring up the Glympse app. The watch's only contribution to the proceedings was providing a shortcut to start the app. From there, I used the analog rotary dial on the center console to find my wife’s email address in the phone’s contacts, and set a time limit of 30 minutes. A moment later, my wife (back home) clicked on a link to open a page where she could track my progress on a map—eliminating any question about when I would be home. That was kind of handy, helping to avoid those inevitable texts: "R u close?" and "Be there in 5." As I drove, I found another item called “Places, Powered by Google” helpful, at least up to a point. That enabled searching for points of interest in a way that offers some improvement over the convoluted process most car-navigation systems force upon their users—usually by forcing them through a series of clumsy menus. The Places function, by contrast, at least allows you to search on words like "coffee," even if you do have to use the rotary dial to pick letters off the screen one at a time. The plus side here is that the DriveStyle app offers autocomplete results on the 7-inch screen, trumping the vehicle's native navigation system, and was available even on the move. (There’s no voice-recognition in the DriveStyle app for text entry.) A list of nearby cafes came up, providing distance from my location. Selecting one of the results allowed me to see open hours, star ratings, and a Google street view (controllable by the rotary dial). The way the street view images displayed, moving across as the dial spins, was slick. Mercedes realizes that smartphone innovation far outpaces the auto industry’s lumbering development cycle. By the time an automotive OEM can update its hardware, interface and apps, the electronics industry is at least a generation or two ahead. For example, the demo car natively connected to the Internet via 3G, while the tethered phone in the glove box was streaming by 4G LTE. The DriveStyle platform can add new apps as developers roll them out. Eventually, developers’ kits will allow third-party innovators to add driving apps. Good Vibrations A day or two of strapping on a Pebble watch only to use it for three shortcut buttons on my wrist left me wondering why Mercedes bothered. So I continued to toss the CLA around city streets and the winding roads of the Berkeley hills near where I live. And then the Pebble buzzed and flashed a screen reading, “Slow Down.” Turns out the DriveStyle’s Garmin integration, combined with GPS, had loaded up my location and local speed limits. When I exceeded the speed limit by about 10 percent, the watch vibrated and issued its warning. It’s standard Pebble functionality to push notifications when you get a text message, a phone call, or an email. Based on the type of vibration, you know what’s up without taking the phone out of your pocket. Mercedes took the idea of push notifications and repurposed it for driving safety. Different warnings for, say, a reported accident or road construction, each have their signature type of vibration, so you don’t have to take your eyes off the road to know lies ahead. I didn’t encounter an accident or road hazard during my week, so “Slow Down” was the only vibration I experienced. It was effective, and the only interaction with the watch that didn’t duplicate what the car would have provided without the wearable. Something about feeling the buzz—sort of a literal slap on the wrist—grabbed my attention. I slowed down. Another button on the Pebble would have let me push road condition notifications in the other direction—for instance, had I seen an accident that I wanted to report. Like the other functions started by the watch, completing the process would have required using the rotary dial, causing more distraction, and increasing chances that I would become the next accident. Yet Mercedes told me that on some models, if the driver pulls off the road, lifts the hood and puts on the emergency flashers, the car will automatically report the problem to other Mercedes app users. The company is looking to integrate this functionality with Waze and similar services not limited to Mercedes cars. Car Apps Outside the Car When you reach your destination and power down the car, the mode-icon on the top left of the phone switches from a car to a walking person. As you step away from the car, the watch receives a full download of your car’s precise location, the trip distance, the amount of fuel left in the tank, and—apparently for use in case your car is stolen—the car’s model name and VIN number. On some models, though not my loaner CLA, you also get a reading of air pressure for all four tires. I liked these functions, but saw them more as a curiosity than essential <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span>. In addition to Mercedes’s Pebble integration, I also got a five-minute run-through of how Google Glass could become part of the driving experience. The same diagnostics delivered to the watch after a drive—as well as walking directions from where you parked to where you need to go—can be deployed to Glass. This was my very first experience with Google Glass, so most of my time was spent simply fitting the device to my face and making the screen visible.  The simplicity of the watch made more sense for getting a quick read on fuel and tire pressure. Google Glass is also put to use prior to getting into the car. As you stroll to your car, speak your desired point of interest to Glass. The eyeglass screen then provides walking turn-by-turn directions first to your car, and then driving turn-by-turn instructions to the dashboard navigation. Theoretically, there's no downtime, and the act of driving and living become a single blurred experience.   That idea, and more generally the use of wearables behind the wheel, has some merit.  I’m sure that Mercedes and other automakers will continue to experiment. But I have to admit that after a week, I was relieved to return the CLA and Pebble—and get back to my own dumb car, with its simple singular interface designed simply for driving.

                                Solar City’s acquisition of a solar-panel startup could help it lower installation costs and produce inexpensive solar power, but it’ll need more production capacity. Billionaire, Tesla founder, and private space entrepreneur <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> announced yesterday that Solar City, the solar installation company where he is chairman, plans to acquire a startup called Silevo for $200 million (plus up to $150 million more if the company meets certain goals). And with typical bravado, he also said that the company plans to build a huge factory to produce Silevo’s high-efficiency solar panels, a strategy he claims will make solar power “way cheaper” than power from fossil fuels.

NASA may use a quadcopter to explore the surface of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, according to a new interview at Science Recorder with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory senior researcher Larry Matthies. Titan is widely speculated to have chemical processes that are "prebiotic," which are similar to those that existed on a pre-life planet Earth. Scientists also believe that its icy shell masks a massive ocean of liquid water which could, in theory, be the nearest possible reservoir of life off our own planet.

                                THE author of “Fifty Shades of Grey”, E.L. James, has mused at length about a billionaire inflicting punishment in her bondage-based bestseller. As the recipient of one of the first right-hand-drive versions of the Tesla Model S to hit Britain’s roads, personally handed to her at an event in London last week by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>, the carmaker’s wealthy boss, she is clearly attuned to billionaires dishing out pleasure too. The “range anxiety” that afflicts other electric-car owners has been minimised in the Model S by packing it with lots of batteries; the agony-inducing cost of filling up at the petrol station need never bother Ms James again.Other all-electric cars, costly and with limited ranges, have proved a hard sell. The models from most mainstream carmakers still look and feel like gimmicks. Tesla’s main achievement is producing a car which can be judged credibly alongside any fast and expensive petrol-propelled saloon. But the Californian company’s long-term growth prospects, and the widespread adoption of electric cars, are both dependent on a big drop in battery costs. Tesla’s next mission, to begin making a cheaper, mass-market electric vehicle...

                                MEDIOBANCA was founded in 1946 with an explicit mission to rebuild Italian industry in the aftermath of the second world war. The result was a web of cross-shareholdings and pacts among big shareholders, with the Milanese investment bank at its centre, which allowed a narrow elite to control many of the country’s biggest businesses for decades. So the announcement last year that Mediobanca would exit these pacts and focus on its core business constituted a dramatic reversal. What with a similar move by Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer, the web is beginning to look a little tattered (see chart).Mediobanca has sold €800m ($1.1 billion) of equities over the past nine months, half of its three-year goal. Both it and Generali say they will exit the pact that controls Telecom Italia this month, and eventually sell their shares. Privatisation is also changing things. The government is selling part of Fincantieri, one of Europe’s biggest shipbuilders, this month; Poste Italiane, the postal service, will probably be next. Many privately held firms plan offerings too, led by Cerved, a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>-services company.

                                EXUBERANCE about both “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” and Twitter has of late given way to a degree of scepticism among commentators.

Founded in 2009 to scour the Twittersphere for important events and news not yet reported by the mainstream media, the firm now has dozens of customers in finance, the news business and the public sector. In January it and Twitter struck a deal to provide alerts to CNN. In April its tracking of tweets was part of a strategy by the authorities in Boston to avoid a repeat of last year’s terrorist attack at the city’s annual marathon.Dataminr scores every tweet using about 30 indicators of significance, says Ted Bailey, who launched the firm with two former Yale roommates. Dataminr started out seeking market-sensitive information for investors. It now supplies around 50 financial firms. Then came various arms of government; Mr Bailey claims ten clients, though he will name only the city of Boston.Sorting out the signal from the Twitter noise is not easy.
