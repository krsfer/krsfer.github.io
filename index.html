                                DOVER, N.H. — Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul took a direct shot at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton here on Friday, giving a small preview of strategies he may use if they face off in the 2016 presidential race.  Paul has been traversing the country lately, giving speeches at venues both friendly and unfriendly in his attempt to broaden the base of the Republican Party. On Friday, at a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> Republican Party event, he said the GOP has an opportunity with young people because President Barack Obama's positions on issues like National Security Agency spying no longer resonate with them. Then, he turned to Clinton. "Hillary Clinton's as bad or worse on all these issues. It's a way we can transform and make the party bigger," he said of targeting young voters, in a message that sounded as if he was presuming Clinton's nomination. Paul's 13-minute speech was well received before a small crowd of about 175. He railed against the Affordable Care Act, NSA spying, and "big government." Overall, Paul's message was similar to speeches he has given in the past month at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland and the University of California, Berkley. He argued that, for Republicans to change the status quo, the party has to start winning elections — and that means expanding its base. "To win elections, you have to have more people in your party. You have to have a bigger party," Paul said. "So let's not dilute the message. Some Republicans say, we need to be more like the Democrats. ... I say, that's hogwash. We don't need to dilute our message. We need to be more bold with our message." The crowd at Cottage By The Bay, a small venue tucked away deep on a side street in Dover, was filled with a mix of avid libertarians and Paul supporters along with establishment Republicans curious to hear what he had to say.  Among those who were not already Paul supporters, the biggest concern about Paul was his rather isolationist position on foreign policy. Tom Homer, a Republican who has lived in Manchester, N.H., for the last 45 years, said he identifies more with the foreign policy positions of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has lately drawn clear distinctions between himself and Paul. Sue, a Republican from Portsmouth, said she worried Paul was too much like his father, Ron, on foreign policy issues. One veteran, though, said Paul's foreign policy is the thing he likes most about him.  "Someone like him is not going to send troops needlessly overseas," Jason Penrod, a 29-year-old who served in Afghanistan from 2012-13, told Business Insider after Paul's speech. "Nothing we're doing is working, and he knows that." Join the conversation about this story »

                                Thorium, an element named after the Norse god of thunder, may soon contribute to the world's electricity supply. Well begun; half done. That proverb--or, rather, its obverse--encapsulates the problems which have dogged civil nuclear power since its inception. Atomic energy is seen by many, and with reason, as the misbegotten stepchild of the world's atom-bomb programmes: ill begun and badly done. But a clean slate is a wonderful thing. And that might soon be provided by two of the world's rising industrial powers, India and China, whose demand for energy is leading them to look at the idea of building reactors that run on thorium. Existing reactors use uranium or plutonium--the stuff of bombs. Uranium reactors need the same fuel-enrichment technology that bomb-makers employ, and can thus give cover for clandestine weapons programmes. Plutonium is made from unenriched uranium in reactors whose purpose can easily be switched to bomb-making. Thorium, though, is hard to turn into a bomb; not impossible, but sufficiently uninviting a prospect that America axed thorium research in the 1970s. It is also three or four times as abundant as uranium. In a world where nuclear energy was a primary goal of research, rather than a military spin-off, it would certainly look worthy of investigation. And it is, indeed, being investigated. India has abundant thorium reserves, and the country's nuclear-power programme, which is intended, eventually, to supply a quarter of the country's electricity (up from 3% at the moment), plans to use these for fuel. This will take time. The Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research already runs a small research reactor in Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu, and the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai plans to follow this up with a thorium-powered heavy-water reactor that will, it hopes, be ready early next decade. China's thorium programme looks bigger. The Chinese Academy of Sciences claims the country now has "the world's largest national effort on thorium", employing a team of 430 scientists and engineers, a number planned to rise to 750 by 2015. This team, moreover, is headed by Jiang Mianheng, an engineering graduate of Drexel University in the United States who is the son of China's former leader, Jiang Zemin (himself an engineer). Some may question whether Mr Jiang got his job strictly on merit. His appointment, though, does suggest the project has political clout. The team plan to fire up a prototype thorium reactor in 2015. Like India's, this will use solid fuel. But by 2017 the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics expects to have one that uses a trickier but better fuel, molten thorium fluoride. Thorium itself is not fissile. If bombarded by neutrons, though, it turns into an isotope of uranium, {+2}{+3}{+3}U, which is. Thorium can thus be burned in a conventional reactor along with enriched uranium or plutonium to provide the necessary neutrons. But a better way is to turn the element into its fluoride, mix that with fluorides of beryllium and lithium to bring its melting-point down from 1,110ºC to a more tractable 360ºC, and melt the mixture. The resulting liquid can be pumped into a specially designed reactor core, where fission raises its temperature to 700ºC or so. It then moves on to a heat exchanger, to transfer its newly acquired heat to a gas (usually carbon dioxide or <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helium">helium</a></span>) which is employed to drive turbines that generate electricity. That done, the now-cooled fluoride mixture returns to the core to be recharged with heat. This is roughly how America's experimental thorium reactor, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, worked in the 1960s. Its modern incarnation is known as an LFTR (liquid-fluoride thorium reactor). The benefits of fluoridation One of the cleverest things about LFTRs is that they work at atmospheric pressure. This changes the economics of nuclear power. In a light-water reactor, the type most commonly deployed at the moment, the cooling water is under extremely high pressure. As a consequence, light-water reactors need to be sheathed in steel pressure vessels and housed in fortress-like containment buildings in case their cooling systems fail and radioactive steam is released. An LFTR needs none of these. Thorium is also easier to prepare than its rivals. Only 0.7% of natural uranium is the fissionable isotope {+2}{+3}{+5}U. The rest is {+2}{+3}{+8}U, which is heavier because it has three more neutrons, and does not undergo fission because of the stability these neutrons bring. This is why uranium has to be enriched by the complicated process of centrifugation. Plutonium is made by bombarding {+2}{+3}{+8}U with neutrons in a manner similar to the conversion of thorium into {+2}{+3}{+3}U. In its case, however, this requires a separate reactor from the one the plutonium is eventually burned in. By contrast thorium, once extracted from its ore, is reactor-ready. It does, it is true, need a seed of uranium or plutonium to provide neutrons to start the ball rolling. Once enough of it has been converted into {+2}{+3}{+3}U, though, the process becomes self-sustaining, with neutrons from the fission of {+2}{+3}{+3}U transmuting sufficient thorium to replace the {+2}{+3}{+3}U as it is consumed. The seed material then becomes superfluous and can, because the fuel is liquid, be flushed out of the reactor along with the fission products generated when {+2}{+3}{+3}U atoms split up. Similarly, more thorium fluoride can be bled in as needed. The consequence is that thorium reactors can run non-stop for years, unlike light-water reactors. These have to be shut down every 18 months to replace batches of fuel rods. Bombs away? Thorium has other advantages, too. Even the waste products of LFTRs are less hazardous than those of a light-water reactor. There is less than a hundredth of the quantity and its radioactivity falls to safe levels within centuries, instead of the tens of millennia for light-water waste. Paradoxically, though, given thorium's history, it is the difficulty of weaponising thorium which many see (as it were) as its killer app in civil power stations. One or two {+2}{+3}{+3}U bombs were tested in the Nevada desert during the 1950s and, perhaps ominously, another was detonated by India in the late 1990s. But if the American experience is anything to go by, such bombs are temperamental and susceptible to premature detonation because the intense gamma radiation {+2}{+3}{+3}U produces fries the triggering circuitry and makes handling the weapons hazardous. The American effort was abandoned after the Nevada tests. The gamma-ray problem is created by a quirk of the process that turns thorium into {+2}{+3}{+3}U. A small amount takes a different path and ends up as radioactive thallium--which is very radioactive indeed. Its gamma rays are so powerful that they can penetrate concrete a metre thick. Extracting, smelting and machining material containing even trace amounts of it is beyond the scope of all but a handful of national weapons laboratories. Rogue nations interested in an atom bomb are thus likely to leave thorium reactors well alone when there is so much poorly policed plutonium scattered around the world.

                                Gazprom’s decision to hike the price of the gas it sells to Ukraine came as no surprise as it was flagged more than a month ago. At that time the company’s website showed the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, and Gazprom’s chairman, Alexei Miller, sitting across a desk discussing what to do about Ukraine’s outstanding debt for current gas supplies. As if anyone needed convincing, this cosy image makes clear the use of Gazprom as a tool of Russian foreign policy. But it is this same foreign policy that may yet threaten the future of Gazprom – one of the world’s largest companies. Europe needs Russian gas just as much as Gazprom needs Europe’s cash. The company has clashed with Ukraine – and by extension the rest of Europe – over supply twice before: in 2006 and 2009. But those were primarily commercial disputes with geopolitical undertones – this time the situation is reversed. Ironically, 2013 proved a bumper year for Gazprom. Total sales were worth US$162 billion, exports to Europe accounted for 39% of this and exports through Ukraine about 20%. The bottom line is that it does not serve the Kremlin or Gazprom well to disrupt gas supplies to Europe. Even before the current crisis all was not well for Gazprom in Europe. The European Commission has threatened antitrust charges over the way it prices gas and demand has fallen due to the economic downturn, subsidies for renewable power, the low cost of carbon trading and the availability of cheap coal; all of which means that gas is losing out badly to coal and renewables. The company has granted discounts and relaxed contract terms, but the vast majority of its sales remain oil-indexed and long-term (which also means that many of its European customers are tied in to contracts for years to come). The EU’s options are clearly limited by its ongoing dependence on Russian gas. Though Russia’s share of EU-27 imports of natural gas declined from 45.1% to 31.8% between 2003 and 2010, there are still calls for further reductions. In the past the EU’s key worry over Gazprom’s gas was one of “transit security”, especially through Ukraine. Gazprom responded by rerouting supply lines. A major pipeline running under the Baltic Sea to Germany was completed in 2011, and another pipeline running through the Black Sea and the Balkans was due to be completed in 2018 though this project is now on hold. Today, the EU is more worried about where its gas comes from than how it gets there. Reliance on Russia is the problem; Europe hopes alternative suppliers are the solution. Gas from Azerbaijan and beyond might help, as would <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> either imported from the US or developed within the EU. But the reality is that these developments are unlikely to deliver significant amounts of new gas before the end of this decade, if at all. The proposed “single European gas market” could be an interim solution. A truly competitive market would then force Gazprom and other Russian suppliers to adhere to market principles (this might yet be the outcome of the EC antitrust case). But for the near term at least it will be very difficult for the EU to turn its back on Russian gas supplies. Even if new suppliers are found in the long term there will still be an opportunity cost for EU members as Russian gas remains the cheapest source of supply. The EU’s ambitious climate change and energy policy could be another solution, as energy efficiency and renewables promotion will both reduce gas demand. Whichever path is pursued – and the likelihood is an Obama-like “all of the above” approach – Gazprom will lose market share in Europe and its fortunes will then depend on Russia and the rest of Asia. Putin travels to Beijing next month and hopes to sign a long-term gas agreement with China. After years of negotiations, the two sides have agreed on everything but the price. However, although China needs to burn more gas and less coal to address its air pollution crisis, recent events might make Beijing wary of tying itself into a long-term relationship with Russia. But equally, events in Europe might make the Russian side more willing to concede on price, thus making agreement more likely. If the two countries fail to strike a deal, Gazprom will be in a tough spot and may yet fall victim to rivals. Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned oil giant wants to develop its own gas business and is seeking access to Gazprom’s planned pipeline in Asia. Late last year Gazprom lost its monopoly over Russia’s gas exports and it now faces stiff competition from Rosneft and others. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Gazprom will not remain intact much longer. Michael Bradshaw receives funding from the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC)

                                From Shakespearean flash mobs in London, to zombies and a “dying” koala at one of Australia’s most popular art galleries in Brisbane, there are growing protests over big oil and gas companies' sponsorship of the arts. Corporate polluters engage in art sponsorship as part of their quest for what they call a “social license” to operate. That means winning local, national, and international communities support. A Santos sign during the Brisbane Festival, 2012. Gord McKenna/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND For instance, global oil and gas company BP has powerful, enduring relationships with Britain’s principal cultural institutions as measured by size, visits, and media coverage, including the National Gallery, the National Maritime Museum, Tate Britain, the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, and the National Gallery. The company says it “has proudly supported arts and culture in the UK for over 35 years”, with particular reverence for exhibits that attract large numbers of visitors. At a cost of £10 million in 2011, that’s small fry for a company with revenue that year of US$75,475 million. In 2006, BP gave a million dollars to Long Beach’s Aquarium of the Pacific. When one of its oilrigs exploded in the Gulf of Mexico four years later, both sides reconsidered the partnership. In the UK, BP quickly withdrew much of its marketing. Today, the company enjoys prominant naming rights over the “BP Sea Otter Habitat”. The friendly face of pollution Blockbuster shows sponsored by environmental miscreants give alibis to big cultural institutions, as well as big environmental polluters, by countering populist claims that only élite segments of society visit such places. And they associate populism with big oil. One of the biggest exhibitions currently on in Australia is Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang’s dramatic Falling Back to Earth, held at the popular Queensland Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) in Brisbane. About 20 protesters dressed as zombie farmers in 2012. AAP Image/Marty Silk The presenting sponsor is the Santos GLNG Project, a US$18.5 billion consortium that is converting coal seam natural gas (CSG) to liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export to global markets. It involves tapping into vast gas fields in the Bowen and Surat Basins in Queensland, constructing a 420 kilometre underground gas transmission pipeline to the coastal city of Gladstone, and a two-train LNG processing facility on Curtis Island in Gladstone. In a stunt last month, protesters from Generation Alpha went to GOMA after it was revealed Santos had contaminated a water aquifer in north-west New South Wales with arsenic, uranium, lead and nickel. One protester dressed as a koala drank the water and pretended to die. It followed a similar protest two years ago, when activists dressed as zombie farmers gatecrashed an opening night event. Greenwash Rising Tide UK’s Art Not Oil project takes as its motto “For creativity, climate justice and an end to oil industry sponsorship of the arts”. The project began in 2004 as a challenge and stimulus to current and potential artists to forge their practice and exhibitions in sustainable ways, and to work against the unsustainability of BP, Shell, and others—as businesses in general, but more particularly as sponsors of the arts. Rising Tide calls such sponsorship for what it is: greenwash. By sponsoring our cultural institutions, Shell tries to protect its reputation, distract our attention from its environmental and human rights crimes around the world and buy our acceptance. They are not alone. The Reclaim Shakespeare Company formed a flash mob (“Out Damn Logo”) to criticize the British Museum for accepting BP money to help fund “Shakespeare: Staging the World”. Yoko Ono goes a step further, beyond opposing sponsorship and towards protest, via her New York-based alliance Artists Against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fracking">Fracking</a></span>. Beyond petroleum For some, concerns about the ethics of corporate sponsorship of the arts go beyond the involvement of major energy companies. For instance, in February this year a group of international artists dropped fake dollar bills from the dramatic spiral at the Guggenheim in Manhattan to draw attention to the labor exploitation of migrant workers in Abu Dhabi, where the museum is building an outpost funded by oil profits. In Australia around the same time, longstanding sponsors of the Sydney Biennale withdrew because of a threatened boycott by artists in protest at the firm Transfield’s involvement with Australia’s overseas detention of refugees. Several critics, including the Australian government, complained about artists taking such political action, and threaten retribution. In an open letter to the Biennale’s Board, the artists explained that they rejected “adding value to the Transfield brand” because “participation is an active endorsement, providing cultural capital”. This raises questions about the responsibility of artists to provide social commentary and the responsibility of the arts bourgeoisie to secure ethical funding. Yelling fire, when it’s needed The artistic right to free speech is not, of course, absolute (it’s illegal in the US to shout “Fire!” in a theatre audience when there isn’t one). Speech is protected when it renews society through the force of critique. But instead of attacking artists for promoting justice, we should turn our gaze to cultural institutions’ complicity with malfeasance. Protesting “against the slimy spread of oil money through our theatres”. Reclaim Shakespeare Company, CC BY-NC-ND Critics might say that artistic appeals to people’s emotions, like those I’ve described, will fail for many reasons. That’s because the silent majority doesn’t like direct action; corporations can easily outspend activists; media coverage is partial and hostile; and crucial decisions are made by élites, not in streets. All those points are true. I generally incline towards that kind of critical view of populist activism. But not in this case. Good humour is crucial to sidestepping the common image of environmentalists as scolds. Equally, corporate excess must be opposed in public. And the media’s need for image and excitement can be twinned with serious discussion and involve people who are not conventional activists, Environmentalism does need to lighten up sometimes – and one way to do that is through sophisticated, entertaining, participatory spectacles, like flash mobs. The right blend of irony, sarcasm, and showmanship is a good way to mock high art’s dalliance with high polluters. Bravo.

Against those who see the radical possibilities of a frictionless payment system designed for the internet, there is a growing resistance to the currencies that threaten existing business models and the perceived traceability of our current currency systems. Leading the resistance against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> are the banks, with the latest recruit to these ranks, Australian bank NAB, closing accounts of customers whose businesses are engaged in exchanging cryptocurrencies. An Australian trader operating through Local<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s.com and an another Australian <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchange CoinJar have received letters from NAB informing them that: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currency">digital currency</a></span> providers pose an unacceptable level of risk, both to our business and reputation. NAB joins banks in China such as the Agricultural Bank of China, that has moved to freeze the accounts of one of China’s larger <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchanges, BtcTrade. Likewise, banks in Canada have already largely blocked accounts used for companies trading cryptocurrencies. Mt Gox the tipping point? It is easy to point to the recent failure of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchange Mt Gox and the subsequent law suits that have embroiled Japanese bank Mizhuo, as a catalyst for NAB’s move. But if banks refused to service businesses after one or more of their kind went bust, they would not be left with very many clients. The risk assessed was also not one based on the companies involved, their operations or their clients, it was simply a matter of the business they were in. Self-interest? While moves by banks to manage risk is something most customers would welcome, the global financial crisis showed us banks’ views of risk are highly selective and largely determined by the other part of this equation: the rewards. In terms of cryptocurrencies, the rewards to banks at present are very low. This is especially the case for a currency that is designed to largely cut them out of the picture. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and other <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> are designed to be exchanged directly between senders and receivers. This means that currently, transaction costs and bank fees can be avoided, so banks’ enthusiasm for supporting this industry or promoting it would be tepid at best. The real risk to banks is perhaps then not that posed by customers using accounts to enable <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchanges, but the threat to their bottom line. NAB’s own senior currency analyst Emma Lawson has argued <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> has many of the characteristics of regular currency, and that its potential to become a successful payment system it contingent on people’s continued belief in it. Clearly something that banks aren’t yet willing to see happen. Dirty money If banks are asked to justify their decisions purely on risk, they are likely to point to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s association with criminal activities. The rhetoric here has recently stepped up with the European police chief claiming we’re just seeing the beginning of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s use by criminal organisations. Other than the clear use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> as the payment system of illegal websites such as Silk Road), the use of cryptocurrencies as a proportion of the total value of money involved in crime is probably tiny. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2009 the total amount of money involved in global criminal activity was US$2.1 trillion. The total market capitilisation of all cryptocurrencies is currently less than US$10 billion. Cryptocurrencies may appear to be ideally suited to money laundering, but the problem is they eventually have to be exchanged for real currency, which immediately causes problems if you are trying to move large amounts of money. The second issue is the extremely volatile value of such currencies. There is a large risk that money with a certain value ends up being worth a lot less by the time it has been laundered and converted into a currency that can be actually put to some use. Of the U$2.1 trillion that is involved annually in global criminal activity, most, if not all, will pass through banks at some point, and not surprisingly, will drive revenue for those banks. The idea then that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> pose a larger theoretical threat seems somewhat absurd in comparison to the very real crime involving real currency. Masterly inactivity Governments around the world have moved to deal with the lack of regulations on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> by either banning the currency outright, as in Thailand, or practising “masterly inactivity”, essentially delaying making any moves that might legitimise <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> and the industries that would then arise around them. In this regulatory vacuum, banks have been able to protect themselves against the threat of the bankless payment system that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> represent.

                                If you’re confused by food labels, you’re not alone. But don’t hold your breath for an at-a-glance food labelling system that tells you how much salt, fat and sugar each product contains. Australia’s proposed “health star rating” labelling scheme was put on hold in February, following pressure from the food industry. And it’s unclear whether the scheme will go ahead. Marketers use a variety of tricks to make foods seem healthier and more appealing than their competitors, particularly when it comes to products aimed at children. One of the most powerful advertising tools a food manufacturer has is the packaging, as it’s what we look at immediately before deciding which food to purchase. Next time you’re shopping for food, look out for these seven common labelling tricks: The colour of food packaging can influence our perceptions of how healthy a food is. A recent study found consumers’ perceptions of two identical chocolate bars were influenced by the colour of the nutrition label; despite the identical calorie information, people perceived the one with the green label to be healthier. Another tool of savvy food marketers is the use of “ticks” and “seals” that we subconsciously process as indicating that the product has met some form of certification criteria. A recent study found that nutrition seals on unhealthy food products increased perceptions of healthiness among restrained eaters. And a study with parents of toddlers found 20% of parents identified the presence of a quality seal as one of the reasons for their purchase of toddler formula rather than cow’s milk. Food packaging often contains words that imply the food contains certain ingredients, or has been prepared in a way, that makes it healthier (or at least better than similar foods). But many of the words – such as “healthy” or “natural” – have no legal or formal meaning. While the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Code regulates the use of specific health and nutrient content claims, it doesn’t regulate or define these loose terms. “Weasel claims” describe modifiers that negate the claims that follow them. This allows manufacturers to avoid allegations of breaching advertising or labelling regulations, while being such a commonly used word that it is overlooked by the consumer. For example, Activia “can” help to reduce digestive discomfort - but did you read the fine print? It “can” help if you eat it twice a day and “… as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle”. Similarly, Berri Super Juice contains antioxidants which “help” fight free radicals (but so does whole fruit, which also contains more fibre). Unfinished claims tell us the product is better than something – but not better than what. In food labelling, we really have to hunt for the “what”. Fountain’s Smart Tomato Sauce still contains 114mg of salt per serving, while the brand’s regular tomato sauce contains 186mg (more than several other brands). The Heart Foundation defines low-salt foods as those with less than 120mg per 100g; Fountain’s Smart tomato sauce has 410mg per 100ml. It does, however, have less sugar than many of its competitors. So, if you are trying to reduce your sugar intake it may be a good choice, but if you are trying to reduce your sodium intake, look for one of the low-salt varieties and read the label very carefully (reduced is rarely synonymous with low). Smiths' Thinly Cut potato chips contain 75% less fat than “chips cooked in 100% Palmolein Oil”. But they don’t contain less fat than Original Thins, Kettle, or most other brands on the market. It’s also worth taking a close look at the recommended serving size – in both cases the nutrition information is based on a 27g serving, but Smiths' “single serve” pack is 45g (15.7g fat; one-fifth of an average adult’s recommended daily intake, or RDI). A common strategy is to list a claim that is, in itself, completely true – but to list it in a way that suggests that this product is unique or unusual (when in reality it is no different to most foods in that category). “All natural” and “no artificial colours and flavours” are appealing features for parents looking for snacks for their children. But most standard cheeses (including many packaged products such as cheese slices) also contain no artificial colours of flavours. This is not to suggest that Bega Stringers are a bad product or that you shouldn’t buy them – just that you may want to think about the cost per serve compared to other cheeses that are equally healthy. Like most lolly snakes, Starburst snakes are “99% fat free”. The old adage of “salt-sugar-fat” holds here; products that are low (or absent) in one are typically very high in another. In the case of lollies, it’s sugar. As with the potato chips above, serving size is important. Those of us who can’t resist more than one snake might be surprised to realise that if we ate half the bag, we would have consumed two-thirds of our daily sugar intake (although we can’t blame the pack labelling for that!). Sun-Rice Naturally Low GI White Rice illustrates this use of technically correct claims. Let’s start with “cholesterol free” – this is totally true, but all rice is cholesterol free. The pack also states in very large, bright blue letters that it is “Low GI”. In much smaller letters that almost disappear against the colour of the package is the word “naturally”. This use of different colours to attract, or not attract, attention is a common marketing technique. The product is indeed low GI, at 54 it is just below the cut-off of less than 55. But the “naturally” refers to the fact that what makes it low GI is the use of basmati rice rather than another variety, and other brands’ basmati rice would have a similar GI. Berri Super Juice proudly, and truthfully, claims it “contains no added sugar”. You may conclude from this that the sugar content is low, but a closer look at the nutrition information label may surprise you – a 200ml serve of this super juice contains 25.8g of sugar (29% of your recommended daily allowance). While contentious, some have even suggested that there is a link between fruit juice and both obesity and metabolic disease, particularly for children. A better (and cheaper) way of obtaining the fruit polyphenols is to eat fruit. Healthy sounding words are not only used as “claims” but are often used as brand names. This first struck me when I was looking for a snack at my local gym and noticed the “Healthy Cookies” on display; they had more sugar, more fat and less fibre than all of the others on sale (Healthy Cookies was the brand name). Brand names are often seen as a key descriptor of the nature of the product. Research has found that people rate food as healthy or unhealthy based on pre-existing perceptions of the healthiness of a product category or descriptor, particularly among those who are watching their diet, and may thus select the unhealthier option based on its name or product category. If, for example, you’re watching your weight, you may be attracted to the Go Natural <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Gluten">Gluten</a></span> Free Fruit & Nut Delight bar, assuming that it will be a healthier choice than a candy bar. But you might be surprised to note that it contains 932 kJ (11.0% of your RDI) and a whopping 13.6g of fat (10% of your RDI). A 53g Mars bar contains slightly more calories (1020kJ) but a lot less fat (9.1g), although the Go Natural bar could argue for “healthier” fat given the 40% nut content. So, can we really distinguish between healthy and unhealthy foods by looking at the wrappers? The healthiest wrappers are made by nature, from the simple ones that can be eaten after washing (like apples and carrots) to those that need some disposal (like a banana or a fresh corn cob). If you are buying your food wrapped in plastic or paper, it’s a little more complex. We need to see past the colours, pictures and cleverly-crafted claims and take a careful look at the ingredients and nutrition panel.

                                Free, unencrypted wireless is everywhere, but you shouldn't be checking your bank account on it unless you don’t mind somebody else snooping. The solution? A virtual private network, or VPN. A VPN extends your own private network into public places, so even if you’re using Starbucks' Wi-Fi connection, your Internet browsing stays encrypted and secure. There are plenty of ways to set up a VPN, both with free and paid services, but each solution has its own pros and cons, determined by the way the VPN provider operates and charges and the kinds of VPN options it provides.  The easiest and cheapest solution to keep your data safe is to just abstain from public Wi-Fi completely. But that sounds a little extreme to me when it’s relatively simple and inexpensive to build your own VPN server at home, and run it off of a tiny, inexpensive ($35) Raspberry Pi.  See also: Raspberry Pi: Everything You Need To Know My Raspberry Pi is about the size of a smartphone, but it runs a fully functional VPN server. That means no matter where I am, I can connect my computer to my home network and access shared files and media over a secure connection. It came in handy on a recent trip to Boston, where I was still able to watch videos stored on my network back home in DC.   This is the part where I’d link you to a handy tutorial on how to set this up. The problem is one doesn't exist—or at least one that could satisfy this average computer user. And while there are plenty of tutorials about how to set up a VPN server on Raspberry Pi, there are very few that explain why.  I read several different tutorials and cobbled together the results into this semi-coherent tutorial for setting up a VPN on Raspberry Pi, which even I can understand, complete with the why behind the how. So follow me down the cryptography rabbit hole and learn that no matter how paranoid you are, whoever came up with the methods to generate VPNs was even more so.   Materials Hardware Raspberry Pi Model B: Plus everything that comes with it—by that, I mean a regular power source and a case to put it in. A case can help prevent accidental short-circuits that could permanently damage the machine—the case can even be as simple as a cardboard box you fold yourself. SD card: I’m suggesting 8GB or more, just to make sure you have the space. As always for all Raspberry Pi projects, this should already have NOOBS installed.  Cat5e cable: This will connect the Pi’s ethernet port to the ethernet port on the router.  Software Open VPN: This is the open source VPN service we’ll be installing today.  Pre-Project Requirements 1) You need to set up NOOBS and install Raspbian. I wrote a step-by-step for this in my quantified fish tank tutorial, so you can refer to it there.  See also: 5 Pointers To Supercharge Your Raspberry Pi Projects 2) You need a static IP address for the Raspberry Pi on your home network. This depends on the model of your router, so use the instructions provided by the router’s manufacturer. If you don’t already have this set up, read ReadWrite’s tutorial.   3) You'll need SSH enabled. We’ll be connecting to the Raspberry Pi with SSH, a connection tool that lets us access the Pi from another computer. This way, we don’t need to set up the Pi to a monitor and wireless keyboard for this project. Once again, check ReadWrite’s tutorial.  4) You'll need to forward port 1194 (UDP traffic) to your Raspberry Pi’s internal IP address, but the way you do this will vary depending on your router, so check with your router manufacturer’s information. If you want to use another port or TCP, that’s fine, but just be sure to change 1194 in the tutorial to the correct number for you, and anywhere it says "UDP" to "TCP." You guessed it, there's a ReadWrite tutorial for this, too. You can tell we’re building off of some more basic Raspberry Pi concepts, which is why building a VPN with Raspberry Pi isn't a good first project for most beginners.  A Quick Word Of Caution I've pasted the actual code I used to complete this project, but when going back through the tutorial myself, I noticed that copying and pasting the code from the article onto the command line often results in errors due to spacing and formatting. If you are having a problem with any step of this tutorial, my first troubleshooting suggestion is to rewrite the command manually!  First Steps 1) Boot up and change your password. If you’re still using the default username (pi) and password (raspberry), it makes the rest of this security project totally pointless!  Open up a terminal/PuTTY window and type: sudo passwd Change the username and password to something strong and memorable (Microsoft offers some tips), otherwise why bother building a private network?  2) Now let’s be safe and update the Raspberry Pi. There are two commands you want to input:  sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade This shouldn’t take long, and it’ll save us a troubleshooting step later on.  3) Next we need the open source software. Type:  sudo apt-get install openvpn The Raspberry Pi is going to ask if you’re sure, since it uses up a bit of space. But since we prepared by getting an 8GB or bigger SD card, we’re totally fine.  Generating Keys 4) You don’t want anyone who finds your VPN server address to be able to connect. So next, we’re going to make a key for the server address. It’s just like keeping the door to your house locked.  OpenVPN comes with Easy_RSA, a light and easy package for using the RSA encryption method. Developed in 1977, RSA was one of the first usable cryptosystems that is still used today. The encryption key is public, while the decryption key is secret. If you’ve read anything about how <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> works, this might sound a bit familiar.  With Easy_RSA, you run an algorithm that comes with the software to generate a new unique key.  So first, let’s give ourselves superuser privileges. You’ll know it’s working when the command line prompt switches from “pi@raspberrypi” to “root@raspberrypi.” sudo -s This command creates another instance of the window we’re working in, but with root privileges. The reason we need to do this is because if we don’t, the Raspberry Pi will try and tell us we don’t have permission to mess around with making keys.  So next, we type: cp –r /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa  Here, “cp” stands for copy and “-r” stands for recursive (having to do with smaller instances, too). That means we’re telling the computer, “Copy this directory and everything underneath it.”  The space between /2.0 and /etc means we’re copying the first address (an example file) into the second folder, which is where you’ll tell OpenVPN to find your keys.  cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa  5) Next, we need to cd, or change directory, to the place we just moved the Easy_RSA file. Once there, we need to open the file /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars for editing. We could do that by writing nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars, but since we’re in the folder, there’s a shortcut: nano vars Nano is a built-in editing tool on Raspbian, and while there are others out there for more tech-savvy people, we’re just going to use nano for all our text editing in this tutorial.  Now, find and change EASY_RSA variable to:  export EASY_RSA=”/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa”  For me, it was on line 13.   Why make this change? Basically, you’re answering the computer’s question, “Where do you want the file to go to?” We want it to export to the same folder where we will keep our keys—in this case, the top level of the easy-rsa file tree.  There’s one extra thing you can do in vars if you’re paranoid about the Illuminati reading your email—change the encryption method from 1024-bit to 2048-bit. The document literally says, “increase this to 2048 if you are paranoid.”   But since that method makes keys take way longer to generate, we’re not doing it here. We’ll keep it looking like the text below: export KEY_SIZE=1024 Type Control+X to save your changes and exit the nano editor.  Getting Cryptographic 6) It’s time to build the CA Certificate and Root CA certificate.  In cryptography, a certificate authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates. The digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key. You probably use this all the time and don’t even know it. For example, when I log into my bank account, I see an HTTPS in front of the address. If I click on the lock, I see that a company called GeoTrust verified my bank website’s legitimacy, so I know it's not a phishing scam. (Of course, the recent Heartbleed bug revealed that HTTPS isn't the security measure we all used to think it was.) See also: What You Need To Know About Heartbleed, A Really Major Bug That Short-Circuits Web Security In the case of Raspberry Pi, I’m acting as my own certificate authority and signing off on the OpenVPN keys myself, instead of trusting it to a third party company.  cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa   Now that we’ve changed directories, type each of these lines one after another: source ./vars → This “sources” or loads the vars document you edited earlier. ./clean-all → This will remove any previous keys, if there are any. If you have keys you don’t want to remove in this folder (like you’re doing this tutorial a second time), skip this command.  ./build-ca → This final line builds your certificate authority. After the third command, the Raspberry Pi is going to shoot back with a bunch of optional fields for you to fill out if you want to—Country Name, State or Province Name, Locality Name, Organization Name, Organizational Unit, Common Name, Name, and Email Address. If you don't care to fill out these fields, just hit “enter” each instance to have the Pi fill in the default value. The screenshot below shows what that looks like: Now you can name the server. I creatively named mine “Server.” Call it whatever you want, but don’t forget it: ./build-key-server [Server_Name]  Once again, the Pi is going to spit out some optional fields. Press enter or whatever you want, but pay attention to these three fields:   Common Name MUST be the server name you picked. It should default to this. A challenge password? MUST be left blank. Sign the certificate? [y/n] Obviously, you must type “y.” You’ll get a message that says the certificate will be certified for 3,650 more days. So basically if you use your VPN long enough, you’ll have to do this process again in 10 years. 1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n] Obviously, type “y.” 6) That’s the server side setup. Now it’s time to build keys for each user, or "client." I have five keys at home—one for each computer, tablet, and cell phone in the house. It’s possible to be lazy and create just one client key for all of them, but in that case, only one device would be able to access the VPN at a time.   ./build-key-pass UserName  I found it simplest to make the usernames Client1, Client2, Client3…  And after that, more prompts!  Enter PEM pass phrase Make it a password you will remember! It asks you to input this twice, so there’s no danger of ruining it.  A challenge password? MUST be left blank. Sign the certificate? [y/n] Signing certifies it for 10 more years. cd keys openssl rsa -in Client1.key -des3 -out Client1.3des.key  The important takeaway from this string of text is that we’re using des3 encryption, in which a complex encryptionalgorithm that's applied three times to each data block to keep hackers from breaking through it with brute force. OpenSSL stands for an open source implementation of Secure Socket Layer, a standard method of setting up a secure connection. You need to perform this step for every client you set up.  Some argue this step is unnecessary, and that you could simply skip this line. But if you’re running OpenVPN Connect clients on Android or iOS, this needs to be done. Otherwise, current versions could have difficulty parsing the keys you just generated.  Enter pass phrase for Client1.key Honestly, I just used the same passphrase as before. And then two more times, as shown. Now that we’ve created a server certificate and (at least one) client certificate, type the following:  cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/  OR cd ..  Either way, the computer will take you up one directory, back to /easy-rsa/.  7) Now let’s generate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This is the central code that makes your VPN server tick, an exchange that lets two entities with no prior knowledge of one another share secret keys over a public server. Like RSA, it’s one of the earliest cryptosystems out there.   ./build-dh This could take a while, longer if you’re on 2048-bit encryption. There’s no way really to predict how long it will take because it is using random numbers and looking for some specific relationships. In fact, while I was making this tutorial, it only took 5 minutes with 1024-bit encryption. 8) Finally, we’re going to implement OpenVPN’s build-in Denial of Service (DoS) attack protection. You might already know that a DoS attack is successful when a hacker finds out your server’s address, and generates such a large number of access requests that your server crashes.  OpenVPN has a way to prevent this kind of attack from occurring before it even starts by generating a static pre-shared hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) key. With this in place, the server won't even entertain the idea of authenticating an access request unless it detects this static key first. Thus, a hacker can’t just spam the server with random repeated requests.  Generate the static HMAC key with the following line: openvpn –-genkey –-secret keys/ta.key Putting It All Together 9) We’ve generated keys and a Certificate Authority to sign them. What we’re still missing are the settings to tell OpenVPN how we want this server configured. The OpenVPN program is already running. The problem is, it doesn’t know which keys to use, where you’re going to be connecting from, what kind of connection you’re building, or which IP address and port to use.  Since we’re using Linux on a Raspberry Pi, there’s no graphical user interface (GUI) for telling OpenVPN what it needs to know. That’s why we have to actually create a .conf (configuration) file in the nano editor off of the command line.  nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf  The reason we’re starting this address with /etc/openvpn is so it will end up in the openvpn folder. But for now, this file is completely blank. Fill it in with this. I commented in all caps where you absolutely need to change numbers and titles to your own IP address/names. Hit Control+X to save your changes.  10) Let’s quickly edit another configuration file. By default, Raspbian does not forward Internet traffic. We need to edit another file to allow the Pi to forward Internet traffic through our new network.  nano /etc/sysctl.conf Near the top it says, “Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4.” I've highlighted that part of the file in the screenshot below.  To uncomment the line, remove the # immediately in front of it. This is setting up the configuration so it knows to forward to IPv4. Now that you’ve uncommented this line, the Pi has permission to act as a relay on the Internet instead of just a receiver, by both sending and receiving packets.  Hit Control+X to save your changes. Apply these changes by typing the following command: sysctl -p  The sysctl command “configures kernel parameters at runtime.” The -p tells it to reload the file with the changes you just made.  11) We just made a functioning server that can access the Internet. But we can’t use it yet because Raspbian has a built-in firewall that will block incoming connections.  Raspbian has a firewall to protect your Raspberry Pi from unknown and unexpected Internet sources. We still want the firewall to protect us from most incoming and outgoing network traffic, but we need to poke an OpenVPN-shaped hole in the firewall.  Additionally, Raspbian’s firewall configuration resets by default when you reboot the Pi. We want to make sure it remembers the OpenVPN connection is always permitted, so what we’re going to do is create a simple script which runs on boot: nano /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh This is currently a blank shell executable file. Fill it with this: #!/bin/sh  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.XX.X Don’t forget to change the default IP address to your Pi’s IP address! Let’s break this down: 10.8.0.0 is the default address for Raspberry Pi for clients that are connected to the VPN. "eth0" stands for ethernet port. Switch this to "wlan0" if you’re on a wireless connection, which is not recommended. Hit Control+X to save your changes.   As a safety measure, files you create are not executable by default, so we’ll need to change the permissions and ownership of /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh. First we’ll change the mode to 700 (owner can read, write, and execute). Then, we’ll change the owner to root, in which “root” is Linux’s standard name for the superuser.  chmod 700 /etc/firewall-Openvpn-rules.sh  chown root /etc/firewall-Openvpn-rules.sh 12) We’ve created the script that punches an OpenVPN-shaped hole in the firewall. Now we just need to inject it into the interfaces setup code so it runs on boot.  nano /etc/network/interfaces Find the line that goes: “iface eth0 inet dhcp.” We want to add a line below it at an indent. So this is what the two lines, existing and new, will look like when you’re done: iface eth0 inet dhcp pre-up /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh Hit Control+X to save your changes (as you should be doing whenever you use nano).  Finally, finally, finally: Reboot your Pi.  sudo reboot See also: Building A Raspberry Pi VPN Part Two: Creating An Encrypted Client Side Congratulations!

Near the end of last year, when its price was above $1,000, more than 100,000 coins were being traded daily on BTC China, a local exchange.Alas, those heady days are gone. Prices have plunged below $500 of late and hardly 2,000 coins are now traded daily on BTC China. According to Bobby Lee, the exchange’s founder, “Most investors have left the market.” What happened? The short answer is regulation.In early December China’s central bank declared that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was not a currency. This slowed its rise, but enthusiasts remained unbowed as the declaration fell far short of the outright ban some had feared.

                                The pace of technology innovation has been on a tear over the last two decades, as The Economist recently highlighted. Built on open protocols like TCP/IP and accessed through open-source browsers like Mozilla Firefox, the Web has given rise to Google, Facebook, Wikipedia and more. Freedom has been kind to innovation. That freedom, however, is now under siege. Bluntly stated, the curated mobile experience is killing the Web, app by app, leaving us with a sheltered but increasingly sterile environment for experimentation.  We Prefer Apps To Innovation We don't really have anyone to blame but ourselves. In large part, since the native app experience has been superior to mobile web browsing, users gravitate toward apps in a big way, as recent Flurry data makes clear: This jibes with Nielsen data released earlier this year that shows users spend 89% of their time on media in apps, versus just 11% through the Web. While I personally spend as much time in my Chrome browser as I do in apps like Facebook or Twitter, I might be the exception to the mobile rule.  This shift to apps, innocuous as it may appear, will have far-reaching consequences. After all, while anyone could build anything on the Web, the rules for apps are much more tightly controlled, as Andreessen Horowitz investor and Web luminary Chris Dixon warns: Apps are heavily controlled by the dominant app stores owners, Apple and Google. Google and Apple control what apps are allowed to exist, how apps are built, what apps get promoted, and charge a 30% tax on revenues. Most worrisome: they reject entire classes of apps without stated reasons or allowing for recourse (e.g. Apple has rejected all apps related to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>). Users may like the safety of a well-tended app store, but it comes with serious risks to innovation. Union Squares Ventures general partner Fred Wilson confirms this: Upon reviewing the investments his firm has made over the last 10 years (including Twitter, Tumblr, Zynga, Etsy, Boxee and more), he worries the most recent investments, coming in the shadow of the app boom, suggest that "it has gotten harder, not easier, to innovate on the Internet with the smartphone emerging as the platform of choice vs the desktop browser." (Don't) Think Different We can't blame the almighty app for this trend entirely; after all, the Web has been under attack from centralization for some time now. Google, which keeps a tight rein on mobile innovation through its Android platform, has also spent years corralling the Wild West of the open Web into a systematized "stack" that includes Gmail, YouTube, Search and more. But Google isn't alone. Bruce Sterling, a noted futurist, describes the "stackification" of the web in this way: Stacks. In 2012 it made less and less sense to talk about "the Internet," "the PC business," "telephones," "Silicon Valley," or "the media," and much more sense to just study Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. These big five American vertically organized silos are re-making the world in their image.   We look back on the early Internet and laugh at how CompuServe was ever a thing—that so many people happily used the curated AOL garden. Today, we're madly dashing back into these gated communities. But nowhere more so than on our smartphones. HTML5 And Blockchain To The Rescue? There are two reasons to remain optimistic about mobile. The first is HTML5, the development platform that, in theory, makes the mobile web look/feel/act more like native apps. While its promise has always underperformed against reality, HTML5 is good and getting better. It also continues to be the third-most interesting platform to developers: As Google continues to learn how apps are a serious threat to its search business—difficult to impossible to access content within them—it will hopefully double down on HTML5.  But the brighter hope may be Blockchain. Blockchain, the open source engine on which <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is built, is, as TechCrunch's Jon Evans explains, "a new kind of distributed consensus system that allows transactions, or other data, to be securely stored and verified without any centralized authority at all, because... they are validated by the entire network." It sounds complex, but it means the server farms that centralize so much power in Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Amazon could one day be replaced by massive distributed peer-to-peer networks. These would be open networks, just like the Internet used to be, and this level of openness would, in turn, breed innovation: I'm glad that most disruptive and exciting new platform (no, not Oculus) - the blockchain - is open source and not for sale. — Adam Ludwin (@adamludwin) March 26, 2014 Building The Future On Blockchain How Blockchain translates to mobile remains to be seen. But arguably we'll see a decentralization of control as inventors route around the gated communities of Apple and Google with Blockchain-based distribution strategies. For the moment, Apple seems determined to keep <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> out of its App Store, but that's a momentary setback, and not directly relevant. Blockchain isn't about trading <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=virtual currency">virtual currency</a></span>. No, it's much bigger than that. It's about an open, unfettered platform for innovation.

                                With the deadline of financial spring cleaning looming large, it's only natural to panic at the hopeless money morass you're wading through. Or maybe you're on your financial game but looking for a more granular way to keep tabs on your bank accounts, credit, investments and loans. Maybe what you really need is more data—that, and the best tools to manage it and your finances. Arming yourself so you can watch and execute every aspect of your financial life is empowering—and if you believe tha more data is better than less (and for the most part you should), it's extremely satisfying, too. Here are our favorite apps for managing all things money. Make Budgeting (Almost) Fun: Mint Mint is the reigning king of online money management—and with good reason. Mint makes keeping an eye on transactions across all of your accounts useful at-a-glance, and scanning individual account information is as easy as clicking a drop-down menu.  You can go as deep as you want, tagging individual transactions like work expenses, searching across all accounts at once, pooling your account histories all in one place (extremely useful for tracking when Comcast hikes up your bill, for example) and showing you where your cash goes. Mint offers a bit of basic financial planning too, with tips on saving and customizable notifications for high spending. If you’ve heard a ton about it but haven’t checked it our for yourself, Mint manages to live up to its excellent reputation. Download Mint. Best Bird’s Eye View: Manilla While it seems like a direct Mint competitor at first gloss, the two apps complement each other well. Like Mint, Manilla offers an overview of all of your accounts, but it adds some unique features into the mix. You can link up all kinds of accounts to Manilla, including billing accounts for utilities and phone service, travel rewards memberships, and media subscriptions like Netflix and The New York Times. The idea is that by getting all of your bills and memberships in one place, you won’t get slammed with late fees. If you opt to authorize it, you can view your bills on Manilla and auto-login to connected accounts to pay them easily. Download Manilla. Your Credit Score Gets Less Scary: Credit Karma Credit Karma makes it easy to view and monitor your credit—and it does it for free. Checking your credit score is a notoriously difficult process that many people only undertake on an annual basis, if at all, because it’s just that annoying. With Credit Karma, it's as simple as logging into the app, which updates your score weekly. Credit Karma isn’t perfect—its scores, provided by Transunion, don’t always match up with the official FICO score used by most lenders. But it usually tracks FICO pretty closely, and with a lot less hassle. Our favorite feature is that the service explains the factors that go into your current credit score and how to improve them. Credit Karma transforms checking your credit score from a dreaded once-a-year ritual to a daily habit, and that’s pretty empowering. Download Credit Karma for iOS/Android. 9 More Awesome Personal Finance Apps  Square Cash: Send money through email easily with no fees. Yahoo Finance: Keep tabs on the market with Yahoo's attractively redesigned iOS app. Betterment: Tend your investment portfolio. Evernote: Save and search receipts, bills and just about anything. Splitwise: Split and pay shared bills easily. Personal Cap: If "wealth management" sounds more your speed than divvying up a Netflix subscription. Check: Another option for getting your bills paid like a boss. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Checker (Android)/Coin Ticker (iOS): If you're crazy (like a fox?) enough to hold any crypto-currencies, here's a convenient way to keep tabs on what they're worth in the world of old-fashioned money.  A word on security: If you’re going to get into the business of mobile banking, take every security precaution at your disposal. Choosing unique, strong passwords is a must and opting for two-factor authentication whenever possible is a good idea too. Enable services like that lock down your device should it get lost or stolen. Protect yourself as you revel in the ease of mobile banking—and pay your bills on time, too.  Header image by Taylor Hatmaker

                                In countries that have based their wealth on production, every discovery and innovation that potentially lower production costs attract very strong attention. Since 2007, the discovery and exploitation of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil have put the USA energy industry back on the track to competitive procurement faced with competing nations who have been low costs champions for decades. The new question on the table is to ascertain whether 3D printing can have a comparable impact. [This is a content summary only.
