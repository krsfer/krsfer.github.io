                                One of us: an exclusive club.Lilongd, CC BY-SA In the European Union, the European Citizen’s Initiative was set up with the aim of bringing the activities of the European Parliament closer to the citizens of Europe. If a petition can achieve 1m signatures from across at least seven member states, the European Commission, which devises common policies, is obliged to consider the proposal and a legal framework to allow it to happen. One of the most successful of these ECIs achieved the requisite 1m signatures late last year under the tagline of “a beautifully simple step but could help save millions of lives.” But this ECI was anything but beautiful and threatened to endanger the lives of thousands of women worldwide. As we wrote, when it first appeared in 2012 the ECI said: The human embryo deserves respect to its dignity and integrity. This is enounced by the European Court of Justice in the Brüstle case, which defines the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should establish a ban and end the financing of activities which presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid and public health. If successful the ECI had the potential to severely restrict human embryonic <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cell">stem cell</a></span> research within the EU. But more worrying is the impact that it could have had on the lives of women in countries in receipt of EU development aid; the countries where maternal mortality and morbidity are higher than those we consider acceptable within the EU, and where access to safe and legal abortion is a basic health need. If successful it would have directly challenged fundamental rights of women and been in direct conflict with the aims of UN Millennium Development Goal five: to improve maternal health. “One of Us”, the name of the campaign behind the proposal, was able to harness the infrastructure of the Roman Catholic Church, complete with an endorsement by Pope Benedict XVI, to gather signatures from across ten member states. Other Christian groups also back the campaign. Weak legal basis In early April this year the co-ordinators of this ECI had the opportunity to present their arguments to Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and Andris Piebalgs, the EU commissioners for research and development aid repectively. A month later the commission officially responded to the ECI and – thankfully for women’s and human rights – rejected the premises upon which it was based and declined to consider a legislative proposal that might give effect to it. As noted in the response, the legal basis for this ECI was weak from the start. It purported to draw from the decision in the case of Oliver Brüstle v Greenpeace in defining the human embryo as existing from the moment of conception for the purposes of legal protection. This case required the court to consider how embryos are defined in a commercial setting for the purposes of patenting and intellectual property. But this claim deliberately overlooked the fact that the decision in the Brüstle case was concerned solely with the issue of patentability. As such it specifically did not, and was not an attempt to, provide a precedent for a more wide-ranging definition of legal personhood or serve as a comment on whether human embryonic <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cell">stem cell</a></span> research is permissible or something that should be funded. Europe’s very own ‘gag rule’ “One of Us” is modelled on a restriction, introduced by the Ronald Reagan in 1984, often called “the global gag.” This is a prohibition on organisations that receive US government funding from facilitating access to abortion services or any advocates for the liberalisation of domestic abortion policy. This restriction applies even if the organisation provides a broad range of sexual and reproductive health services and obtains its funding for abortion services from another source. The “global gag” has been endorsed by every Republican president since Reagan and rescinded by every Democratic president. The gag applies in countries where abortion is legal (neither US nor EU development aid is used to fund access to abortion where the procedure is illegal). The impact of the global gag has been measured by several organisations including the World Health Organisation, the Guttmacher Institute, and Population Action International and, unsurprisingly, they’ve found that it has increased the number of unplanned pregnancies and abortions because of the impact it has had on family planning and contraceptive care more generally. It has also had significant and negative impact on the lives of real women in countries where access to safe abortion is a legal and necessary part of abortion care. Campaigns like One of Us are not a “beautifully simple step” to saving millions of lives. They are moves intended to disadvantage and marginalise women; sadly often those most in need of assistance – women in developing countries are “one of us” and should be treated as such. It also highlights the potential negative impacts for which the seemingly benign citizen’s initiatives, like popular petitions, can be co-opted by other interested groups. Importantly it is a mechanism that some believe will be used again in the furtherance of conservative aims. It was always likely that this initiative would fail from a legal perspective, however, a primary objective was not success but the creation of “a new Europe-wide mobilisation of the pro-life movement.” It is for this reason that it’s important to pay attention to the success of the initiative – in its own terms even if it did not formally succeed.

                                Is climate change good or bad news for sea turtles?djblock99/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA You might have seen in recent news that climate change may increase the size of some sea turtle populations, by increasing the number of female turtles. These studies hinge on an unusual trait of sea turtles: their sex is determined by the temperature in the nest. Turtle eggs incubated above 29C produce mostly females, while temperatures under 29C produce mostly males. Our recent study published in Nature Climate Change found that by altering the sex ratio of turtle populations in favour of females, climate change could lead to a population increase in the short term. But this isn’t the whole story. Warmer eggs make more females The study found that rising temperatures might alter sex ratios and increase the size of some sea turtle populations. Sea turtles are unusual in that the sex of hatchlings is determined, not by sex chromosomes (as is the case in humans and other mammals), but by incubation temperature, a phenomenon known as temperature-dependent sex determination. Above a certain pivotal incubation temperature of 29C, the majority of sea turtle eggs produce female hatchlings, and vice versa. This pivotal temperature holds broadly for all sea turtle species and has presumably evolved to produce optimally balanced sex ratios. So warming temperatures may cause the feminisation of sea turtle populations through the production of only female hatchlings. Previous studies have highlighted how, all else being equal, this feminisation effect might lead to population extinctions. However, while this threat of feminisation of sea turtle populations has been known for many years, there had previously been few attempts to predict how the sex ratio of populations may change in the future, and the resulting extinction risk. Loggerhead turtle Dr Gail Schofield, Swansea University The study, undertaken by an international team including scientists from Deakin University in Warrnambool (Australia) and Swansea University (UK) took place in one of the world’s largest sea turtle rookeries, the Cape Verde Islands in the Atlantic, where large numbers of loggerhead turtles breed. It recorded sand temperatures on nesting beaches over several years using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=small data">small data</a></span>-loggers. These sand records were then combined with past measurements of environmental conditions on these islands since 1850, and climate predictions for the next 100 years made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this way a robust two hundred and fifty year time-series of incubation temperatures, hatchling sex ratios, and adult breeding sex ratios were derived. The research found that increased temperatures would lead to increased feminisation of the species, but entire feminisation would not be imminent in the next few decades. In fact, warm incubation temperatures may have a short-term conservation benefit on the turtles, increasing the number of breeding females and hence the total size of the population Climate change still bad for turtles However, the study is not complete. There is much more work to be done to understand how sea turtles will be affected by climate change. The study focused on one site in the Atlantic. There is a need to extend the study to further examine the threat of feminisation for sea turtles at their many other nesting sites around the world, including around the coast of Australia which is home to key populations of several species. By extending these analysis methods, we can objectively identify those areas where climate change and feminisation of populations are likely to be most acute. In this way we can have an early warning for where future management intervention may be required, for example, in the form a shading nests to ensure that males are produced. Loggerhead turtle Dr. Gail Schofield, Swansea University Further, as the number of males decreases, they are going to become ever more important and yet we know very little about them. Unlike females, male sea turtles do not come ashore and so are hard to study. While thousands of adult female turtles have been equipped with satellite tags, only a handful of adult males have been tracked. There is an important knowledge gap here. We have started to address this gap by catching male turtles at sea and equipping them with satellite tags. In this way we have collected data giving an indication that males may breed more frequently than females. This finding suggests that skewed female hatchling sex ratios will actually translate to more balanced sex ratios of breeding males and females. More studies of breeding intervals need to be undertaken across different species and in different breeding locations. So while the recent research provides some useful insights into how climate might impact sea turtles, a host of questions remain. The long-term prognosis for sea turtles in a warming world is not necessarily good. Graeme Hays receives funding from Deakin University and Swansea University.

                                The World Cup stimulates not only passion and nationalism, but reminiscence. The heroic 2-3 effort of the Socceroos against the Netherlands was the centre of many conversations this week, but will also be remembered for years in the future. My homeland, England’s, World Cup efforts are probably best not being raised in discussion. Memory for particular events has always fascinated me – why are certain events remembered in more detail than others? Are these specific memories less susceptible to be forgotten over time? People certainly have stronger memories for events that have an emotional aspect, and memories for sporting events can be particularly robust and vivid. Although you might struggle to recall what you did last weekend, when it comes to sport, particular events can be remembered with incredible precision. For people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, the loss of memories has a devastating impact on their health, well-being and sense of self. As of 2013, there were an estimated 44.4 million people with dementia worldwide. Every week, 1,700 new cases of dementia are diagnosed in Australia. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form, affecting up to 70% of all people diagnosed with dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is characterised by damage to the brain in the form of amyloid plaques that form outside neurons, and neurofibrillary tangles made of dysfunctional tau protein inside neurons. This two-pronged attack prevents neurons from communicating with each other effectively across synapses and starves the neurons of nutrients. This results in the death of neurons, leading to loss of brain matter. With fewer neurons, encoding new memories is less effective. Short-term memory loss is one of the first symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s patients often formulate ways of disguising this kind of memory loss, putting it down to forgetfulness and using memory <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span> such as making lists. But as the disease progresses to deeper parts of the brain, long-term memory is also lost. These long-term memories include fundamental knowledge about patient’s past – the names of their close family and significant events such as details of their wedding. The loss of these intrinsic memories not only devastates family members, but creates frustration and distress in Alzheimer’s patients, leading to depression and withdrawal. The beautiful game Recently, the project Football Memories in Scotland has shown that discussing soccer with other fans can help stimulate the recollections of some people who suffer from dementia. Soccer is an international sport, uniting communities with shared passion. Sports like soccer act as a thread running through the lives of many people, tying together important events in a fan’s life and connecting them to other enthusiasts. Using visual cues with dementia patients – such as team photos, can stimulate avid discussion and also stir the recollection of memories that may otherwise be overlooked. Recollected memories are highly detailed – remembering specific matches, goals and incidents. Moreover, these memories contain important information regarding the circumstances and features surrounding the recalled sporting events – locations, time of year, the people you were with and how you were feeling at the time. For dementia patients, group sessions and one to one discussions with other fans can stimulate extensive discussion and forge friendships across these shared interests. The memories have a robust emotional component and their vivid features provide dementia patients with a sense of empowerment, camaraderie and passion. Also, the recall of specific memories may strengthen the connections between remaining functional neurons (known as neuroplasticity) easing subsequent recall. Although these projects have not extended to Australia yet, this kind of passionate, image driven discussion can be integrated into conversations by carers of those affected by dementia. These interactions could greatly enhance the sense of self that is lost in those suffering from dementia.

                                If you follow my standard Twitter account, @LaurenInSpace, you’re missing out on the good stuff. @LaurenInEbooks is a computer-generated stream of garbled tweets that are often far more on point than what I actually have to say.  China is a wearable. Ramona the Love Terrier reports: — Otaku Journalist ebx (@LaurenInEbooks) May 23, 2014 A friend of mine, who knows about my love of esoteric Internet phenomena, built @LaurenInEbooks as a gift. It’s inspired by @horse_ebooks, a Twitter account so famous for its poorly computer-generated tweets that it got profiled in the New Yorker, which revealed that it had gone from a weird spam effort to sell ebooks into a mysterious art project. Horse_ebooks is an old joke by now. But it’s not too late for you to get in on this bizarre genre of word art. A computer-generated account which serves as your own personal Twitter bot Frankenstein is always fresh and funny. Plus, for beginning coders like me, this project is a great way to dip your toe into Python and Ruby while sharpening your Git skills—and at the end, get a hilarious little bot for your troubles.  See also: GitHub For Beginners: Don't Get Scared, Get Started Some of my coworkers wanted in join in on the fun, so I decided to build them some Twitter bots, too. However, I found the starter script I chose to use, Heroku Ebooks, significantly difficult to follow. Building on top of it, I decided to create a tutorial anybody can use. A caveat: I built this tutorial on a Mac using its Terminal app, software which provides direct access to running software programs. I have not tested this tutorial for Windows machines, but if you need help, start with GitHub’s Windows instructions.  It took me three tries to perfect the process. By the third time, building a bot took me only 20 minutes to complete! Here’s how to easily build your own random Twitter bot—and learn a little code at your friends’ expense.   Set Up A Twitter Account You’re going to need a place for these tweets to go, so build a new Twitter account with a funny name. If you add “ebooks” to the end, @horse_ebooks fans will instantly get the reference, but you can choose any variation you like. In order to verify the account, you’ll need an email address that isn’t already being used by Twitter, so I’d suggest a secondary email you rarely use. I just generated a new email address I’ll probably never check again over at my hosting service, Bluehost, but you can also sign up for a new one on Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or Outlook.com. This new Twitter account also MUST have a mobile number connected to it. I used Google Voice, since they give you your first number for free. If I needed another I might have used Twilio, which also gives you your first number for free. If you need to create a lot of accounts, Twilio will cost $1/month, which can add up fast. And I should also note that while Twitter allows you to create parody accounts, “mass account creation” is against the rules. Twitter also has rules on automated accounts which you should follow. So don’t go crazy with your bots.  This is also a good time to make a profile image. For @SelenaEbooks, I inverted the colors on her face to make a bizarro version of her Twitter image. I'm sure she just loves it. Set Up A Twitter Developer Account  While still logged into your new Twitter account, navigate over to dev.twitter.com. The first thing you want to do is create a new app. For convenience, use the same name as your new account. Once you’ve named and created your app, you’re going to immediately want to adjust its permissions to “Read and Write.” In order to post to Twitter from a program, it needs to have a mobile number connected to the account—which is why we needed to create one earlier.   Next, go to the API Keys page and click “Generate my Access Token,” and keep the window open while it works. You’ll need those keys and tokens in just a few minutes.  Clone The GitHub Repository Whenever you are working on a coding project, you are always standing on the shoulders of giants. In this case, we’re borrowing an open source Ruby and Python script that GitHub user Tom Meagher has saved in a repository.  You need a copy of Tom’s repository on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to hit “Clone In Desktop” or “Download Zip.” Either way, you want to take the resulting folder, which will be called heroku_ebooks, and store it in the very top directory of your computer. Update Your Settings Navigate to the heroku_ebooks folder on your computer, and open up local_settings_example.py. In a text editor, copy and paste the entire contents into a new document, which you’ll then save as local_settings.py. Fill in your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token Key, and Access Token Secret in the allotted spaces. If you’re unsure which those are, here’s a hint: they’re in exactly the same order as they appeared on dev.twitter.com.   Here are mine as they appear in order, though blurred out. Don’t ever share secret keys—that’s gotten Amazon Web Services customers in trouble! When it says to list the account, don’t write out the full Twitter account URL (twitter.com/selenaebooks) or even put an @ in front of the Twitter username (@selenaebooks). Here’s how I did the @SelenaEbooks account:   Note that I set both T/F (true/false) variables to FALSE. If the first one isn’t set this way, it won’t be able to write to Twitter.   Sign Up For And Install Heroku We’re going to create this app by installing a free app-developer program called Heroku. First, go to Heroku.com and sign up for an account. I know you may be reluctant to do this, but you’re going to need to have a “verified” account, and that means inputting your credit card information. I wish Heroku didn’t do it this way, but it’s necessary for later, and I've never been charged a cent.  Now that we’re signed up, here's the problem: Our heroku_ebooks program files are on our computer, not the Web. So we need to use Heroku on our computer. Download Heroku Toolbelt in order to do that.  Once Heroku is installed, go to your command-line window—in Terminal on the Mac, in the Windows command line on Windows machines. We need to build a Heroku app, but we want to make sure it builds in the right place.  cd heroku_ebooks  Once inside, we need to start up Git. For me, this was the most complicated part of the project. I kept getting an error where Git was unable to find my app, unless I typed exactly the following: git init git add . git commit -am "Add all files" heroku create --stack cedar git push heroku master With the first three lines, we’re setting up a fresh initialization of Git in this folder and told it to include and track the documents already located in this folder. Then, we’re using the “Heroku create” command to build a new app on the cedar stack. Celadon Cedar, or cedar for short, is a deployment environment for Heroku. It lets Heroku access libraries that allow it to understand Python, Ruby, and any other language you want to build apps with. Heroku has a nature-based naming convention, and it’ll randomly assign a name to your app based on that, in this case “damp-spire-9517.” You never have to change the name of the app since it won't show publicly—it'll just be how you identify it in your Heroku account. In this screenshot, I've moved on from making fun of my colleague Selena Larson and tackled my boss, Owen Thomas, with @OwenEbooks. With the final line, we’re pushing out all our heroku_ebooks files, including the local_settings.py file we built, to our Heroku app’s home on the Web. Heroku stores them in its servers and will run the app for us.  Note: if you made a mistake in local_settings.py and need to update it, it’s just like doing any other update in Git. First, change the file, save, and exit. Then, back on the command line: cd heroku_ebooks git add local_settings.py git commit -am “Update local_settings.py” git push heroku master You shouldn’t get this error if you’ve done everything the way I said, but the most common error is going to be:   !     Push rejected, no Cedar-supported app detected This means it can’t find a Heroku app in the heroku_ebooks folder. Remove and reinitialize Git with: rm -rf .git git init git add . Then try once more to create a new Heroku app in the folder.  If it is working, you’ll get this notice instead: -----> Python app detected  Once it’s done pushing changes to the master branch, you can test to see if it’s working: heroku run worker This will give you one of two responses:  1 No, sorry, not this time.  In this response, “1” could be any number 1 through 7, or, an actual tweet: If you get an error that the program is unable to write to Twitter, make sure you gave it read and write permission back in dev.twitter.com. That’s an early mistake I made. This program works as a random number generator. As a result, it seems like it takes forever to get “heroku run worker” to deliver anything. Ugh. If you get REALLY frustrated, you can raise its chances from 1 in 8 to 1 in 4, etc. on the ODDS line in local_settings.py. Schedule Tweets For The Future Once you’ve got your first tweet—a step you really should take to verify everything's working—you’ll want to schedule “heroku run worker” to run at regular intervals during the day, so you don’t have to manually tweet for it yourself. Type: heroku addons:add scheduler:standard If you didn’t “verify” your Heroku account with a credit card, this command won’t work. Go get that credit card! Otherwise, type this once the scheduler installs: heroku addons:open scheduler It’ll take you to a page on Heroku where you can configure the program. Name it “worker,” and set the frequency to “hourly.” Hit save. This is where the random number generator comes in. To keep the account from spamming Twitter, “heroku run worker” runs once an hour. But instead of tweeting every time, it’s actually rolling a die. Every 8th time or so, it hits gold. As a result, your randomizer accounts should update about three times a day. Enjoy your new Twitter bot, and be sure to share it with me in the comments!

                                EPA/Haim Zach Crises have their uses. If nothing else, they remind us how the international system works, who has power, and what’s at stake when things fall apart. The current, depressingly familiar, mayhem in Iraq provides a sobering reminder that even well-intentioned external powers may be able to do little to solve problems that have their roots in long-standing local rivalries. Even without an overlay of ethnic and religious tensions, Iraq’s problems defy easy resolution. As in so much of the world, the arbitrary boundaries laid down by former colonial powers bore little relationship to social facts on the ground. The widespread predilection for authoritarian solutions to the resulting struggle for order and cohesion was the all too predictable consequence of European imperialism and its dissolution. Plainly, ‘the West’ has much to answer for historically. One of the key questions now is what responsibility the current generation has in trying to atone for, let alone resolve, such troubling legacies. At what point does trying to make amends become unjustified and unwanted interference? Even if it is accepted that the so-called developed, undoubtedly dominant, and invariably democratic powers ought to do something what form could it possibly take? More pointedly, might it actually do more harm than good? These questions have assumed greater urgency as a consequence of a series of international crises that have come to a bloody head in Iraq. At such times there are inevitable expectations that the ‘international community’ ought to do something. These hopes are invariably unfulfilled for a very simple reason: there is not such thing as the international community. To be sure, if the number of times ideas are piously invoked is any measure of significance, the international community ought to be at the centre of international affairs. But when push comes to shove as it all too frequently does these days, the international community is conspicuous by it absence. At best the international community is a synonym for the usual suspects; a coterie of primarily western states whose strategic loyalties and normative predispositions generally align with those of the United States. Perhaps the international community’s most promising moment recently was in the first Gulf War, when a coalition of 34 nations led by the United States responded to Iraq’s invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Even then, however, this was a small fraction of the nearly 200 members of the United Nations. The contrast was the second conflict with Iraq, when a much smaller ‘coalition of the willing’ embarked on a catastrophically misjudged mission of regime change, is a painful reminder of the perils of hubris and an essentially unilateral approach to foreign policy. To guard against such disasters in the future, the creation of an effective international community might actually be a good idea for at least two reasons. First, being hegemonic is very agreeable, no doubt, but the weight of expectations that comes with it can be crippling at times. Whatever the US does in the current crisis only one thing is certain: not everyone will be happy. Even domestically, this is a no-win situation for an Obama administration judged to be weak and indecisive by its growing legion of critics. Internationally, the ‘great Satan’ is only likely to add to the list of its implacable enemies if it gets directly involved in the Middle East again. The second counterintuitive reason for actually creating an international community, therefore, is that it potentially relieves the US of the burdens and opprobrium that come with leadership. Even the it’s-all-about-oil arguments look far less convincing now that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> revolution is about to make the US energy independent. There is no immediate benefit for the US in intervening, other than stabilising – for the moment, at least – a region whose fate ultimately rests in its own hands. Despite the recent self-serving protestations of innocence from the likes of Dick Cheney and Tony Blair, few now think that invasion of Iraq was a worthwhile endeavour. A Bush administration that was constrained by international opinion and better advised by more independently-minded allies might not have embarked on such an egregious folly, and we might have avoided the horrors that are unfolding as a direct consequence. It is easy to be wise after the event, of course, but it is striking how some of the same misguided arguments are being recycled. The short-term choices facing Obama are all awful; none of them are likely to resolve the underlying deep-seated problems or restore order to a region whose collective future looks increasingly bleak. There is, however, one thing that the US and its allies can do, and that is to set about creating an effective and expanded international community that actually lives up to the title. This will, of course, not be easy. The UN’s problems are legion and well known, yet it remains the starting point for any serious attempt to actually address the growing list of collective action problems that confront humanity. It is worth the effort. True, the US will be constrained, but it will also be relieved of the manifold costs of actions that will never be universally supported. It is neither politically feasible nor normatively desirable that a single country bears this sort of this burden. Finding ways to act collectively and inclusively is the challenge for the post-hegemonic 21st century. The survival of an international civilisation worthy of the name may depend on it.

                                It's no longer in doubt: Facebook is the world's largest open source company. Facebook could already have been considered to be in the open source lead through the release of its datacenter designs, databases and more. This week's open-sourcing of a network switch (Wedge) and its operating system (FBOSS) have cemented Facebook's place atop the podium of open source contributors. But have they also sounded the death knell for open source companies? After all, with so much incredible open source code emerging from Facebook, Google (which released PDFium this week), LinkedIn and others, is there still room for companies to sell open-source software? Inside The New Software Factory It has always been true that most software is developed for use, not sale, as author and open source advocate Eric Raymond famously pointed out in his  2001 book The Cathedral And The Bazaar. Yet most of our attention has been on software vendors as we place bets on Oracle or IBM, SAP or Microsoft et al. These are billion-dollar software companies, but the overall value of software being developed by open-source communities and behind the enterprise firewall is in the trillions of dollars, Red Hat's Michael Tiemann highlighted in 2009.  While nearly all software has been constrained by myopic, proprietary licensing, that's starting to change. Facebook and other Web giants recognize great value in releasing their code. The best developers want to work on the best code and increasingly the best code is open source. So Netflix, ostensibly a streaming video company, regularly hosts open source engineering days at its headquarters and makes a point of releasing its software in order to attract developers. That being said, Netflix did announce this week that it will be retiring its public application programming interface last week. All of which is great: more open source, more awesome. But for all the open-source software being developed and released by such companies, precious little is being supported in a way that makes it easy for mainstream enterprises to embrace. Spit, Polish And Commitment A good case in point is the Apache Cassandra project, which Facebook built and open sourced in 2008 to support its messaging system. Two years later, Facebook had moved on. As the company iterated on its messaging system, Facebook switched from Cassandra to Hbase: In 2008 we open-sourced Cassandra, an eventual-consistency key-value store that was already in production serving traffic for Inbox Search. Our Operations and Databases teams have extensive knowledge in managing and running MySQL, so switching off of either technology was a serious concern. We either had to move away from our investment in Cassandra or train our Operations teams to support a new, large system. We spent a few weeks setting up a test framework to evaluate clusters of MySQL, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, and a couple of other systems. We ultimately chose HBase. MySQL proved to not handle the long tail of data well; as indexes and data sets grew large, performance suffered. We found Cassandra's eventual consistency model to be a difficult pattern to reconcile for our new Messages infrastructure. Facebook, in other words, doesn't necessarily stick with a technology just because Facebook created it. As former Facebook engineer Steven Grimm notes, "Facebook is very pragmatic about which tools we use; the fact that Cassandra was originally developed in-house doesn't give it a significant leg up when we're deciding how to store the data for some new site feature, except in that the fact that we already have in-house expertise would factor into decisions about maintainability and so forth." Which is great for Facebook, but not necessarily for the many companies that have since embraced Cassandra like Netflix and Cisco. Especially for mainstream enterprises, they want an element of stability that Facebook simply can't deliver, because Facebook isn't in the business of supporting the software it open sources. A Continued Need For Open Source Companies Which is why we're just at the beginning of the "open source company" era, not the end. For every significant open-source project released by Facebook or its peers, there will be companies set up to provide ongoing maintenance and support for the code.  While it has become trite to declare that "every company must be a software company," the reality is most companies are a long way off from this goal. Even for companies with core competency in developing software, they don't necessarily have bandwidth to take on the maintenance of every open-source project that they use. As such, there will always be a need for open source companies who specialize in supporting software, not simply writing it. Cassandra offers a great example, with DataStax providing commercial support and ongoing development of the code, now residing with the Apache Software Foundation. But there are many other examples, like Hadoop, launched at Yahoo! and now supported by Hortonworks and Cloudera (among others), or Lucene, initially developed by Doug Cutting at Yahoo! but now supported by Elasticsearch, Lucidworks and others. We're entering the golden age of open source. All the most interesting, biggest trends in computing are being driven by open source, whether it's a mobile operating system running most of the world's smartphones, the cloud infrastructure supporting enterprise applications or the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> infrastructure that undergirds our ravenous desire for more data, better understood. And while much of this open-source software will be released by companies that aren't in the software business, per se, the best of it will be supported by those that are.

                                ReadWriteDrive is an ongoing series covering the future of transportation. When I first heard that Mercedes is integrating wearable technology—such as Pebble smartwatches and Google Glass—with its smart-vehicle systems, I thought the luxury automaker had a taken just a sip or two of Silicon Valley Kool-Aid. So I tried it out. Turns out, a week of driving a 2014 Mercedes CLA with Pebble tied to the car’s digital nervous system didn’t dispel my doubts about either the wisdom or usefulness of what I came to think of as wearing-while-driving. But I do have to give Mercedes credit for a gallant inaugural try at making the concept work. Driving While Wearing My smart-meets-smart experience started with plugging an iPhone into the car’s Lightning connector, which is tucked away in the glove box. It’s a good move that forces drivers to stow the phone away from temptation. The center dash’s 7-inch screen then turns into the interface for the Mercedes Digital DriveStyle app, which is still running on the iPhone. Think of DriveStyle as the main infotainment and navigation platform, delivered from the iPhone to the center console. (DriveStyle is only available for iOS at the moment.) You can then pair the Pebble to the phone via Bluetooth, after which it acts as a peripheral controller. It's quite the daisy chain of devices, and yet it's still not sufficient to complete the setup—the driver also needs to use the analog rotary dial controller between the front seats. I spun the dial to the “Media” category and then “Aux,” where I finished adding the Pebble to the chain. It takes a minute to wrap your mind around how everything is connected, but once you do, the setup isn't particularly complicated. When everything works and vehicle's engine is running, a little icon of a car appears on the top left corner of the watch. Bear in mind that my loaner Mercedes CLA 250 already has its own native dashboard infotainment and navigation functions, controlled by analog buttons and viewed on the center dash’s 7-inch screen. DriveStyle and Pebble supplant those old-school buttons. The digital high road aims to trump the analog world and its puny apps. Eyes on the Road What could not be overlooked is that I was driving a $43,245 Mercedes luxury automobile. Even without a lot of high-tech gear, the sporty CLA 250—with its 208-horsepower four-cylinder turbocharged engine, and paddle-controllable 7-speed transmission—would have provided sufficient cognitive engagement.  All I really needed was an open stretch of pavement and an easy way to crank up the volume on satellite radio. DriveStyle and the Pebble, however, offer an added layer of digital clutter. DriveStyle itself is a particularly flagrant offender. Start it up and the first thing you see are three vaguely named navigation categories—Social, Media and Places—each containing a bewildering set of apps. The Pebble aims to cut through some of that. Its primary function while driving is to get you to particular DriveStyle apps with a minimum of fuss. With my eyes mostly on the road, I could reach to the set of three buttons on the right side of the watch, and jump the dashboard screen into one of three pre-designated apps. (You can set these yourself, though not while you're driving.) A single push on the watch, for example, can start Google's traffic map, Apple's Siri, or Glympse, an app that lets you share your location with family or friends. Mercedes’s Pebble smartwatch effort—unveiled in January at 2014 CES, and made available a few weeks later—is ironically an attempt to re-focus drivers on driving by paring connectivity back to essential functions. Digital Shortcuts I came to think of the three buttons on the watch as an elaborate workaround to find things in DriveStyle, which itself supplanted the simpler use of analog buttons on the dash. Once you start daisy-chaining, I guess, it's hard to stop. While parked in my driveway, I had taken a look at DriveStyle’s social functionality—like access to bite-sized Facebook posts, Tweets or a social playlist of videos posted by friends. Those social tasks didn’t make sense to me. When I hit the road, I have zero desire to hear a robotic voice reading Ellen Degeneres’s latest tweets, one of the preset favorites on the loaner car. Things might be different if DriveStyle could read my texts or emails to me—but it can't, because iOS won't give it access to them. That left me looking for watch-based enhancements to the actual driving experience. I found the first example when I clicked my Pebble watch to bring up the Glympse app. The watch's only contribution to the proceedings was providing a shortcut to start the app. From there, I used the analog rotary dial on the center console to find my wife’s email address in the phone’s contacts, and set a time limit of 30 minutes. A moment later, my wife (back home) clicked on a link to open a page where she could track my progress on a map—eliminating any question about when I would be home. That was kind of handy, helping to avoid those inevitable texts: "R u close?" and "Be there in 5." As I drove, I found another item called “Places, Powered by Google” helpful, at least up to a point. That enabled searching for points of interest in a way that offers some improvement over the convoluted process most car-navigation systems force upon their users—usually by forcing them through a series of clumsy menus. The Places function, by contrast, at least allows you to search on words like "coffee," even if you do have to use the rotary dial to pick letters off the screen one at a time. The plus side here is that the DriveStyle app offers autocomplete results on the 7-inch screen, trumping the vehicle's native navigation system, and was available even on the move. (There’s no voice-recognition in the DriveStyle app for text entry.) A list of nearby cafes came up, providing distance from my location. Selecting one of the results allowed me to see open hours, star ratings, and a Google street view (controllable by the rotary dial). The way the street view images displayed, moving across as the dial spins, was slick. Mercedes realizes that smartphone innovation far outpaces the auto industry’s lumbering development cycle. By the time an automotive OEM can update its hardware, interface and apps, the electronics industry is at least a generation or two ahead. For example, the demo car natively connected to the Internet via 3G, while the tethered phone in the glove box was streaming by 4G LTE. The DriveStyle platform can add new apps as developers roll them out. Eventually, developers’ kits will allow third-party innovators to add driving apps. Good Vibrations A day or two of strapping on a Pebble watch only to use it for three shortcut buttons on my wrist left me wondering why Mercedes bothered. So I continued to toss the CLA around city streets and the winding roads of the Berkeley hills near where I live. And then the Pebble buzzed and flashed a screen reading, “Slow Down.” Turns out the DriveStyle’s Garmin integration, combined with GPS, had loaded up my location and local speed limits. When I exceeded the speed limit by about 10 percent, the watch vibrated and issued its warning. It’s standard Pebble functionality to push notifications when you get a text message, a phone call, or an email. Based on the type of vibration, you know what’s up without taking the phone out of your pocket. Mercedes took the idea of push notifications and repurposed it for driving safety. Different warnings for, say, a reported accident or road construction, each have their signature type of vibration, so you don’t have to take your eyes off the road to know lies ahead. I didn’t encounter an accident or road hazard during my week, so “Slow Down” was the only vibration I experienced. It was effective, and the only interaction with the watch that didn’t duplicate what the car would have provided without the wearable. Something about feeling the buzz—sort of a literal slap on the wrist—grabbed my attention. I slowed down. Another button on the Pebble would have let me push road condition notifications in the other direction—for instance, had I seen an accident that I wanted to report. Like the other functions started by the watch, completing the process would have required using the rotary dial, causing more distraction, and increasing chances that I would become the next accident. Yet Mercedes told me that on some models, if the driver pulls off the road, lifts the hood and puts on the emergency flashers, the car will automatically report the problem to other Mercedes app users. The company is looking to integrate this functionality with Waze and similar services not limited to Mercedes cars. Car Apps Outside the Car When you reach your destination and power down the car, the mode-icon on the top left of the phone switches from a car to a walking person. As you step away from the car, the watch receives a full download of your car’s precise location, the trip distance, the amount of fuel left in the tank, and—apparently for use in case your car is stolen—the car’s model name and VIN number. On some models, though not my loaner CLA, you also get a reading of air pressure for all four tires. I liked these functions, but saw them more as a curiosity than essential <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span>. In addition to Mercedes’s Pebble integration, I also got a five-minute run-through of how Google Glass could become part of the driving experience. The same diagnostics delivered to the watch after a drive—as well as walking directions from where you parked to where you need to go—can be deployed to Glass. This was my very first experience with Google Glass, so most of my time was spent simply fitting the device to my face and making the screen visible.  The simplicity of the watch made more sense for getting a quick read on fuel and tire pressure. Google Glass is also put to use prior to getting into the car. As you stroll to your car, speak your desired point of interest to Glass. The eyeglass screen then provides walking turn-by-turn directions first to your car, and then driving turn-by-turn instructions to the dashboard navigation. Theoretically, there's no downtime, and the act of driving and living become a single blurred experience.   That idea, and more generally the use of wearables behind the wheel, has some merit.  I’m sure that Mercedes and other automakers will continue to experiment. But I have to admit that after a week, I was relieved to return the CLA and Pebble—and get back to my own dumb car, with its simple singular interface designed simply for driving.

                                Solar City’s acquisition of a solar-panel startup could help it lower installation costs and produce inexpensive solar power, but it’ll need more production capacity. Billionaire, Tesla founder, and private space entrepreneur <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> announced yesterday that Solar City, the solar installation company where he is chairman, plans to acquire a startup called Silevo for $200 million (plus up to $150 million more if the company meets certain goals). And with typical bravado, he also said that the company plans to build a huge factory to produce Silevo’s high-efficiency solar panels, a strategy he claims will make solar power “way cheaper” than power from fossil fuels.

NASA may use a quadcopter to explore the surface of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, according to a new interview at Science Recorder with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory senior researcher Larry Matthies. Titan is widely speculated to have chemical processes that are "prebiotic," which are similar to those that existed on a pre-life planet Earth. Scientists also believe that its icy shell masks a massive ocean of liquid water which could, in theory, be the nearest possible reservoir of life off our own planet.

He's not content with a single exploration trip, though. "I'm hopeful that the first people could be taken to Mars in 10 to 12 years. I think it's certainly possible for that to occur," he told CNBC. "But the thing that matters long term is to have a self-sustaining city on Mars, to make life multi-planetary."

The case in question involves <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> woman Carla Gericke, who was arrested and charged with wiretapping in 2010. Gericke was caught recording her friend being questioned by the Weare Police Department during a late-night traffic stop. Woman Never Ordered to Stop Recording Traffic Stop Gericke was actually in a car behind her friend and announced to ... (view more)

                                THE author of “Fifty Shades of Grey”, E.L. James, has mused at length about a billionaire inflicting punishment in her bondage-based bestseller. As the recipient of one of the first right-hand-drive versions of the Tesla Model S to hit Britain’s roads, personally handed to her at an event in London last week by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>, the carmaker’s wealthy boss, she is clearly attuned to billionaires dishing out pleasure too. The “range anxiety” that afflicts other electric-car owners has been minimised in the Model S by packing it with lots of batteries; the agony-inducing cost of filling up at the petrol station need never bother Ms James again.Other all-electric cars, costly and with limited ranges, have proved a hard sell. The models from most mainstream carmakers still look and feel like gimmicks. Tesla’s main achievement is producing a car which can be judged credibly alongside any fast and expensive petrol-propelled saloon. But the Californian company’s long-term growth prospects, and the widespread adoption of electric cars, are both dependent on a big drop in battery costs. Tesla’s next mission, to begin making a cheaper, mass-market electric vehicle...

                                MEDIOBANCA was founded in 1946 with an explicit mission to rebuild Italian industry in the aftermath of the second world war. The result was a web of cross-shareholdings and pacts among big shareholders, with the Milanese investment bank at its centre, which allowed a narrow elite to control many of the country’s biggest businesses for decades. So the announcement last year that Mediobanca would exit these pacts and focus on its core business constituted a dramatic reversal. What with a similar move by Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer, the web is beginning to look a little tattered (see chart).Mediobanca has sold €800m ($1.1 billion) of equities over the past nine months, half of its three-year goal. Both it and Generali say they will exit the pact that controls Telecom Italia this month, and eventually sell their shares. Privatisation is also changing things. The government is selling part of Fincantieri, one of Europe’s biggest shipbuilders, this month; Poste Italiane, the postal service, will probably be next. Many privately held firms plan offerings too, led by Cerved, a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>-services company.

                                EXUBERANCE about both “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” and Twitter has of late given way to a degree of scepticism among commentators. Yet Dataminr, a New York startup that analyses the 500m or so tweets sent out daily, goes from strength to strength. Founded in 2009 to scour the Twittersphere for important events and news not yet reported by the mainstream media, the firm now has dozens of customers in finance, the news business and the public sector. In January it and Twitter struck a deal to provide alerts to CNN. In April its tracking of tweets was part of a strategy by the authorities in Boston to avoid a repeat of last year’s terrorist attack at the city’s annual marathon.Dataminr scores every tweet using about 30 indicators of significance, says Ted Bailey, who launched the firm with two former Yale roommates. Dataminr started out seeking market-sensitive information for investors. It now supplies around 50 financial firms. Then came various arms of government; Mr Bailey claims ten clients, though he will name only the city of Boston.Sorting out the signal from the Twitter noise is not easy. How to tell which tweeters are on to something, and which are just twits? Is there a clue in their language, or their location? Can a false positive be spotted fast enough?Much of Dataminr’s early work involved tracing back stories that proved genuine, and market-moving events, to find their earliest...
