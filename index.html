In a new report from BI Intelligence, we size the commercial and military <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> market to estimate how big the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry could become, and which industries are most likely to see <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s become part of their business model in the next few years.

And we assess how <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> development will proceed in light of stiff safety and privacy concerns and regulatory hurdles.  Access The Full Report By Signing Up For A Free Trial Today » Here are some of the issues and opportunities that will impact how the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry develops:  American regulators plan to phase in commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> flights beginning in 2015, starting with limited flights of small <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s weighing 55 pounds or less. Retail and e-commerce — along with the related logistics and shipping industries — arguably have the most at stake in the wide deployment of civilian and commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> might be the missing link in the shipping chain that allows for nearly immediate e-commerce deliveries. But there are few industries that couldn't potentially be touched by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, especially on the enterprise side. Currently, military applications dominate the global UAV market, but commercial applications will quickly ramp up over the next 10 years, particularly after 2020.  Privacy and safety concerns still pose the risk of chilling commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> flights in many markets, but if UAVs are rolled out gradually, we believe the benefits of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>-powered commercial applications, such as environmental monitoring and shipping, will ultimately win public opinion over.

                                When most people think open source they think of software Github projects and hackers determined to code for the Greater Good. But its also a wholesale philosophy that can be applied to many aspects of society—like running a city. The basic principle behind open source code—that its available to anyone to use, modify, and build off of—translates to politics in the form of transparent governments, open, readily available data, and encouraging citizens to engage in the political process. Think of a city like a Wikipedia page, where residents are free to suggest edits and changes. This method of governance may sound alien today, but open government is an old idea, dating back to the Enlightenment, when attitudes shifted toward transparency and handing citizens more influence in politics. Open source governance is sort of an modern-day version of these perennial ideals, updated with smartphones and the internet in mind. In the early 2000s, an open source governance movement budded in Canada, and hitched up to the local Green Party. The campaign since morphed into OpenPolitics.ca—a group which champions mass intelligence and proudly casts aside politics as usual. The leaderless Occupy Wall Street had many of these principles in mind and was often branded an open source movement. A handful of scattered governments, like Helsinki, Melbourne, and Vancouver, use openly editable wiki tools to promote civic engagement. Now open source governance is burgeoning in the US, in Raleigh, North Carolina, home to the open source software company Red Hat. The idea is that in the information age citizens shouldn't have to drag over a Town Hall barn and listen to hours on the local water sprinkler schedule in order to participate and generate a positive influence in the community. Residents of Raleigh can lazily sip on coffee while typing in input to the city's forums, and report potholes in real-time with their smart phone. The city-wide initiative is called Open Raleigh, and its great news for transparency. Raleighs city government hosts an aggressive open data project, publishing pages of government data on everything from police and fire incidents to finance. Raleigh lawmakers understand that sifting through pages of data isn't something any reasonable person, however engaged, would do, so it present colorful visual data for citizens to draw on and act on. The city strives to become a worldwide model for the open source city. The thinking is that a transparent government is going to more it accountable, and this way citizens and journalists wont have to file slow-going Freedom of Information requests in order to learn what the government is up to. Not all city records are public, but Raleigh is considerably more transparent than your average municipal government—citizens even helped determine which information ultimately landed on the town website. The Open Raleigh experiment kickstarted in 2012 with the Open Resolution, a roadmap it calls a living document—open and revisable, naturally. It was spearheaded in part by former resident and project manager at Red Hat, Jason Hibbets. He wrote a book about the experiment, The Foundations for an Open Source City, and actively collaborated with the government to implement many of the citys user-friendly open source tools. The layers of open source are thick: community-led unconferences, open source startups, a LocalWiki. The Raleigh city government also implemented SeeClickFix, a bug reporting app for civil infrastructure. Using geo-based message broadcasting, citizens can report potholes, overflowing trashcans, and other nuisances. In other words, its a much more user-friendly way to perform your civic duty than the traditional reporting mechanism in most cities: trying to figure out who to call in the first place, then being bounced from department to department until you (maybe) reach the right place. Citizens of Raleigh also collaborated to develop CityShape, an ambitious project that would utilize open data to calculate a community health score. The project pulls open data from SeeClickFlix, geographic information system data, and community data to generate heat maps and other visuals for a clearer representation of the city's health. Citizens and city could use this to determine where to locate and build community centers, sidewalks, or bike lanes. Raleighs not alone; again, the open source governance movement is loose, in one form or another. Many ambitious open source advocates hope to use open source tools to strike the root of governance, rather than build off of existing systems. Law professor and activist Lawrence Lessig once floated the idea of assigning the open values of the internet to governance generally. Dark Wallet developer Amir Taaki sees an opportunity for re-evaluation in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>—an open source tool itself. Taaki described to Motherboard how open source anonymity crypto-tools are laying the groundwork for open source cities and shanty towns powered by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s hidden abilities to facilitate cleaner voting and easy-to-use contracts. Raleigh is less abstract. As the guinea pig, its hoping to shape a working model that other towns and cities could easily adopt. The ideas are there; the widgets are there. Hibbets suggests that citizens pester their lawmakers to adopt the open tools being tested in Raleigh. After all, this is the open source philosophy at its heart: open governance wont work unless citizens are active.

                                To most people, the idea of cryptographic currency is essentially synonymous with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. But <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is just one of hundreds of competing mathematical currencies available through online exchanges. As this spread of community-focused and oftentimes esoteric <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> continues exploding, what's it take to survive? Some cryptocurrencies are marketed to particular groups. Theres HamRadioCoin for amateur broadcasters, TacoCoin for taco lovers everywhere, and JuggaloCoin for fans of none other than the Insane Clown Posse. There are digital coins modeled after rival currencies from Star Treks United Federation of Planets and Klingon empire. Theres even a currency called BumbaCoin thats automatically distributed to Internet trolls who post Jamaican vulgarities in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> forums. But even <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> creators say successfully launching a new alternative currency, or "altcoin," is far from trivial and requires careful attention to state-of-the-art math and computer science, economics, and old-fashioned marketing and community building. With so much competition, coins that dont quickly grab and hold on to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> markets attention and earn users trust can easily drop in value and find themselves vanishing from online exchanges. Almost all the altcoins these days have been created with little or no consideration for the three aspects described above, Larry Ren, the lead developer on ReddCoin, which aims to make it easier to send money through existing social networking sites, told me. There is little surprise that the average shelf life of an altcoin is a couple of months or even weeks. To tap into an existing community base, some other coins are tied to specific real-world geographical locations. Theres a NewYorkCoin, a VegasCoin (naturally), and an ItalyCoin. Irish <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> fans can choose between EireCoin, Gaelcoin, and IrishCoin, which of course has already been used to buy a pint of Guinness in a Dublin pub. Boosters of the geographical currencies say they can be used in giveaways to spur tourists to spend more money and can help keeps funds in local economies, similar to paper community currencies already in use in some towns and cities. The same impulse seems to motivate members of other types of communities, like the creators of JuggaloCoin. The most important thing to understand about Juggalo culture is that it is all about Family and helping each other out, says the JuggaloCoin site. By spending Juggalo Coins, Juggalos can be certain that their money is going to someone who is down with the clown. JuggaloCoin logo. Image: JuggaloCoin And VegasCoin creator Brandon Yates told me he thinks <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> is a natural fit for Sin City, where visitors are already used to exchanging money for casino chips and cashing in drink vouchers at bars and clubs. In an email, he argued some visitors might be happy with the added anonymity of a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=virtual currency">virtual currency</a></span>, which theyll be able to spend at bars, strip clubs and, perhaps one day, casinos through a smartphone wallet app. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas—unless its on your credit card statement, he wrote. Las Vegas is a sunny place for shady people and there are all sorts of transactions that visitors to the city of sin dont want seen by snooping spouses, corporate accountants, or the NSA. Other coins are aimed at other types of markets where traditional payment systems arent available, or buyers and sellers want extra anonymity. For instance, firearms enthusiasts, tired of being blacklisted by PayPal and other payment providers, can transact business in Guncoin. Guncoins anonymous project manager told me in an email that many involved with firearms were distrustful of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, and are more likely to accept a coin created by and for gun enthusiasts. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas—unless its on your credit card statement. Most people we have talked to really have no idea what <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> or <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> even is, and few are interested in learning more, Guncoin's manager wrote. The industry really needed a firearms-specific crypto to get their attention.  Similarly, cannabis traders, who also experience problems dealing with the banking system, can choose between HempCoin, PotCoin, Cannacoin, and CannabisCoin. Porn purveyors can offer customers a credit card alternative with GroinCoin, TitCoin, or WankCoin. Really. People who want to buy adult material or tip cam models are often reluctant in doing so for fear of being caught by their significant others when credit card statements roll in, as Greg, a Canadian accountant involved in WankCoins creation, told me over email. And credit card fees are high in the adult industry because of the risk of chargebacks, making merchants willing to seek alternatives, he added. In a WankCoin promotional video modeled after a newscast, a trio of woman scientists—clad only in open lab coats, bras, and panties—force a male captive to masturbate, faster and faster, using his wank energy to power their computers and generate more currency. When he reaches 1.21 jigafaps of pumping power, their 1950s-style computer console ejaculates physical coins like a slot machine, causing one of the buxom scientists to jump up and down with glee. In reality, the mining process by which new WankCoins are created is more prosaic. As with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, WankCoin transactions are published to the network of active users, and coin miners work to place them on the shared public ledger called the blockchain. Each block on that chain is a set of new transaction records, along with various other housekeeping data. When miners add a new block to the chain, theyre automatically rewarded with newly-generated coins, plus transaction fees associated with the transactions logged in the block. "We need more power! You heard her: Keep on pumping!" Not every set of transaction records is a valid block, however—information from a block is run through a cryptographic hashing function, a kind of algorithm that transforms arbitrary strings of data into a fixed-size number. Cryptographic hash functions are designed to make it difficult to predict the functions output or to find a string of data that hashes to a particular value other than by trial and error. Only blocks that hash to a number smaller than a certain threshold are considered valid. This means miners have to try different combinations of transactions and other data until they find an acceptable block. Most coins aim to have new blocks added at a constant rate, and the underlying software will automatically adjust the difficulty of mining by raising and lowering the hash threshold as new blocks are created faster or slower than the target rate. When <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> first launched, it was possible to mine coins with a regular computers CPU. But as the currency grew in popularity and value, miners moved first from the CPU to graphics cards, which were better suited to the rapid-fire arithmetic needed to quickly compute possible hash values, and then to machines with specialized mining chips called ASICs, for application-specific integrated circuits.

And with scrypt-focused ASICs now on the market, other currencies have switched to still more esoteric hashing algorithms, including one formula called X11 that combines the output of 11 different functions into one hash. One currency, called <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=PrimeCoin">PrimeCoin</a></span>, requires that hashes be linked to certain chains of prime numbers of interest to mathematicians, so miners are potentially doing scientifically useful work as they record transactions and generate new coins. Creators of new cryptocurrencies must choose all of the mathematical settings for their coins: the target mining rate, the hashing algorithm, the number of coins given per block to successful miners, and the total number of coins to be created, among others. VegasCoin, for instance, tops out at 100 million total coins, compared to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s 21 million and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Litecoin">Litecoin</a></span>s 84 million. Generating too many coins can mean the currencys not worth enough to motivate miners and investors; generate too few, and the currency can be worth too much and impractical to spend.

Our 30 coin block reward was arrived at by the toss of the dice, gotta love that Vegas style! A key factor in our decision to use SHA-256 algorithm was because the majority of crypto enthusiasts have invested a lot of money in equipment that only mines using this algorithm, wrote Greg, of WankCoin.

Getting coins listed on exchanges, where users can buy them using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> or traditional currency, has gotten harder as the number of coins has exploded, said Tim Renzetti, the creator of HempCoin. "The folks who were in it in the beginning got on the exchanges pretty easy, he told me. "We were a month or two months after PotCoin, so getting on the exchanges was not a big goal for us, but it should have been. Some older currencies were also premined, Renzetti explained, meaning the currencies launched with a set of coins already in the creators control. Premining helped some coins get off the ground by letting creators give them away to target users, or sell them IPO-style to raise money to promote the coins. But investors and miners are now wary of the practice after a series of pump-and-dump style scams where creators dumped their premined coins, then essentially abandoned their currencies. "For anyone coming in the game right now, it would be very, very difficult, said Renzetti, who added that he still thinks different geographical regions and different industries will ultimately settle on different <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span>. "You would have to have money to do it, because the idea of having a premined coin is not gonna happen any more. The community won't allow it." For anyone coming in the game right now, it would be very, very difficult. Alongside the announcements of new coins on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Talk are warnings about poorly planned coins and outright scams, sometimes called shitcoins. In some cases, users have even spotted hidden premines embedded in the source code powering various coins, usually letting the creator of the first blocks in a coins chain claim arbitrarily large rewards, letting coinmakers secretly sell large quantities of the coin as soon as exchanges open. Let me describe the scenario, one <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Talk user wrote in warning of a possible scam. Dev releases some shitty [anonymity] system, gets all the IPO money. Dumps all the hidden premine and vanishes into the crypto-fog. With premining out of fashion, coin creators should expect to spend about 10 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> of their own funds supporting a launch, one of the anonymous creators of GroinCoin wrote me in an email. That includes developer time for the coin software and website, ads and marketing, and coins for targeted giveaways and faucets—websites and automated programs that distribute coins either for free or in exchange for promoting the coin online. It is not cheap, and it can rarely be done by one person, wrote the GroinCoin creator. For its part, GroinCoin had a successful launch, despite more initial mining attention than its creators anticipated, according to the email. Bursts of mining have become a common issue for new currencies, after the creation of multipools—groups of miners who move in tandem from currency to currency, targeting the greatest monetary reward for the least computing power and pooling their collective earnings. Newer coins with small dedicated bases have adopted new, more complicated algorithms to set mining complexity, since simpler approaches like taking a rolling average over time dont react well to a sudden influx or departure of multipool miners. People with large hashing power tend to jump between currencies, and without per difficulty block adjustments, the people left mining often face difficulties in the form of extended block finding times, wrote WankCoins Greg, explaining that WankCoin uses an algorithm called DigiShield to stabilize difficulty rates. This is Reddcoin. But even with countermeasures in place, multipools generally push down the price of new coins, since a rising price will be counteracted by multipool mining and selling, said ReddCoin's Ren. Given the huge amount of hash power at the disposal of multipools, any price increase attracts more hash power which leads to more sell pressure which in turn causes the price to decrease, he wrote in an email. An equilibrium is achieved when the price stabilizes at the cost of mining plus a thin profit margin (for miners). It's simple economics. ReddCoin itself is in the midst of switching its mining algorithm to a new formula called proof-of-stake velocity that seeks to give coins to active, dedicated fans of the currency, not just users with the most powerful computers. PoSV minting, the counterpart to [traditional proof of work] mining, requires little computing power or energy and can be done on CPUs of PCs, laptops and even mobile devices, according to ReddCoins description of the new algorithm. Every Reddcoin user will automatically become a PoSV minter. Even so, Ren said many currency creators dont do enough to differentiate themselves technologically and economically, and effectively disappear after just a few weeks of trading. The value of the currency only increases if the developers and community are dedicated to building the ecosystem over a long period time, he wrote.

                                To most people, the idea of cryptographic currency is essentially synonymous with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. But <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is just one of hundreds of competing mathematical currencies available through online exchanges. As this spread of community-focused and oftentimes esoteric <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> continues exploding, what's it take to survive? Some cryptocurrencies are marketed to particular groups. Theres HamRadioCoin for amateur broadcasters, TacoCoin for taco lovers everywhere, and JuggaloCoin for fans of none other than the Insane Clown Posse. There are digital coins modeled after rival currencies from Star Treks United Federation of Planets and Klingon empire. Theres even a currency called BumbaCoin thats automatically distributed to Internet trolls who post Jamaican vulgarities in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> forums. But even <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> creators say successfully launching a new alternative currency, or "altcoin," is far from trivial and requires careful attention to state-of-the-art math and computer science, economics, and old-fashioned marketing and community building. With so much competition, coins that dont quickly grab and hold on to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> markets attention and earn users trust can easily drop in value and find themselves vanishing from online exchanges. Almost all the altcoins these days have been created with little or no consideration for the three aspects described above, Larry Ren, the lead developer on ReddCoin, which aims to make it easier to send money through existing social networking sites, told me. There is little surprise that the average shelf life of an altcoin is a couple of months or even weeks. To tap into an existing community base, some other coins are tied to specific real-world geographical locations. Theres a NewYorkCoin, a VegasCoin (naturally), and an ItalyCoin. Irish <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> fans can choose between EireCoin, Gaelcoin, and IrishCoin, which of course has already been used to buy a pint of Guinness in a Dublin pub. Boosters of the geographical currencies say they can be used in giveaways to spur tourists to spend more money and can help keeps funds in local economies, similar to paper community currencies already in use in some towns and cities. The same impulse seems to motivate members of other types of communities, like the creators of JuggaloCoin. The most important thing to understand about Juggalo culture is that it is all about Family and helping each other out, says the JuggaloCoin site. By spending Juggalo Coins, Juggalos can be certain that their money is going to someone who is down with the clown. JuggaloCoin logo. Image: JuggaloCoin And VegasCoin creator Brandon Yates told me he thinks <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> is a natural fit for Sin City, where visitors are already used to exchanging money for casino chips and cashing in drink vouchers at bars and clubs. In an email, he argued some visitors might be happy with the added anonymity of a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=virtual currency">virtual currency</a></span>, which theyll be able to spend at bars, strip clubs and, perhaps one day, casinos through a smartphone wallet app. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas—unless its on your credit card statement, he wrote. Las Vegas is a sunny place for shady people and there are all sorts of transactions that visitors to the city of sin dont want seen by snooping spouses, corporate accountants, or the NSA. Other coins are aimed at other types of markets where traditional payment systems arent available, or buyers and sellers want extra anonymity. For instance, firearms enthusiasts, tired of being blacklisted by PayPal and other payment providers, can transact business in Guncoin. Guncoins anonymous project manager told me in an email that many involved with firearms were distrustful of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, and are more likely to accept a coin created by and for gun enthusiasts. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas—unless its on your credit card statement. Most people we have talked to really have no idea what <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> or <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> even is, and few are interested in learning more, Guncoin's manager wrote. The industry really needed a firearms-specific crypto to get their attention.  Similarly, cannabis traders, who also experience problems dealing with the banking system, can choose between HempCoin, PotCoin, Cannacoin, and CannabisCoin. Porn purveyors can offer customers a credit card alternative with GroinCoin, TitCoin, or WankCoin. Really. People who want to buy adult material or tip cam models are often reluctant in doing so for fear of being caught by their significant others when credit card statements roll in, as Greg, a Canadian accountant involved in WankCoins creation, told me over email. And credit card fees are high in the adult industry because of the risk of chargebacks, making merchants willing to seek alternatives, he added. In a WankCoin promotional video modeled after a newscast, a trio of woman scientists—clad only in open lab coats, bras, and panties—force a male captive to masturbate, faster and faster, using his wank energy to power their computers and generate more currency. When he reaches 1.21 jigafaps of pumping power, their 1950s-style computer console ejaculates physical coins like a slot machine, causing one of the buxom scientists to jump up and down with glee. In reality, the mining process by which new WankCoins are created is more prosaic. As with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, WankCoin transactions are published to the network of active users, and coin miners work to place them on the shared public ledger called the blockchain. Each block on that chain is a set of new transaction records, along with various other housekeeping data. When miners add a new block to the chain, theyre automatically rewarded with newly-generated coins, plus transaction fees associated with the transactions logged in the block. "We need more power! You heard her: Keep on pumping!" Not every set of transaction records is a valid block, however—information from a block is run through a cryptographic hashing function, a kind of algorithm that transforms arbitrary strings of data into a fixed-size number. Cryptographic hash functions are designed to make it difficult to predict the functions output or to find a string of data that hashes to a particular value other than by trial and error. Only blocks that hash to a number smaller than a certain threshold are considered valid. This means miners have to try different combinations of transactions and other data until they find an acceptable block. Most coins aim to have new blocks added at a constant rate, and the underlying software will automatically adjust the difficulty of mining by raising and lowering the hash threshold as new blocks are created faster or slower than the target rate. When <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> first launched, it was possible to mine coins with a regular computers CPU. But as the currency grew in popularity and value, miners moved first from the CPU to graphics cards, which were better suited to the rapid-fire arithmetic needed to quickly compute possible hash values, and then to machines with specialized mining chips called ASICs, for application-specific integrated circuits. Partly to make mining practical on ordinary computers again, some currencies deliberately use different hashing algorithms than <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, so machines built to mine <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> dont have the same advantages over ordinary household computers. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Litecoin">Litecoin</a></span>, often said to be second in popularity to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, uses a hashing algorithm called scrypt, as do its many variants, including the Shiba-Inu-meme-inspired <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></span>.

An equilibrium is achieved when the price stabilizes at the cost of mining plus a thin profit margin (for miners). It's simple economics. ReddCoin itself is in the midst of switching its mining algorithm to a new formula called proof-of-stake velocity that seeks to give coins to active, dedicated fans of the currency, not just users with the most powerful computers. PoSV minting, the counterpart to [traditional proof of work] mining, requires little computing power or energy and can be done on CPUs of PCs, laptops and even mobile devices, according to ReddCoins description of the new algorithm. Every Reddcoin user will automatically become a PoSV minter. Even so, Ren said many currency creators dont do enough to differentiate themselves technologically and economically, and effectively disappear after just a few weeks of trading. The value of the currency only increases if the developers and community are dedicated to building the ecosystem over a long period time, he wrote.

                                Thailand's military junta seized power by launching a coup, imposing martial law, and muzzling the media—all tactics the regime doesn't seem to have a problem with, unless they happen in a video game. According to an AP story, the National Council for Peace and Order, the military junta that seized power in Thailand in May, just banned Tropico 5, a computer game that lets users play dictator. The concept of Tropico 5, the fifth installment of a successful city-building simulation franchise, is quite simple. You, under the guise of a El Presidente, have to erect your Latin American-style city, and then run it through the ages, doing whatever it takes to cling on to power. Election-rigging, political assassination and merciless crushing of dissent are just some of the techniques that Tropicos caudillo can resort to in order to go to next level. That game seems to have touched a nerve among Thailands top brass. The reason for the ban, a spokesperson of video game distributor New Era Thailand told the AP, was that some part of its content might affect peace and order in the country.  The exact issue is unclear, but there are certainly parallels you could draw between the idea of the game and events in Thailand. The junta has detained activists without charge, imposed curfews, and restricted the media. Regardless the cause, the fact that a political entity has felt the need to ban a video game in the first place is interesting. Thailand's case is admittedly quite exceptional, but there's also a more general trend of video games being censored not only on the basis of the usual sex-violence dyad, but for political reasons.  China is unsurprisingly among the most active when it comes to vetoing video games that deal with issues it considers taboo. Ten years ago, Beijing blocked the sale of Football Manager 2005 because it recognised Taiwan and Tibet as separate countries, when China considered them part of its territory. Something similar—the depiction of Tibet and Taiwan as independent entities—triggered the ban of strategy game Hearts of Iron in 2005.  In 2013, Chinas Ministry of Culture went on a rampage against another war video game, Battlefield 4, ordering downloads to be deleted immediately. Battlefield 4s plot revolves around an uprising in China, something that authorities considered a threat to national security and a form of cultural invasion. Other nations have taken issue with how video games have presented their country in combat scenes; similar bans were adopted for various games in Pakistan last year, and Iran in 2011. There was a similar rationale behind the politically-motivated ban of a video game in South Korea in 2011. Homefront, a first-person shooter, envisioned the invasion of South Korea (and the US) by North Korea. As the relationship between the Koreas was particularly strained in 2011, the game was likely banned to avoid worsening diplomatic tensions. Like other forms of art, video games can act as interactive political cases for the views of their authors. Sometimes it happens in quite a blatant way. Over the last few weeks, as the conflict in Gaza intensified, many instant games inspired by the conflict popped up in Google Play and the Apple App Store and were swiftly removed by the companies. In almost all cases, they were poorly disguised soapboxes: In Bomb Gaza, the player had to kill terrorists in Palestine while avoiding civilian casualties; in Gaza Hero, you had to touch Israeli soldiers to transfigure them into food and medicines. The issues there are pretty clear-cut, but it's equally important to recognise that political angles in video games can also be used in a positive, much more nuanced way. Just think about Hideo Kojimas Metal Gear series and how it raises questions about the global military-industrial complex: With hindsight, Metal Gear Solid 4 looks like a powerful heads-up about some of the issues we are dealing with right now, from the privatization of armies to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> wars.  Unlike the Gaza-inspired shoot-the-bad-guy games that are mushrooming today, Metal Gear had a solid, nuanced narrative and treated the topic of war and technology in all its shades of grey. The white knight-black guard narrative was often turned upside down—and the solution was almost never attainable just by going berserk and shooting everybody.

                                Thailand's military junta seized power by launching a coup, imposing martial law, and muzzling the media—all tactics the regime doesn't seem to have a problem with, unless they happen in a video game. According to an AP story, the National Council for Peace and Order, the military junta that seized power in Thailand in May, just banned Tropico 5, a computer game that lets users play dictator. The concept of Tropico 5, the fifth installment of a successful city-building simulation franchise, is quite simple. You, under the guise of a El Presidente, have to erect your Latin American-style city, and then run it through the ages, doing whatever it takes to cling on to power. Election-rigging, political assassination and merciless crushing of dissent are just some of the techniques that Tropicos caudillo can resort to in order to go to next level. That game seems to have touched a nerve among Thailands top brass. The reason for the ban, a spokesperson of video game distributor New Era Thailand told the AP, was that some part of its content might affect peace and order in the country.  The exact issue is unclear, but there are certainly parallels you could draw between the idea of the game and events in Thailand. The junta has detained activists without charge, imposed curfews, and restricted the media. Regardless the cause, the fact that a political entity has felt the need to ban a video game in the first place is interesting. Thailand's case is admittedly quite exceptional, but there's also a more general trend of video games being censored not only on the basis of the usual sex-violence dyad, but for political reasons.  China is unsurprisingly among the most active when it comes to vetoing video games that deal with issues it considers taboo. Ten years ago, Beijing blocked the sale of Football Manager 2005 because it recognised Taiwan and Tibet as separate countries, when China considered them part of its territory. Something similar—the depiction of Tibet and Taiwan as independent entities—triggered the ban of strategy game Hearts of Iron in 2005.  In 2013, Chinas Ministry of Culture went on a rampage against another war video game, Battlefield 4, ordering downloads to be deleted immediately. Battlefield 4s plot revolves around an uprising in China, something that authorities considered a threat to national security and a form of cultural invasion. Other nations have taken issue with how video games have presented their country in combat scenes; similar bans were adopted for various games in Pakistan last year, and Iran in 2011. There was a similar rationale behind the politically-motivated ban of a video game in South Korea in 2011. Homefront, a first-person shooter, envisioned the invasion of South Korea (and the US) by North Korea. As the relationship between the Koreas was particularly strained in 2011, the game was likely banned to avoid worsening diplomatic tensions. Like other forms of art, video games can act as interactive political cases for the views of their authors. Sometimes it happens in quite a blatant way. Over the last few weeks, as the conflict in Gaza intensified, many instant games inspired by the conflict popped up in Google Play and the Apple App Store and were swiftly removed by the companies. In almost all cases, they were poorly disguised soapboxes: In Bomb Gaza, the player had to kill terrorists in Palestine while avoiding civilian casualties; in Gaza Hero, you had to touch Israeli soldiers to transfigure them into food and medicines. The issues there are pretty clear-cut, but it's equally important to recognise that political angles in video games can also be used in a positive, much more nuanced way. Just think about Hideo Kojimas Metal Gear series and how it raises questions about the global military-industrial complex: With hindsight, Metal Gear Solid 4 looks like a powerful heads-up about some of the issues we are dealing with right now, from the privatization of armies to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> wars.  Unlike the Gaza-inspired shoot-the-bad-guy games that are mushrooming today, Metal Gear had a solid, nuanced narrative and treated the topic of war and technology in all its shades of grey. The white knight-black guard narrative was often turned upside down—and the solution was almost never attainable just by going berserk and shooting everybody.

With defaults in recent history, and dwindling oil reserves it will be interesting to see how this decision turns out. From the article: "Congress last month approved legislation to start a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currency">digital currency</a></span> for use alongside the U.S. dollar, the official tender in Ecuador. Once signed into law, the country will begin using the as-yet-unnamed currency as soon as October. A monetary authority will be established to regulate the money, which will be backed by 'liquid assets.'” <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

Now, almost a full year after first denying they had a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>, the department has come clean and apologized for hiding the program, promising more transparency and to pursue federal approval for the program, which the police department had, internally, claimed immunity from previously. <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                If I've learned anything from watching The Wire, it's that, after committing a murder, you want to make sure your gun is good and submerged after you inevitably toss it in some body of water. I suppose the same goes for if you happen to go on a burglary spree. Unfortunately for one alleged criminal in New York, he didn't hide the his weapons well enough: Local police in Jefferson County, New York called on a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> company to scan a body of water where they suspected five stolen rifles had been stashed. The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> found them, no problem. Indeed, 22-year-old Tyler Farmer was arrested on several counts of grand larceny, burglary, criminal mischief, and possession of a controlled substance—he allegedly stole at least five rifles, jewelry, medicine, and, oddly enough, a canoe.  The Jefferson County Sheriff's office said that Horizon Aerial Media Services, a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> photography business in the area, helped them recover some of the items. "It's not that dramatic, but we got a call from the detectives—they said they thought a few of the firearms might be in the water, but they were having trouble searching it themselves," Jason Desjardins, the business owner, told me. "We searched, flew a couple feet above the water and when we looked at the video, you could the the reflections of something [that looked like a gun] beneath the surface. As vague as it sounded, it worked. That's where it was." Desjardins says the police department didn't pay him for his work, but with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s often being villainized by police, and commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> companies working in a legal grey area, he says that he's happy to help with anything that might change that perception. Lots of police departments are looking into <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, and some of them have already bought them. But, so far, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s have only been used to help make one arrest, back in 2011.

"He was already in custody, but they told me the evidence was key," Desjardins said.

As our new research published in Climatic Change shows, some activities aimed at tackling greenhouse emissions can also consume large amounts of water. In a water-poor country like Australia, this can make a real difference in the relative economic attractiveness of these strategies. In particular, wide-scale planting of trees to store carbon can be very water-intensive, and we should therefore consider carefully where we do it. However, there is good news too. Reducing our electricity demand through energy efficiency and shifting to renewable sources can not only reduce our carbon footprint, but also our water footprint too. Burning coal for electricity consumes water, so if we can reduce this demand and shift to more sustainable technology, more water may become available for the environment and other uses. The water costs of carbon farming Planting trees is a major plank of Australia’s climate policy, to be delivered by programs such as the Green Army and the 20 Million Trees initiative. Although 20 million trees sounds like a lot, at 1000 trees per hectare it only adds up to about 20,000 hectares. But elsewhere there are millions of hectares that could potentially be planted by the carbon forestry industry. The Carbon Farming Initiative, which allows land owners to earn credit for storing carbon in trees and soils, recognises the water impact of forests as a potential issue, and has regulations in place to manage it. These include a list of eligible planting zones, and limits to tree planting in areas that receive enough rainfall to generate water runoff (at least 600 mm a year), which is aimed at stopping trees from sucking up water from river catchments. But there are several loopholes in the regulations, and the National Water Commission, which reviews the planting zones each year, will be abolished in December. Another way to manage the impact of trees on water is to issue licences for commercial forestry, as is happening in South Australia. While this policy has its opponents, it makes sense that water use is accounted for and that users pay for the water they consume. Trees can provide many other benefits, such as creating animal habitat, slowing erosion, reducing salinity, and moderating flooding. We shouldn’t avoid planting trees as a climate strategy, but it needs to be carefully planned on a region-by-region basis across Australia. Care needs to be taken not to harm river catchments. Bram Souffrou/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA What can we do to lessen the impact? Apart from carefully planning where trees are planted, there are some technology choices that can reduce the water footprint of clean energy. Thermal power stations use water to generate steam and to cool the heat generated in electricity production. On average, Australian coal-fired power plants consume about 1.5 million litres of water for each gigawatt hour of electricity production. The five power stations in Victoria’s Latrobe valley use more than 100 gigalitres of water each year - around 300 million litres every day. The potential adoption of solar thermal or geothermal energy in drier areas of the continent could also lead to excessive water demands. There are several other options for cooling thermal power plan. “Dry-cooling” obviously uses far less water, and has already been used at a few power stations, such as Kogan Creek in Queensland. But as it relies on heat exchange with the atmosphere, such power plants operate less efficiently in hotter weather. A solar thermal power plant nearing completion in Nevada incorporates a hybrid cooling system that uses much less water than conventional systems. This means that water can be used for cooling when air temperatures are too high for dry-cooling alone. Solar photovoltaic and wind generators use very little water directly, although they need to be linked to other energy stores and generators to smooth out their power supply. Existing pumped storage hydropower stations in eastern Australia, currently used to back up coal-fired generators, could be used for this purpose. An issue for arid places everywhere Clearly water conservation is an issue in Australia, which is largely an arid country. Even in Australia’s temperate zones, most water is already allocated to other uses. Currently, California is in drought and facing reductions in hydro generation and forced to look for alternative sources of water to cool power plants. Switching to new energy sources and implementing other mitigation strategies will change the places where water consumption occurs in Australia. In the future, water consumption is likely to drop in coal-dominated places like the Latrobe and Hunter valleys, while increasing in places where efforts are made to store carbon in the landscape, and potentially where new renewable power stations are being built. The issue of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=water shortage">water shortage</a></span> is not going away – in fact, it will become more important as more areas of the world experience increasing drought as a result of climate change. Tackling greenhouse emissions is a priority, but it needs to be done in a way that minimises the impacts on water.

                                Space war is very likely the next frontier for human conflict, and after spending the past few decades with barely any military at all, Japan is taking practical steps to reach for the stars, for wars. According to a source who leaked the story to the Kyodo news agency, the Japanese Defense Ministry is planning on creating a space force made up of Air Self Defense Force personnel by 2019. At first, they'll be using advanced satellite and telescopic observatory technology on earth to track the heavens for dangerous debris like old rocket parts and satellites still floating around in space. Space debris is no joke, but at the same time, the Japanese space watchmen will be working in conjunction with their American allies, updating US Strategic Command with space related intel on the fourth battlefield. That might just mean watching for Chinese ballistic missiles that have been popping up in space of late. Its no secret China and its North Korean ally have openly been testing ICBM technology that can reach low Earth orbit, which makes the neighboring Japanese very nervous. The same source told Kyodo that the Americans and Japanese have been keeping a close watch on Chinese space ambitions since 2007, when the emerging superpower shot down one of its own satellites with a missile. The missile test, an act of showy geopolitical strength, not only sent debris everywhere on a collision course with other satellites, but it demonstrated that the Chinese can blow stuff up in space with the push of a button on earth.  Alarm bells went off for the Americans and Japanese. In May of this year, as Kyodo reports, both countries formally discussed their increased cooperation in space with one another, a strange move belying other, more worldly geopolitical reasons for their sudden interest in space. Spacealong with the cyber realmmust these days be regarded as one of the key domains for military capability alongside land, sea and air, Peter Felstead, a defense expert and editor of Jane's Defense Weekly, told me via email. If you have hi-res eyes in space, that gives you the jump on whether, for example, North Korea is preparing to launch a ballistic missile (one of which flew directly over Japan in 2009). In addition to worrying about thousands of pieces of space debris floating around Earths orbit, the US and Japan are profoundly concerned about the potential for China to dominate the Asia-Pacific region here on planet Earth.  In recent years, tensions between the Chinese and the Japanese have manifested themselves as a lot of sabre rattling over contested islands in the South China sea. The new space race can be viewed as just an extension of that overall chess match to dominate their spheres of influence. And for the same reason the Japanese are tinkering with their World War II-era pacification, which forced them to largely disarm. The emergence of China means the US needs a major military partner to contain the Chinese, while they make their pivot away from the Middle East and into the Pacific. Chinas increasing military might and manoeuvres in places like the South China Sea are a major spur to the upgrading of Japans military capabilities, said Felstead, adding that the North Korean nuclear threat also remains a continuing fear for Japanese national security. This brewing potential Pacific war has sent the Japanese into a military procurement frenzy. After building themselves their biggest naval destroyer since WWII, theyve been buying a lot of fancy new toys in addition to those they engineer on their own. Japan just bought $372 million worth of Northrop Grummans Global Hawk <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> to outfit their new UAV fleet, and they're outfitting a new futuristic navy, and buying F-35s to counter the potential threat of Chinas own, next generation, the J20 stealth fighter. "The Japanese are developing a lot of defense capabilities on their own without the need to buy them," said Felstead. "Japan has built its own warships (including helicopter destroyers), airlifters, [and] tanks. It has also license-produced US aircraft designs for decades and is now a participant in the international F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme."  All of the earthly armaments Japan is making and taking is forecasting a future where space will be inhabited by the same sort of war machines. Even Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-35 that Japan and every other western ally is in line to procure, has designs for a future where space-specific fighters are the norm. They've announced designs for the SR-72 Blackbird, a space-born, unmanned aircraft Lockheed says will be capable of "speeds up to Mach 6, or six times the speed of sound," enabling the plane to creep up on an "adversary" that "would have no time to react or hide." Pitched as an heir to the SR-71, the SR-72 could also be a spy plane, but Lockheed also mentions that hypersonic aircraft, coupled with hypersonic missiles, could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour. The company says it could be ready as early as 2030. In other words, while NATO nations and allies like Japan wait for their long-delayed and over-budget F-35 shipments, the next big ticket purchase could be autonomous space fighters capable of monitoring or shooting down Chinese missiles in the low Earth orbit.  Japan's moves to extend their military ambitions and infrastructure to space is par for the course as compared to their Western allies. Canada's space agency is a wing of the Department of National Defence, and NASA's own connection with the US Army is well documented. In the end, though, the Japanese military's expansion into space is really an evolution of their conflict with China, dating back centuries: An old war in a new frontier.

                                Yoshiki Sasai was a leading stem-cell scientist in Japan.EPA In 1987, my father, a scientist at the US National Institute of Health, killed himself after a member of his lab committed scientific fraud and he got caught up in the investigation. So I found the news that Yoshiki Sasai, a Japanese stem-cell scientist, had allegedly committed suicide in the wake of the STAP controversy deeply disturbing. The STAP controversy began in January over two papers published in the journal Nature. In them, researchers claimed to have developed a simple method of creating embryonic-like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>, called STAP (or stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency). The claim, if true, would have given stem-cell research a big boost. But, within months, problems with the papers were spotted and the researchers' institute deemed that the lead author Haruko Obokata was guilty of scientific misconduct. Sasai, one of the leading stem-cell researchers in Japan, was a co-author on both the papers, which have now been retracted from Nature. He was, however, cleared of any charges of misconduct. Neither was my father involved in fraud. But as one of the senior scientists on the research project, my father bore the brunt of institutional criticism. And he seemed to have been far more disturbed by it than the people who were found guilty of the fraud. It is hard for me not to place at least part of the blame for my father’s death on the way the scientific community responds to scientific misconduct. Obviously, fraud is a terrible thing. Nothing provides as deep an existential threat to the scientific enterprise than making up data. But as bad as it is, there is something deeply ugly about the way the scientific community responds to misconduct. We need to deal swiftly with fraud when it is identified. But time after time I have watched not only the accused, but everyone around them, be treated with such sanctimonious disdain. Imagine what it must be like to have devoted your life to science, and then to discover that someone in your midst – someone you have some role in supervising – has committed the ultimate scientific sin. That itself must be disturbing enough. Indeed I remember how upset my father was as he was trying to prove that fraud had taken place. But then imagine what it must feel like to all of a sudden become the focal point for scrutiny – to experience your colleagues and your field casting you aside. It must feel like your whole world is collapsing around you, and not everybody has the mental strength to deal with that. We are all so confident this could never happen to us, that it must be that somebody in a position of power was lax, or that the environment was flawed. It is there in the institutional response. And it is there in the whispers. I still remember how the faculty in my graduate department at the California Institute of Technology talked about David Baltimore when Thereza Imanishi-Kari, a researcher with whom Baltimore had published a paper in the journal Cell, was accused of scientific fraud. (Imanishi-Kari was eventually deemed not guilty.) Given the horrible incentive structure we have in science today, it is somewhat of a miracle that more people don’t make up results on a routine basis. It is important that we identify, and come down hard, on people who cheat (although I wish this would include the far greater number of people who hype their results – something that is ultimately more damaging than the small number of people who commit fraud). But the next time something like this happens, I am begging you to please be careful about how you respond. Recognise that, while invariably fraud involves a failure not just of honesty but of oversight, most of the people involved are honest, decent scientists.

                                Concerns about security of US-trained Afghan military.EPA/Jalil Rezayee The US major-general killed in an insider attack at a military academy near Kabul is the highest-ranked US casualty since 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Another 15 officers were wounded, including a German brigadier-general, in the attack during a high-level meeting at a new defence academy that was modelled on the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Major-General Harold Greene was a widely admired communications specialist who was in Afghanistan to oversee the handover from US to Afghan forces, a key role that made him a particular target for armed opposition groups. The incident brings into focus the more general state of security in Afghanistan at a time when numerous sources are reporting an upsurge in Taliban capabilities, and just as the great majority of coalition forces are concluding their deployments. Just last week, President Hamid Karzai’s powerful cousin, Hashmat Karzai, was killed at an Eid al-Fitr celebration at his home in Kandahar Province after a well-dressed guest came up to him and detonated a suicide vest. Hashmat Karzai was close to one of the two presidential candidates, Ashraf Ghani – and the long drawn-out failure to complete that election has added to the air of uncertainty affecting the country. Security problems have developed in many areas. One example has been extensive difficulties with the logistic support for the 7,000-strong rapid reaction force, a key new element in the Afghan Army’s forces. This is heavily dependent on 350 mobile strike-force vehicles made by the US arms company Textron, but spares and other support for the force have simply not been made available, mainly because coalition forces have not been able to ensure sufficient security for Textron to supply the stores. Murdered: Harold Greene EPA/US Army Yet another problem is that as many as 200,000 weapons supplied to the Afghan National Army (ANA) are not accounted for. Given the worries over Taliban infiltration of the ANA, not forgetting yesterday’s attack, the impact of this could be considerable, stretching over some years. Taliban rising By the end of this year, most of the coalition forces will have left the country. Even now, very few patrols are being conducted and the great majority of coalition troops are engaged in the complicated withdrawal process in which efforts are being made to remove or destroy the billions of dollars of equipment brought into the country over the past 13 years. The United States hopes to maintain a force of around 10,000 troops in the country compared with its peak deployment of 100,000 three years ago. Both the presidential candidates in Afghanistan support this, but the upsurge in Taliban activity is causing considerable concern. They and other armed opposition groups are making gains across the country, extending their reach beyond their previous main areas of control in the south and south-east, and are threatening supply lines close to the capital, Kabul. These groups are also responsible for an upsurge in casualties among the Afghan army and police force which was established last year but by the end of the year was running at around a hundred killed every month. In recent months the defence and interior ministries have actually stopped publishing the casualty figures for the security forces, but UN statistics show a 24% rise in civilian casualties in the first six months of this year compared to the same period a year ago. A further indication of the problem is that civilian casualties are more likely to stem from direct fighting between Taliban and government forces rather than roadside bombs, which shows the way in which the Taliban are now fighting more openly. This presents a change in their approach because frontal attacks on western troops in the past were just too costly. US withdrawal on hold? One other aspect of the changing environment is important. The Taliban may have increased their levels of action against Afghan forces, but they are unlikely to push this too far during the summer months – what is euphemistically called the “fighting season”. If they do, then the United States might decide to keep larger forces in the country in order to support the Afghan government beyond the end of this year. The current intention is to keep those 10,000 or so troops in Afghanistan, partly to handle training missions but also to support the use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> and maintain Special Forces for searching out groups that might link to al-Qaida elements in Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan. If the Taliban get so strong that they are threatening the very survival of the Kabul government, then the Pentagon will argue for keeping far more troops in the country. From the Taliban perspective it is better to demonstrate some of their power without making this excessive. They can then bide their time over the next year, work out just how powerful US forces still are in the country, and then undermine the government slowly while consolidating their control of substantial parts of the country. The war in Afghanistan is largely forgotten in the West with all the attention on Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Nigeria and elsewhere, but it is far from over. And judging by the killing of General Greene, US involvement in Afghanistan will stretch over many years to come.

                                The news: The world's first commercial space launchpad may not be built in Cape Canaveral or Houston. Instead, the first rockets to lift off from a designated commercial facility will embark from one of North America's poorest — and perhaps, least likely — cities: Brownsville, Texas. Of the Brownsville-Harlingen metro area's nearly half a million residents, 36% live below the national poverty line. Close to a quarter of those 25 or older have only a high school diploma; 37% never graduated high school. Yet this is the city where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> chose to build the world's first commercial launching facility, from which he plans to send up to 12 rockets each year into space. This is huge for Brownsville. Musk was looking for a place at an eastern location relatively close to the equator to take advantage of the Earth's spin. Read More

On Monday, another man who had recently been overseas exhibited symptoms of the disease at NYC's Mount Sinai hospital. Doctors quickly concluded it was probably not <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, but some minor panic ensured nonetheless.

More than 700 West Africans have died, and the battle is far from over. Who is really to blame? How about greedy pharmaceutical companies? Scientists have made great strides in developing an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccine, but so far exactly zero candidates have made it past the stage of clinical trials. Vaccines, which require billions of dollars to research and develop, rely on funds from pharmaceutical companies. So despite the fact that many vaccines have made it to the first level of testing, they often can't surpass the intervening hurdles without a big push from private corporations. Here's the problem: Pharmaceutical companies, for whom decisions must make sense financially, won't take a risk on investing in a vaccine for a disease that only surfaces periodically in low-income countries. Governments and research universities are supposed to help by filling the funding gap. Read More

                                From 1990 to 2010, deaths from chronic kidney disease (CKD) rose by about 82% worldwide—the third largest increase among the top 25 causes of death after <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> (396%) and diabetes (93%). In England, about £1·45 billion was spent on caring for people with CKD in 2009–10, just 1·3% of National Health Service spending, and a substantial proportion of this cost was devoted to renal replacement therapy in the small proportion of patients with kidney failure. In July, the UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its clinical guideline on CKD, aiming to ensure consistent identification of CKD and thereby improve management.

                                There are some articles journal editors will wish they hadn't brought to public attention. But there will also be papers they are immensely grateful to have published. One such Lancet paper is Julio Montaner's truly landmark 2006 viewpoint entitled, rather modestly now looking back, “The case for expanding access to highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] to curb the growth of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> epidemic”. The paper began by charting, since its inception in 1996, the rise and impact of HAART. Montaner and his team went on to hypothesise that, “A prevention-centred approach would therefore argue that treating 100% of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected individuals at once could greatly reduce <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission.

                                AT FIRST glance it would appear that China has gone online, and gone digital, with great gusto. The spectacular rise of internet stars such as Alibaba, Tencent and JD would certainly suggest so. The country now has more smartphone users and households with internet access than any other. Its e-commerce industry, which turned over $300 billion last year, is the world’s biggest. The forthcoming stockmarket flotation of Alibaba may be the largest yet seen.So it is perhaps surprising to hear it argued that much of Chinese business has still not plugged in to the internet and to related trends such as cloud computing and “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” analysis; and therefore that these technologies’ biggest impact on the country’s economy is still to come. That is the conclusion of a report published on July 24th by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), a think-tank run by the eponymous consulting firm. It finds that only one-fifth of Chinese firms are using cloud-based data storage and processing power, for example, compared with three-fifths of American ones. Chinese businesses spend only 2% of their revenues on information technology, half the global average. Even the biggest, most...

                                JUDGING from the condemnation, Facebook just “friended” Satan. The company has been pilloried for academic research it published, showing that by adjusting its users’ news feeds so that a greater proportion of positive or negative items appeared, it could nudge people to post slightly sunnier or gloomier items themselves.

And the most telling bit went unnoticed: the difference in posting behaviour was between 0.04% and 0.1%. It sounds paltry, and is. But to Facebook’s data scientists, it amounted to a smashing victory. “Given the massive scale,” they noted, “even small effects can have large aggregated consequences.”This may indeed be the unspoken secret of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>.
