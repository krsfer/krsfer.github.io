                                Was it the Illuminati?EPA A huge criminal investigation is underway in the Netherlands, following the downing of flight MH17. Ten Dutch prosecutors and 200 policemen are involved in collecting evidence to present at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The investigation may take time to find the real perpetrators, but that hasn’t stopped conspiracy theorists from speculating. Human beings are pattern-seeking creatures. We take the raw material from our senses, and shape it into descriptions, theories and predictions. The conspiracies that now surround MH17 and prior to that flight MH370 are an example of the same urge to order. In the case of MH370, which crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, the disappearance of an airliner with 239 people on board, begs for explanation, and so the theorists step in and start chattering on their blogs. The speculations around the destruction of MH17 have a slightly different character, perhaps because “the facts” seem to be clearer, and the key agents more obvious. After all, the grammar of any conspiracy theory about an event begins with the “who benefits” question. Searching for logic So who would have wanted the second Malaysia Airlines plane to be shot down? The Russians and the Ukrainian rebels don’t have much to gain from being portrayed as the murderers of 298 people. So if there wasn’t an advantage then they wouldn’t have done it, which is where the wheels of conspiracy logic then begin to grind. All the explanations then assume that the guilt of the Russians and their proxies is what “they” want us to believe, but that the truth is more complicated. The next obvious candidates are the Ukrainian government, attempting to swing international sympathy against the rebels and their supporters. Or, that the Ukrainians were actually trying to kill Vladimir Putin, whose official jet was flying back over Europe at the same time, and bore similar markings to MH17. Israel is invoked in many conspiracies of course, so there are suggestions that the jet was shot down in order to distract attention from the first day of the offensive in Gaza. Another account then focuses on the fact that there were delegates from a conference about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> on board, and hence that they were killed in order to prevent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> research from making progress. EPA The biggest swathe of conspiracies suggests that MH370 and MH17 are actually the same plane. The first plane, they claim, was hijacked and flown somewhere secret to be stored for a while. It was then rigged with explosives, flown over Donestsk and blown up in order to implicate one of the parties. A large amount of evidence about expired passports, parachutes seen descending from the plane, and photos of the damage on parts of the fuselage are all deployed in order to support suggestions as to who might be responsible – the American intelligence agency CIA, organised crime, the Illuminati and so on. Some of these accounts are offensive, or mad, or both. There are others who are busy claiming that the mad and offensive conspiracies are being disseminated by those who are trying to distract us from seeing “the truth”. Anyone who takes a position on a conspiracy is entangled within it, whether they like or not. And that includes this piece, of course. As Mel Gibson’s character Jerry Fletcher says in the 1997 movie Conspiracy Theory: A good conspiracy is unprovable. I mean, if you can prove it, it means they screwed up somewhere along the line. All conspiracy theorists are not mad Now Jerry Fletcher might sound crazy, but consider the alternatives. The first would be to say that there are no conspiracies. This is clearly mad, because we know that powerful forces do try to arrange the world for their benefit. The second gulf of Tonkin incident which justified US involvement in Vietnam was proven to be a fiction, and there is plenty of evidence about “false flag” and similar covert operations activities by everyone from the CIA to the British secret service MI6. Add to that the activities of global elites at Davos and the routine deceit practised by capitalist corporations and you would be naive to believe that the world is what it seems. The other alternative is less exciting. That would be to say that there are coincidences and mistakes, and that they can shape the world too. The fact that the two jets just happened to be from the same airline, or that an under-trained, trigger-happy separatist couldn’t recognise a passenger plane, are events which are disqualified within conspiracy thinking. Their assumption is that there is a logic to events, a pattern to the world, and that stuff doesn’t just happen. It is only in this sense that conspiracy theorists are mad, because most of their reasoning is perfectly sane. The problem is distinguishing the stupid accidents from the cunning plans, and that is something that none of us are terribly good at.

The death toll, which passed the 1,000-mark over a week ago, soared higher from last Thursday to Saturday. The epidemic, which has hit four west African nations since it broke out in Guinea at the start of the year, is by far the deadliest since <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> was discovered four decades ago in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. As a result, Sierra Leone's total case count increased to 848 and its death toll to 365.

                                Throwing in the towel. Mark Probst, CC BY-SA Despite the many awareness-raising campaigns on the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a walk along any tourist beach will tell you just how many sun worshippers continue to soak up the sun excessively. And despite our use of all kinds of sunscreens, the statistics show a constant increase in the number of skin cancer cases. Why? Things that protect us against harmful rays from the sun include clothing such as hats and longer sleeves and sunglasses. But topical sun protection from sunscreens is ideal as it allows us to be more free. These products only appeared on the market in the 1930s and were promoted as tanning <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span>. The formulation of sunscreen products is complex and the first ones were especially flawed – because the UV-filters were used at low concentrations and their effectiveness was limited in UVB light range. Since then, the history of topical sun protection has been marked by milestones, or scandals as we could call them. Let’s not forget the Bergasol affair in the 1980s. Products were formulated with bergapten, a photo-sensitising molecule that is found in bergamot essential oil and other oils, but which had no place whatsoever in this type of product because mixed with light it can cause skin irritation. Today we have the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) to guide us. SPF is a universal indicator that testifies to the effectiveness of a product against UV (which includes UVA and UVB wavelengths), which can penetrate and damage the skin and cells. SPF is worked out by putting on a thick layer of a suncream on in the lab and working out the difference it makes based on a multiplier – so if unprotected skin took 15 minutes to burn, a sunscreen with an SPF of 10 would take 150 minutes, and SPF30 would take 450 minutes. This method of calculating protection is voted for overwhelmingly by manufacturers. Apart from the clear ethical shortcomings of this method (it does, after all involve irradiating volunteers for not insignificant periods or doses), we’ve discovered and revealed a certain number of potential biases. We’ve tested many products each year since 2000 and would say that about a third have much less protection than their SPF would suggest. Concerns have previously been raised about SPF performance out in the real world and a recent investigation by Which? consumer magazine found three suncreams – Piz Buin, Malibu and Hawaiian Tropic – had lower protection than the SPF30 on the bottle. Anti-inflammatories We’ve highlighted that a certain number of ingredients found in suncreams including allantoin (a molecule found in Symphytum officinale, a plant more commonly known as comfrey but which is now mostly synthetic), bisabolol (found in chamomile, also now mostly synthetic), and liquorice extracts, are likely to inhibit the appearance of redness due to their anti-inflammatory properties. As redness is a clinical sign that is used to determine SPF under current procedures, it can result in an overestimation of the SPF of products that contain these molecules. Using products high in anti-inflammatories can give a false sense of security – your DNA is still being damaged, you just don’t see or feel it happening. We have also demonstrated that the majority of filters approved in sunscreen products, including salicylates, benzophenones, PABA by-products, cinnamates and octocrylene, are highly anti-inflammatory. The problem is that despite this UV-filters are an essential ingredient for sunscreens to work. Our current work has been looking at how long these anti-inflammatory effects last and we’ve found that this can be several hours. It’s worth bearing in mind that any molecule that is likely to inhibit the development of the redness, regardless of what other action it has, will plays a part in overestimating SPF using current measures. Another major problem with topical sun protection comes from mineral products – titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide – whether or not they are organic. Despite some claims, high SPF factors in sunscreens (50, 50+) can’t be obtained with this type of sunscreen. Again the difference is due to an anti-flammatory effect and people who use these type of products for high SPF won’t be well protected. A better way to test? Instead, we think there should be a new standardised system of testing products based on chemical testing in the lab that only considers the optical properties of filters. This is the only way of quantifying the real effectiveness of sunscreen products. Sunscreen products are different from all others; they can actively protect against skin cancers. And crucially, we have trust in them so happily stay out in the sun longer, thinking they’re working as well as they claim. It would therefore be appropriate that they return to being classed as a medication, as they are in the US. The marketing of ineffective sunscreen products today will have to take a share of the responsibility in skin cancers – we can’t leave this heavy responsibility to the cosmetics industry.

                                Personal dispositions, feelings and beliefs may play a decisive role in explaining why people become radicalised.EPA/Stringer So far, the ongoing discussions about radicalisation of extremists both at home and abroad have tended to emphasise its sociological aspects. It has focused on concepts such as the religion and social environments of individuals. However, psychological accounts of extremist activity are infrequent, and it is often forgotten that only a few of those who hold strong ideological, political and religious views get involved in violent acts. Personal dispositions, feelings and beliefs may play a decisive role in explaining why people become radicalised. Nastiness, grudge and excuse Both conceptual analyses and empirical psychological studies that I have undertaken in the past have shown there are three main ingredients of militant extremist mindset. The first of these ingredients is nastiness, as captured by strong endorsement of statements approving of violent acts, such as “killing is justified when it is an act of revenge”, or “we should respond to terror with terror”. The second is grudge, which can take two forms. One is a direct reference to the “west”, shown in statements such as “terrorism in the form of unfair torture and execution without trial is carried out daily by many western countries” and “the west is degraded by its lack of dignified values, its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> epidemic, and its alcohol and drug addiction”. Grudge’s other manifestation is a more generalised belief in the vile world: “evil has been re-incarnated in the cult of markets and the rule of multinational companies”. The final ingredient is excuse. Although there are several forms of excuse, a common feature is justifications in people’s own minds of the nasty and violent things they tend to condone. In some cases it is with reference to God: “only one’s own God is the true God”. In other cases it is the trust in divine power: “at a critical moment, a divine power will step in to help our people”. These three components were identified within the general populations in several countries, including the US, Serbia and China. These aspects of militant extremist mindset are generic in nature and are not focused on Islamic terrorism. One does not need to become a terrorist if they endorse moderately all three ingredients of a militant extremist mindset. Even a strong endorsement of one or even two of the three components is unlikely to prompt a person to spring into action. However, high endorsement of all three components may lead a person to act. And if a group has high ratings on all three components, chances are that at least some members of the group may become potential recruits for a radical cause. Although the measure may be useful for identifying groups prone to terrorism, no justification can be made to use the militant extremist mindset for profiling purposes. What can be changed? Grudge should be more open to change than either nastiness or excuse. Nastiness is a social attitude akin to dogmatism and authoritarianism that are known to be hard to modify. Grudge is only partly a psychological internal state of the person and the other part – that is, the outside threat that causes unhappiness or fear – may be open to intervention. Education and media can play a crucial role. Policy response Governments can continue with campaigns to educate people of the benefits of immigration, equal opportunity for all citizens and the acceptance of diversity as well as the need for vigorous action to secure immigrants’ equal rights and promotion of the democratic process. Countering “protest counter-culture” can be achieved by directly engaging in discussions with counter-culture groups, monitoring their development and, eventually as a last resort, using police methods if the situation gets too heated. These efforts, perhaps, should be increased. Monitoring the level and changes in extremists' mindset In a recent interview, retiring ASIO chief David Irvine said that a small number of people who have very distorted views that propel them towards violence leading to mass casualties are a real concern. 150 Australians, included Khaled Sharrouf, are believed to be fighting in Iraq and Syria. Twitter Irvine added that the number of threats that ASIO is looking at, in terms of the numbers of people, has grown substantially with the Syrian conflict. Translated into the language of militant extremist mindset, this means that “grudge” among the people who already have an “excuse” has increased. Any policy response needs to account for the “nasty” ones within the protest counter-culture groups. Prudent governments should monitor the extent and the strength of the militant extremist mindset in its population and especially among the young, including older adolescents and students. If this had been done in the past, the warning signs would have been detectable ahead of the realisation that 150 Australians are engaged in terrorist activities in Syria and Iraq. Psychological research into radicalisation may complement political science and religious studies in countering terrorism in western society. Monitoring the strength of militant extremist mindset endorsements in different communities within the Australian population could be helpful. Finally, it may be useful to establish regular polling practices that would gauge the extent of radicalisation over time and in reaction to terrorist-related political acts at home and globally.

                                Will anyone jump on the Tesla patent bandwagon?raneko/Flickr, CC BY With the much-anticipated arrival next month of electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla’s Model S to Australian shores, it’s a good time to revisit Tesla’s pledge to freely share patents. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>, co-founder and CEO of Tesla Motors, wrote a statement on the company’s blog entitled All Our Patent Are Belong To You back in June. In a short announcement giving some context to the company’s decision, Musk claims that the electric vehicle industry as a whole would benefit from an “open source” approach towards innovation. His pledge to the market that “Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology” spawned headlines around the world, and purportedly armed those who are opponents of the patent system. Commentators such as Eric Lane and Rajiv Rao were quick to suggest that Tesla is abandoning their patents and making them freely available – but the reality is quite the opposite. There are ‘known unknowns’ <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> at the reopening of the former NUMMI plant, now Tesla Motors. Steve Jurvetson/Flickr, CC BY Musk has since been reported as saying the new policy is not an abandonment in favour of some notion of the public domain. In fact, by allowing others to use its patented technologies, Tesla is suggesting that other electric vehicle manufacturing companies would also benefit from adopting this approach in the quest of developing a common technology platform, known as a cross license. With cross licensing, manufacturers are essentially prevented from filing patent infringement lawsuits against each other and recently corporations have recognised those benefits. Some of the world’s biggest information technology companies, including Google and Canon, last month banded together to form the License on Transfer (LOT) network, which describes itself as “a new kind of royalty-free cross-license”. Tesla’s caveat “in good faith” also calls into question whether the patent pledge is a genuine gesture of goodwill. But this does not amount to Tesla “taking down the patent wall”, but rather an attempt to control the direction of the industry. Tesla’s announcement is not entirely without precedent. Swedish carmaker Volvo patented the design for the V-type three-point safety belt in 1959 and made it freely available. The new safety belt soon afterwards became the industry standard for vehicles worldwide. Sean Dreilinger, CC BY-NC-SA There is further evidence of the use of this strategy in the past by companies such as IBM and Google in the information and communications technology sector, where such pledges have been used to ensure industry-wide adoption of interoperability standards. Long live the patent system Patents provide the owner (or patentee) exclusive rights to make, use or sell an invention covered by those rights for a limited period of time. Despite Tesla’s decision to make its old patents available, it does not stop the company from seeking patents for its newer technologies. Keeping in mind that Musk was able to secure venture capital funding on the basis of securing patented technologies in the first place, it now seems that he can shift the strategic focus of those commercial assets towards building goodwill in the marketplace. Musk on The Colbert Report: ‘We kind of want the car to be your friend.’ George Mason University law professor Adam Mossoff points out: “Tesla’s new policy is an example of Musk exercising patent rights, not abandoning them.” The real value We are yet to hear whether other manufacturers have taken up Tesla’s offer. But what we do know is Tesla will only continue to prosper if the entire industry succeeds. In other words, it needs commercial partners to improve battery technologies, build charging stations and band together to change public perception. The latest move by Tesla and its partner, Panasonic, will see the construction of the new Gigafactory, which will produce long range battery packs for Tesla’s electric vehicles. In the end, the impact of Tesla’s announcement may depend on to what extent other players in the industry are willing to invest in manufacturing vehicles using Tesla’s patented (and patent-pending) technologies.

                                An elite cabal of scientists has gathered in Germany, where, in badly lit rooms, it hashes out grand schemes to control the planets climate. Okay, comparing geoengineering—or climate engineering, or the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earths climate system, in order to moderate global warming, as Britains Royal Society puts it—to mad science supervillainy is a little predictable at this point. But I just couldnt help myself. This is the Climate Engineering Conference 2014, after all. It's the first major international, interdisciplinary meeting convened to examine, very seriously, an idea that in any other era would literally have seemed either incomprehensible. Or blasphemous: artificially changing the Earths climate itself. Hacking the planet, in the hackneyed parlance of our times. Three hundred dignitaries, scholars, and scientists have traveled to Germany from 40 different nations for the occasion. The conferences aim, according to its charter, is to bring together the diverse stakeholders involved in the debate—including academic researchers and representatives from the policy and civil society communities… to address comprehensively and in a balanced manner the technical, geophysical/geochemical, ethical, and social contexts in which the idea of engineering the climate is being contemplated. Geoengineerings MO is, essentially, to correct for global warming. The thinking goes that we humans are cooking the planet with a torrent of greenhouse gas emissions—34 billion tons of carbon dioxide alone a year, and counting—and weve proved incapable of slowing down in time to avert planetary disaster. So we need some cheat codes. We either suck vast quantities of CO2 out of the atmosphere, or find a way to bounce back enough sunlight to balance out the the CO2 weve already stuffed up there. These are the two major kinds of geoengineering—carbon dioxide reduction (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM)—and all manner of both are on the docket this week. More specifically, were talking injecting the atmosphere with aerosols to bounce back sunlight (SRM), giant mechanical honeycombs that absorb carbon (CDR), ocean <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> that spew out clouds (SRM), mirrors launched into space (SRM), or dumping vast amounts of iron into the ocean (CDR). Those schemes are just the tip of the iceberg, too. All manner of ideas; some bizarre, some feasible, some exorbitantly expensive, some disturbingly cheap, will be brought to the table this week. And just the fact that leading scientists, policymakers, and delegates will be discussing these ideas at CEC 2014 is milestone enough. In the international and academic communities, geoengineering is still something of a scientific non grata: a field wrapped in taboo wrapped in enigma. Its so loaded that many argue even talking about it is a bad idea; that by even positing that geoengineering is a possibility, these luminaries are detracting from what should be the true and only order of the day on the climate front—transitioning away from fossil fuels to clean energy, and drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Youll hear the term moral hazard raised a lot in conversations about geoengineering. The implication is that even by floating the idea that climate change can be solved with a techno-fix, its presenting humanity with a get-out-of-jail-free card that could erode the impetus for tougher action. Yet geoengineering has wormed its way further into the social and cultural consciousness since the Nobel prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen published one of the first widely-considered papers on the subject just less than a decade ago. Since then, there have been New Yorker articles and general audience books and an increasing number of policy and academic institutions publicly deliberating over geoengineering. And, perhaps, there's also a slowly growing familiarity and creeping willingness to consider this risky nuclear option from average citizens. For better or for worse, were talking about hacking the planet. Lets be clear: This is fairly terrifying stuff, from every angle. Nearly all of those involved admit that should geonengineering ever be attempted, there will be unintended consequences. Weather patterns could shift, temps might grow too cold; there could be drought. Meanwhile, the fact that humanity has backed itself so far into a carbonic corner as to need to consider these drastic options at all is hellish enough. And so, lawmakers, scientists, and civic leaders will sit in a hotel in Berlin and stare this possibility in the face: What are the options? Which are the less bad ones? Which have been tested? Which can reflect the most sunlight, draw down the most carbon, for the cheapest? What geoengineering scheme gets the planet the most bang for its buck? Which are so cheap that we need worry about rogue geoengineers going ahead with planetary-scale experiments, intents altruistic or no? Whos going to stop them? How do we govern any of this in the first place? Who gets to geongineer, if at all, and where, and for how long, and under whose auspices? These are the questions that will be asked this week, out loud, in public by esteemed scientists and public figures, in the new twisted hot reality that is the Anthropocene. They've already proposed a framework with which to govern future planet-hacking experiments.  All of the above is why I had to be there. This moment feels heavy and historic, exhilarating and exhausting: Were actually taking this seriously. If humankind is going to end up engineering the climate, the seeds of how it will happen will likely be sown this week, here in Berlin.

                                An elite cabal of scientists has gathered in Germany, where, in badly lit rooms, it hashes out grand schemes to control the planets climate. Okay, comparing geoengineering—or climate engineering, or the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earths climate system, in order to moderate global warming, as Britains Royal Society puts it—to mad science supervillainy is a little predictable at this point. But I just couldnt help myself. This is the Climate Engineering Conference 2014, after all. It's the first major international, interdisciplinary meeting convened to examine, very seriously, an idea that in any other era would literally have seemed either incomprehensible. Or blasphemous: artificially changing the Earths climate itself. Hacking the planet, in the hackneyed parlance of our times. Three hundred dignitaries, scholars, and scientists have traveled to Germany from 40 different nations for the occasion. The conferences aim, according to its charter, is to bring together the diverse stakeholders involved in the debate—including academic researchers and representatives from the policy and civil society communities… to address comprehensively and in a balanced manner the technical, geophysical/geochemical, ethical, and social contexts in which the idea of engineering the climate is being contemplated. Geoengineerings MO is, essentially, to correct for global warming. The thinking goes that we humans are cooking the planet with a torrent of greenhouse gas emissions—34 billion tons of carbon dioxide alone a year, and counting—and weve proved incapable of slowing down in time to avert planetary disaster. So we need some cheat codes. We either suck vast quantities of CO2 out of the atmosphere, or find a way to bounce back enough sunlight to balance out the the CO2 weve already stuffed up there. These are the two major kinds of geoengineering—carbon dioxide reduction (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM)—and all manner of both are on the docket this week. More specifically, were talking injecting the atmosphere with aerosols to bounce back sunlight (SRM), giant mechanical honeycombs that absorb carbon (CDR), ocean <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> that spew out clouds (SRM), mirrors launched into space (SRM), or dumping vast amounts of iron into the ocean (CDR). Those schemes are just the tip of the iceberg, too. All manner of ideas; some bizarre, some feasible, some exorbitantly expensive, some disturbingly cheap, will be brought to the table this week. And just the fact that leading scientists, policymakers, and delegates will be discussing these ideas at CEC 2014 is milestone enough. In the international and academic communities, geoengineering is still something of a scientific non grata: a field wrapped in taboo wrapped in enigma. Its so loaded that many argue even talking about it is a bad idea; that by even positing that geoengineering is a possibility, these luminaries are detracting from what should be the true and only order of the day on the climate front—transitioning away from fossil fuels to clean energy, and drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Youll hear the term moral hazard raised a lot in conversations about geoengineering. The implication is that even by floating the idea that climate change can be solved with a techno-fix, its presenting humanity with a get-out-of-jail-free card that could erode the impetus for tougher action. Yet geoengineering has wormed its way further into the social and cultural consciousness since the Nobel prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen published one of the first widely-considered papers on the subject just less than a decade ago. Since then, there have been New Yorker articles and general audience books and an increasing number of policy and academic institutions publicly deliberating over geoengineering. And, perhaps, there's also a slowly growing familiarity and creeping willingness to consider this risky nuclear option from average citizens. For better or for worse, were talking about hacking the planet. Lets be clear: This is fairly terrifying stuff, from every angle. Nearly all of those involved admit that should geonengineering ever be attempted, there will be unintended consequences. Weather patterns could shift, temps might grow too cold; there could be drought. Meanwhile, the fact that humanity has backed itself so far into a carbonic corner as to need to consider these drastic options at all is hellish enough. And so, lawmakers, scientists, and civic leaders will sit in a hotel in Berlin and stare this possibility in the face: What are the options? Which are the less bad ones? Which have been tested? Which can reflect the most sunlight, draw down the most carbon, for the cheapest? What geoengineering scheme gets the planet the most bang for its buck? Which are so cheap that we need worry about rogue geoengineers going ahead with planetary-scale experiments, intents altruistic or no? Whos going to stop them? How do we govern any of this in the first place? Who gets to geongineer, if at all, and where, and for how long, and under whose auspices? These are the questions that will be asked this week, out loud, in public by esteemed scientists and public figures, in the new twisted hot reality that is the Anthropocene. They've already proposed a framework with which to govern future planet-hacking experiments.  All of the above is why I had to be there. This moment feels heavy and historic, exhilarating and exhausting: Were actually taking this seriously. If humankind is going to end up engineering the climate, the seeds of how it will happen will likely be sown this week, here in Berlin. Stay tuned.

                                The zombie ant fungus is the stuff of parasitic lore. Its mission typically goes something like this: an ant just out doing ant things happens to get dusted with the funguss spores, which punch through the ants exoskeleton using a combination of enzyme action and mechanical force (a kind of drilling using hair-like protrusions).  Once inside the ants guts, the fungus, known properly as Ophiocordyceps camponoti-rufipedis, grows as free-living yeast cells, until after a couple of days, when the colonizing fungus begins producing nerve toxins. These toxins instruct the ant to find the fungus-friendly underside of some leaf, where the ant latches on.  Finally, a phallic stalk of fungus punches through the back of the ants neck area (if an ant had a neck), and a new dusting of spores is released, quite possibly onto the exoskeleton of a new ant host. The process repeats. Yes, it's grisly. According to open-access research published this week in the journal PLOS One, ant colonies are actually quite good at defending themselves from this sort of parasitic attack. Ants demonstrate something called social immunity, which the paper describes as, mounted collective actions to prevent and control diseases spread in benefit of themselves and the others.  3D maps of foraging trail and monthly-infected ants surrounding ant colonies in Atlantic rainforest, Brazil/PLOS One This keeps the fungus limited in its attack range, forcing it to deploy its spores outside of the ant colony threshold rather than inside, where those spores might do a lot more harm and possibly lead to colony collapse. In long-term field observations of ant colonies—the first examination of this particular fungus/ant interaction outside of the lab setting—the researchers found that while 100 percent of the populations showed some fungal infection, no colonies failed. The study involved placing ants infected with the zombie fungus inside of healthy ant colonies, with the goal being new observations of how the colony as a whole responds to their zombified kin.  For the nest containing live ants, 9 (64 percent) out of 14 [infected] cadavers were removed from the leaf they were attached to and it was not possible to find them, the study reports. The leaves were recovered but not the cadavers, suggesting they had been broken up by the live ants. The fungus in the remaining 5 cadavers (36 percent) did not grow the stroma correctly. Within the 14 samples placed in the bucket containing only nest material (absence of live ants), 8 (53 percent) of them did not grow at all. The number of dead ants observed at four nests. While deaths weren't eliminated, they were controlled. Image: PLOS One The conclusion: the fungal parasite was incapable of reaching the infective stage inside ant nests, whether ants were present or not. The suggestion is that ants build their nests to be resistant to the proper development of the zombifying fungus spore-producing stalk (the thing that erupts from the ants carcass).  The growth inside the nest may be constrained, primarily, by the physical limitations, the paper explains. To successfully develop, the stroma must grow roughly one body length of the ant and this growth is perpendicular to the posterior-anterior axis of the ant to reach the successful development of the fungus. Secondly, social insects are known to control the nest climate, and O. unilateralis s.l. has been shown to be very sensitive to microclimate. It appears that the zombie ant fungus acts as something of a chronic infection for ant colonies, something that burdens but doesnt destroy outright. It's almost like how we've come to approach <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection in humans—it's an illness that can possibly be controlled but not cured.  Although we did not observe colony collapse, we also did not observe any colonies clearing the infection, the study says. For each month we conducted the census, we found new dead ants surrounding the colonies. If that isnt yet a storyline within the human-zombie canon, consider it a freebie. Its been thought that the parasite/ant colony relationship above has been something of an arms race, with colonies getting better at defending and the fungus getting better at spreading its spores. A final note in the study is that this might not be the case at all, and perhaps the two would-be antagonists have more of a mutually beneficial relationship.  The ants that are most likely to get infected by the fungus are, after all, the oldest and most expendable in the colony. (In the assembly line structure of an ant colony, the oldest get sent out the farthest.) And so by infecting a colonys weakest members, the fungus keeps the colony strong.  Rather than going to war against the fungus—which would likely mean pushing its anti-fungal abilities outside of the colony—they may both be following quite stable evolutionary strategies in which the parasite is tolerated by the host. And if that isnt yet a storyline within the human-zombie canon, consider it a freebie.

                                The zombie ant fungus is the stuff of parasitic lore. Its mission typically goes something like this: an ant just out doing ant things happens to get dusted with the funguss spores, which punch through the ants exoskeleton using a combination of enzyme action and mechanical force (a kind of drilling using hair-like protrusions).  Once inside the ants guts, the fungus, known properly as Ophiocordyceps camponoti-rufipedis, grows as free-living yeast cells, until after a couple of days, when the colonizing fungus begins producing nerve toxins. These toxins instruct the ant to find the fungus-friendly underside of some leaf, where the ant latches on.  Finally, a phallic stalk of fungus punches through the back of the ants neck area (if an ant had a neck), and a new dusting of spores is released, quite possibly onto the exoskeleton of a new ant host. The process repeats. Yes, it's grisly. According to open-access research published this week in the journal PLOS One, ant colonies are actually quite good at defending themselves from this sort of parasitic attack. Ants demonstrate something called social immunity, which the paper describes as, mounted collective actions to prevent and control diseases spread in benefit of themselves and the others.  3D maps of foraging trail and monthly-infected ants surrounding ant colonies in Atlantic rainforest, Brazil/PLOS One This keeps the fungus limited in its attack range, forcing it to deploy its spores outside of the ant colony threshold rather than inside, where those spores might do a lot more harm and possibly lead to colony collapse. In long-term field observations of ant colonies—the first examination of this particular fungus/ant interaction outside of the lab setting—the researchers found that while 100 percent of the populations showed some fungal infection, no colonies failed. The study involved placing ants infected with the zombie fungus inside of healthy ant colonies, with the goal being new observations of how the colony as a whole responds to their zombified kin.  For the nest containing live ants, 9 (64 percent) out of 14 [infected] cadavers were removed from the leaf they were attached to and it was not possible to find them, the study reports. The leaves were recovered but not the cadavers, suggesting they had been broken up by the live ants. The fungus in the remaining 5 cadavers (36 percent) did not grow the stroma correctly. Within the 14 samples placed in the bucket containing only nest material (absence of live ants), 8 (53 percent) of them did not grow at all. The number of dead ants observed at four nests. While deaths weren't eliminated, they were controlled. Image: PLOS One The conclusion: the fungal parasite was incapable of reaching the infective stage inside ant nests, whether ants were present or not. The suggestion is that ants build their nests to be resistant to the proper development of the zombifying fungus spore-producing stalk (the thing that erupts from the ants carcass).  The growth inside the nest may be constrained, primarily, by the physical limitations, the paper explains. To successfully develop, the stroma must grow roughly one body length of the ant and this growth is perpendicular to the posterior-anterior axis of the ant to reach the successful development of the fungus. Secondly, social insects are known to control the nest climate, and O. unilateralis s.l. has been shown to be very sensitive to microclimate. It appears that the zombie ant fungus acts as something of a chronic infection for ant colonies, something that burdens but doesnt destroy outright. It's almost like how we've come to approach <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection in humans—it's an illness that can possibly be controlled but not cured.  Although we did not observe colony collapse, we also did not observe any colonies clearing the infection, the study says. For each month we conducted the census, we found new dead ants surrounding the colonies. If that isnt yet a storyline within the human-zombie canon, consider it a freebie. Its been thought that the parasite/ant colony relationship above has been something of an arms race, with colonies getting better at defending and the fungus getting better at spreading its spores. A final note in the study is that this might not be the case at all, and perhaps the two would-be antagonists have more of a mutually beneficial relationship.  The ants that are most likely to get infected by the fungus are, after all, the oldest and most expendable in the colony. (In the assembly line structure of an ant colony, the oldest get sent out the farthest.) And so by infecting a colonys weakest members, the fungus keeps the colony strong.  Rather than going to war against the fungus—which would likely mean pushing its anti-fungal abilities outside of the colony—they may both be following quite stable evolutionary strategies in which the parasite is tolerated by the host. And if that isnt yet a storyline within the human-zombie canon, consider it a freebie.

                                The blurring of the line between the military and the police, especially in the US, is now on the political agenda following recent events in Ferguson, Missouri.EPA/Roberto Rodriguez Anyone watching the footage coming out of Ferguson, Missouri in recent days would be forgiven for thinking they had tuned into a scene from a combat zone, rather than suburban America. There has been a public outcry over the heavily militarised response of local law enforcement to protests following the police shooting of a young black man, Michael Brown. But is this just a one off, or are police becoming more militarised in their responses to mass public protest? The nature of policing Policing is an occupation different from any other. It is one of the few civilian occupations where you are able to possess a firearm and other lethal weapons and are authorised to use deadly force in certain justifiable situations. Police are paramilitary in that they rely on rank structure for command and control; their members wear the same uniform; they have access to substantial weaponry and are all working towards a common purpose. Police services have a strong organisational culture and to some degree are isolated from mainstream society, often socialising within the policing subculture. American criminologist Peter Kraska describes police militarisation as the process whereby civilian police increasingly draw from, and model themselves around, the doctrines of militarism and the military model. He highlights four particular areas where police provide tangible evidence of this: material, organisational, cultural and operational indicators. The US and decentralised policing Part of the problem in the US is that many police services are small municipal departments that lack both resources and professionalism. This is a by-product of having a highly decentralised law enforcement environment. The Ferguson Police Department, for instance, consists of 72 personnel including 54 commissioned officers and 18 civilian support staff. The UK recognised this problem and has recently undertaken steps to centralise policing services. In Australia there are highly centralised large policing services in each state. Centralisation provides the operational benefits of homogeneous command and control, capacity for resources and increased professionalisation. One of the criticisms in Ferguson is that at one stage there were four different police services present at the protest – the Ferguson police, the St Louis County police (where Ferguson is located), police from the City of St Louis and police from the Missouri Highway Patrol. The rise of the ‘warrior cop’ The blurring of the line between the military and the police, especially in the US, is now on the political agenda. Walter Olson, of libertarian American thinktank the Cato Institute, criticised the rising militarisation of law enforcement as illustrated in Ferguson: Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? Olson was not alone in his criticism of the heavy-handed response of law enforcement in Ferguson. Republican senator Rand Paul used the Ferguson case to argue for a reversal of the current US trend of supplying military hardware for law enforcement purposes. Author Radley Balko has catalogued the rise of the warrior cop and the increasing convergence of military and policing operational doctrines. He illustrates how SWAT teams (heavily armed special weapons teams) have proliferated from the mid-1970s in the US: The country’s first official SWAT team started in the late 1960s in Los Angeles. By 1975, there were approximately 500 such units. Today, there are thousands. SWAT teams deployed in police raids in the US increased from 3000 per year in the 1980s to approximately 45,000 by 2007. Police in Ferguson have used tear gas to quell protesters. EPA/Robert Cohen All Australian police services have a SWAT team-equivalent, but their deployment is more judicious. For instance, the Victorian Special Operations Group (SOG) requires the permission of an Assistant Commissioner to deploy. The Queensland Special Emergency and Response Team can only be deployed to pre-planned operations that are high-risk situations by a deputy commissioner or delegate. In 2011, the Victorian SOG completed 349 operations. They dealt with four sieges, affected tactical entry into ten buildings, conducted 54 high-risk arrests and target intercepts and 36 contain-and-call operations. None resulted in fatalities. In some cases in Australia, the use of these specialist groups has actually declined. In 2013, the New South Wales ombudsman raised concerns that the call-out of the State Protection Group had actually fallen by 50% over the previous six years. Military hardware for police purposes Military assets and technology have also been brought within the policing sphere. In Queensland, police are currently using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s to provide “situational awareness”. The Queensland Police Service (QPS) has flagged the use of military-style <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s used in Afghanistan for deployment during the G20 summit. Many Australian police services use other military hardware. Western Australian Police, for example, use the Bearcat armoured vehicle. Queensland police also recently purchased Remington R4s, a military assault rifle, for use by general duty officers. Engagement and accountability The images from Ferguson are cause for concern. Armed snipers are scoping the protesters. And yet, a line of officers in riot gear also stand in plain view in front of the protesters. Victoria Police was criticised for its response to Occupy Melbourne protests. AAP/Julian Smith These images are contradictory. If there was any threat of an armed person in the crowd, officers would not be standing in plain view. Conversely, if there was no intelligence as to armed persons in the crowd, then there is no justification for armed snipers to be poised. In Australia, the reaction of various police services to Occupy protests was vividly different. Victoria Police used extreme force to remove protesters with subsequent complaints against police. Yet when faced with similar Occupy protests in Western Australia, police used a more successful community engagement approach. The use of force by any police service needs to be accountable. Some police services are taking progressive steps by utilising technology – such as body cameras – that will actually increase public confidence in police actions. One Californian police service has attributed a 60% decrease in use of force and an 88% reduction in complaints to the implementation of body cameras. The police service involved was similar in size to Ferguson Police Department, but the lessons learnt could not be more different.

                                This is carnal science fiction cinema.Sancho McCann/Flickr I will often say to my film students that if you want to know what aches a culture at a particular historical juncture then you need to visit and spend time with the catastrophic imagination of science fiction. For it is in the restless dreaming of future horizons where the hopes and fears of the present are laid bare. Showing at the Melbourne International Film Festival in a lush restored 35mm print and with its original montage ending restored, Phase IV - the only film to be directed by the exquisite poster and title sequence designer, Saul Bass - explores what happens when humankind is threatened by hyper-intelligent ants intent on colonising Earth. Trailer for Phase IV (1974). Set in the Arizona desert – but filmed at Pinewood Studios in England and on-location in Kenya – Phase IV narrates the struggle between two scientists, James Lesko (Michael Murphy) and Ernest Hubbs (Nigel Davenport) as they seek to understand and overcome the mysterious unification of all ant colonies and the (alien) hive mind that controls and advances their collective cause. It is suggested that if Lesko and Hubbs cannot stop these super ants, then human civilisation is doomed. Doomed, I tell you. Doomsday visions Visually and aurally the film is indebted to a heady mixture of influences including the wildlife documentary; the anti-realism of European art cinema; the topography of the desert Western and the rural road movie; and to the new wave of electronic music and atonal chords that is so effectively used to eerily score the film and its often ferocious feral sound effects. The ants enunciate like a ravenous and telepathic army on the relentless march to herald in the Armageddon, while the bleeps, squeaks, hums and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> that also saturate the soundscape creates the impression that invisible forces haunt every space. These are not ants that can be trampled upon or squished between ones fingers but super centurions of the insect world. The film’s cinematography is composed of two distinct styles. Firstly, there are the intimate and naturalistic close ups of the ants, their colonies, machinery, computers, the sun and the moon, obelisques, and the various textures - such as skin, electrical wires, yellow poison - that colour and wash the entire mise-en-scène. One feels as if one is in the laboratory or desert with the ants, and in that transferable relationship between film and viewer, as one watches one scratches skin and hair as if their phantom legs are beginning to crawl over and burrow down deep into you. This is carnal science fiction cinema. The wildlife photographer Ken Middleham shot the insect sequences for Phase IV, as he also did for the documentary The Hellstrom Chronicle. Through a microscopic lens, the anatomy of an ant has never been so diabolically well chronicled. Phase IV is also composed of long shots, frames of deep focus and wide panoramas, so that the shimmering heat of the desert and the liquid fire of the sun appear enormous and awesome in their power. The film is full of sublime cinematography. It simply takes one’s breath away and makes one feel like a tiny dot, like a single ant, in a giant universe. This oscillation between near and far, between claustrophobia and agoraphobia, positions Earth in a never ending and expanding cosmos, but also under a forensic microscope where all our activities are being closely monitored. Ultimately this is a film caught in a paranoid state of delusion and allusion, as the troubles of America seep its way into its metaphoric visual and aural palettes. Signs of the times Narratively, Phase IV speaks to a number of critical concerns of America at the time the film was made: ecological and environmental collapse; the Cold War, and the Vietnam war; the ambivalent relationship that society has to science and their hyper-rationalist scientists; and to the irrational fear of miscegenation. Velvet ant stinger tip scanning electron microscope Janice Carr/Wikimedia, CC BY Phase I: Ecological and Environmental Apocalypse One of the concerns of Phase IV is the relentless expansion of the suburbs, population growth, unsustainability and the mechanisation of farming. The film’s first land-based shots are of new town billboards and half completed homes. The yellow poison used to destroy the ant colony is a coda for industrial fertilisation and the dangers it brings to agriculture. The ants, which wipe out species that are above them in the food chain, are the avatars that put the ecology of Earth out of balance and as a consequence threaten the survival of all species, of the planet itself. However, we realise late in the film that they are actually custodians of the future – it is we who must be stopped or over-taken in the evolutionary chain if Earth is to prosper. Phase II: Red Ants under the Bed Phase IV was made at a time when the Cold War and Vietnam was uppermost in the American nation’s psyche. The ants in the film become both the fifth column, and the personification of Soviet norms – working collectively for the greater good and without individuality or individualism, always willing to sacrifice so long as the cohering centre is maintained. The ant army can also be likened to the Viet Cong or the National Liberation Front, fighting against the superior technology and firepower of the American military. The ants build a series of connecting tunnels and traps, infiltrate the compound, and in consort with the “natural” environment turn the desert and sun on the scientists. The scientists, secured in their hi-tech fortress compound, use yellow poison (agent orange, napalm) to kill the ants, but the ants only grow stronger. Eventually, the scientists have to abandon their laboratory and the ants begin to secure their victory as their centurions march on its grounds. Phase III: Mad Science Phase IV offers up an ambivalent representation of science. Hubbs is the archetypal mad scientist, one who seeks truth in rational method and through reason alone, but is solely intent on destroying the ants at whatever cost. He uses science in a destructive way and is impervious to the human death that occurs around him. The film is a warning about letting too much science into the world. Ant. Sancho McCann/Flickr, CC BY By contrast, Lesko is the humanist scientist. Through his mathematical formulations he seeks to communicate with the ants, to understand them better. Lesko cares about human and ant life and looks to reason and emotion to bridge the species gap. However, the film suggests that Hubb’s approach maybe the one that needs to be followed, offering the viewer a powerful Cold War message about weapons proliferation and the need for aggressive responses. Phase IV: Inter-Species coupling Phase IV has a fear of borders being breached and is full of images of thresholds being overtaken, overrun. The film offers us images of “white flight” in which the ants become marauding rioters intent on taking over the “neighbourhood”. There is one scene of a house being “looted”, flames licking its grounds. The film’s context can be set in the context of the race riots and civil rights abuses that dominated the period. Nonetheless, Phase IV brings the two species together, ant and human, suggesting that in their communion a new dawn will be reached, a new age will be born. In the newly restored cut of the film, this future horizon is a psychedelic trip where a new inter-species reaches the astral plane.

                                The Royal Society of London, the world's oldest scientific publisher, has unveiled a proposal to create the first serious framework for future geoengineering experiments.  It's a sign that what are still considered drastic and risky measures to combat climate change, like artificially injecting tiny particles into the Earth's atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space, are drifting further into the purview of mainstream science. The august scientific body has issued a call to create "an open and transparent review process that ensures such experiments have the necessary social license to operate."  Professor Steve Rayner, the co-director of the Oxford Geoengineering Programme, released what's been christened the 'Berlin Declaration', at the world's first major climate engineering conference currently underway in Germany. Rayner issued a call for amendments from the conference's attendees, which includes top climate scientists, policymakers, and geoengineering scholars.  The draft, in its current iteration, states that "New technologies have the potential to provide significant benefits to society, but they can also be controversial. Indeed the controversies surrounding new technologies have often led to a backlash against their development, as has been seen in the fields of genetically modified organisms and nuclear power." You can read the full draft here—it was distributed at the Climate Engineering Conference in Berlin, where I'll be reporting from all week. It's specifically focused on a subset of geoengineering projects called solar radiation management, which also includes proposals to brighten clouds over the ocean and to send tiny mirrors into orbit to deflect sunlight. The grander geoengineering projects, which fall into this category, have inspired comparisons to schemes befitting Dr. Evil.  "The emergence of interest in climate geoengineering, broadly defined as the deliberate large-scale manipulation of the planetary environment to counteract climate change, has provoked controversy about the practicality and wisdom of such ideas," the document reads.  In an interview, Rayner told me that the document was inspired in part by a failure of Britain's previous foray into climate engineering experimentation, the SPICE (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering) project. That undertaking would have floated a weather balloon a kilometer into the sky to spray 40 gallons of water into the atmosphere, in an attempt to simulate the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions. Graphic: SPICE The impact of the experiment would have been negligible on the climate, but it caused a public outcry, and was eventually cancelled for unrelated reasons. Rayner says scientists interested in studying geoengineering need to learn from the debacle, and to make sure future experiments are carefully and responsibly vetted, both scientifically and publicly. "We need to be very careful in these initial steps," he told me, in order to create "a pragmatic pathway" to climate engineering experiments. He notes that the vast majority of the geoengineering experiments currently under consideration are so small in scale they "couldn't conceivably have any effect on the atmosphere," but that scientists need to consider the "social and political consequences." He said that he and his colleagues did harbor concerns that they were making things "thinkable that ought to be unthinkable" but that with or without a framework, scientists were going to experiment with climate engineering, and it was best to do so in a measured way that kept the public informed. Dr. Ken Caldeira, a prominent American atmospheric scientist also attending the conference, worries that such a document will ultimately prove stifling to climate science. It's too broadly defined, he says, and could end up preventing research that's only tangentially related to geoengineering, if future regulators object to it. "There's a real possibility that this governance, or regulations, could hurt climate science," he said. Regulators could, for instance, not consider carbon sequestration (the act of pumping pollution underground) to be geoengineering, but decide that painting roofs white (another, less controversial geoengineering proposal) is. "How do you define 'experimental work on such techniques'?" Caldeira told me, referring to a line in the text that appears to be vague. "I think it will end up doing more harm than good."  The proposal has already caused heated debate amongst the scientists and commentators in Berlin, and whether it is accepted and published remains to be seen. But Rayner believes that, at least as a subject for discussion and experimentation, geoengineering is here to stay. "A decade ago, '<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nanotech">nanotech</a></span>nology' was a word that was on everybody's lips," he said in a panel discussion. Now we mostly talk about the specific applications of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nanotech">nanotech</a></span>, because it's become so commonplace. Rayner believes the same will happen with geoengineering—it will become normalized. "My prediction is that the word 'geoengineering' will fall out of use, and be replaced by discussion of more specific technologies."

                                Zmapp drugs arriving in Liberia.Ahmed Jallanzo/EPA The news that at least 20 patients suspected to have <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> had fled a clinic in Monrovia, Liberia, after a recent protest shows just how volatile trust can be between local populations and medical staff and officials trying to contain the virus. Any debate over experimental drug use in West Africa is as much tied to this issue as it is to whether deploying them will do anything to stem the outbreak. Some echoes with early <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> pandemic Since it was discovered 40 years ago, research into <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus has led to several experimental drug therapies that could be used to treat infection or as a vaccine. It’s not clear whether the Zmapp drug given to two US doctors and a priest infected with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> affected the outcome of infection (both doctors survived, the priest died) but with unsuccessful efforts to bring its spread under control and more than a thousand people already known to have died in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and a smaller group in Nigeria, the pressure to deploy them is huge. Drugs and vaccines are termed experimental for a reason – they have not gone through the normal rigorous testing that is required before a new drug is licensed for use in humans. There’s no objective proof that they are effective, and they may even be harmful, but in extreme situations their deployment may be perfectly justified. Using drugs in extraordinary circumstances in this way isn’t new – it happened with antiretroviral drugs during the early years of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> global pandemic. When <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> first appeared, it had 100% fatality rate. However, the fatality rate of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is lower (around 60%) and in the case of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, the drugs had been through significant clinical testing – they were just made available more rapidly than usual. With <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, the drugs and treatments being proffered have had only limited testing or no testing in humans at all. Experimental environment This raises many difficult ethical, scientific and societal questions. While clinical trials are designed to carefully manage risk and include controls, using experimental drugs against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> won’t have the same luxury. With dangerous viruses such as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, there is also the significant matter of how, practically, to achieve the same efficacy that full licensing of a drug would require in trials. People cannot be deliberately given <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in order to try out a drug or vaccine, and we will never know in advance where or when the next outbreak will occur that would create a natural environment for a trial. Perhaps the best hope is that an experimental treatment shows sufficient promise when deployed in the current outbreak to warrant a government or international organisation funding its small-scale manufacture and stockpiling for use next time <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> appears. Managing expectations Any measures to restrict the spread of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus need good health infrastructure, trained staff and a system that can deliver a unified response across affected areas if they are to work. Isolating patients, contact follow-ups, breaking the chain of transmission and quarantine, have little to do with science or medicine and far more to do with practicalities on the ground. Deploying experimental medicine happens within this context, and it carries specific risks that go beyond efficacy. Communicating what is happening and why to individuals and whole communities is vital. The World Health Organisation has already attempted to manage expectations after a recent decision that it was ethical to extend the use of experimental drugs for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>: Recent intense media coverage of experimental medicines and vaccines is creating some unrealistic expectations, especially in an emotional climate of intense fear … The public needs to understand that these medical products are under investigation. They have not yet been tested in humans and are not approved by regulatory authorities, beyond use for compassionate care … For most, administration is difficult and demanding. Safe administration of some requires facilities for intensive care, which are rare in West Africa. Adverse reactions to treatments can’t be predicted but they regularly happen. And the potential consequences of adverse reactions and/or failure of the drugs to assist may have additional consequences. As well as potential physical damage to patients, a vital but tenuous faith in the medical staff working to control the outbreak could be undermined in West Africa. The protest in Monrovia shows just how precarious trust is. It might also be undermined if treated patients don’t appear to benefit, even if they are not adversely affected, increasing people’s reluctance to bring infected friends and relatives to medical centres for treatment. The expected outcomes from using experimental drugs will need to be carefully managed. The number of available doses is very small so however they are deployed, they wouldn’t do much to contain the outbreak. In terms of evidence of efficacy, it also raises the question about whether the number of treatments could ever be sufficient to make any acceptable estimate of how well a drug has worked. When it comes to any potential vaccines, very limited doses raises the question of how recipients would be chosen, since vaccines have to be given to people who aren’t yet ill. Perhaps the greatest impact on the course of the outbreak would come from protecting those tasked with caring the infected but of course, with many overseas medical staff, this might invite criticism that they were being treated more favourably. Alongside all this it’s important to carry on with more traditional clinical trials. Criticism of big pharma for not producing an effective remedy for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> over the past 40 years has been overly simplistic. Taking a new drug or vaccine to market may cost up to US$1 billion. It’s not simply a matter of there being insufficient profit in developing drugs to treat <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> – there would actually be a huge loss. But given this is the longest and largest outbreak yet recorded, let’s hope there is new impetus to push forward in this area.

                                Google's back in the open source game, and in a big way. In a world increasingly bent on opening up innovation outside the company firewall, Google just took a major step forward. In June, Google made cloud headlines when it open sourced its Kubernetes project for managing Linux application containers. (These containers are a sort of software "wrapper" that make it much easier to run a given program on any computer without a lot of laborious customization work.) In effect, Google has offered the open source community an application architecture modeled after its own internal tools—in Greek, Kubernetes means literally “helmsman of a ship.” See also: Docker Promises A Standard Way To Package Apps To Run Virtually Anywhere Craig McLuckie Google isn't just releasing its code into the wild all by its lonesome, either: Microsoft, Red Hat, IBM and the open-source project Docker have also joined in support.  Google’s goal with Kubernetes is to allow developers to build applications and services at Web scale using the same principles that Google uses within its own data centers. Kubernetes is built as a portable framework for managing Linux application containers. It lets customers manage their applications the way that Google manages hyper-scale applications like Search and Gmail. Docker creates great developer experiences when building container based applications, and Kubernetes enables customers to operationalize those Docker applications.  By moving to Kubernetes, customers move away from a having to think about managing their application and instead let a smart system do it for them. Inside Google, this shift has had a tremendous impact on developer productivity. Coders build their applications, then rely on internal systems to run, monitor and scale it for them. Kubernetes lets developers outside of Google work the same way. Why Give The Store Away? I spoke to Craig McLuckie (@cmcluck), a senior product manager at Google, about why Google is open sourcing the secret sauce for its cloud and to learn more about the recent string of industry collaborations around Kubernetes. ReadWrite: One of Google’s biggest assets is its homegrown datacenter technology. Until now, Google has been pretty secretive about how it runs things. What’s changed? Craig McLuckie: We have actually been sharing technologies we built at Google with the open-source community for years—for example, [publications describing technologies such as] MapReduce and BigTable have been quite influential in shaping the world of distributed systems. More recently, we are helping to power the container initiative through projects w've created and contributed, including cgroups, Go, lmctfy, and cadvisor. We continue to share our work with the community because we benefit hugely from open-source software and the community support of our efforts. In addition, we are betting big on our Google Cloud Platform business, and as Urs Hölzle underscored earlier this year, Google has gone “all in” on this opportunity.  One of the ways we differentiate our offering is by being open with our customers and providing insight into the technologies we offer. Beyond that, we want our customers to reap the same benefits that we see internally—and Kubernetes can help them build and manage their applications using a portable, lean, open source system similar to the one we use internally. RW: So why not go it alone? Why have you collaborated with so many others in the industry—including some cloud competitors—on Kubernetes? CM: There are two reasons. The first is that we have been incredibly impressed by the power of the open-source ecosystem. Time and again we have seen open-source projects evolve faster than closed alternatives as they benefit from the diverse perspectives and skillsets of the contributors.  We are already seeing fantastic activity on the Kubernetes GitHub repository driven by multiple members of the community. As an example, Red Hat brings deep experience in hardening open source technology for enterprise use. The second is that our customers demand openness and flexibility. We want to win their trust by offering great infrastructure and services, not by locking them in. Working with the community means that strong alternatives will emerge that let our customers run in a multi-cloud world. That is an important prerequisite for many of them when adopting a new technology. Cooperation With Competitors ReadWrite: And it looks like there are still more announcements coming. You have been working with Mesosphere on Kubernetes since July, and there are more announcements today. What’s new? McLuckie: We’ve been working on a couple of things together. Mesosphere will be making substantive contributions to Kubernetes and adopting it as part of Mesos. Together, with the Kubernetes community, we are working to bring the power of Mesos to applications that rely on Kubernetes orchestrator. And it will of course be available everywhere. See also: How To Make Data Services Scale Like Google While some might jump to the conclusion that Mesos and Kubernetes are competitive solutions, I believe our customers will find them very complementary. We share a common vision for the dynamic management of applications and are working to create a framework that brings sophisticated capabilities to the Kubernetes model for multiple cloud deployments.  It would take the community quite a while to evolve the basic Kubernetes system to the level that Mesos has already achieved in terms of offering things like resource and constraint-driven scheduling, or high availability deployments. Having the ability to ‘drop in’ a richer framework really benefits our mutual customers. The other really nice thing is that by combining Kubernetes and Mesos, users get the best of both worlds. Not just the richness of the Mesos distributed kernel, but a framework that lets you run existing workloads (including some of the very popular <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> frameworks like Spark and Hadoop) on the same shared physical resources as your new Kubernetes managed applications. ReadWrite: So what does this mean for Mesosphere and Google Cloud Platform customers? McLuckie: We are working together to make it simple for customers to benefit from the combination of Kubernetes and Mesos, and deploy their Mesos workloads on Google’s container optimized infrastructure via Google Cloud Platform. For example, developers can visit Mesosphere.io’s website and in just a few clicks have a solution up and running on Google Cloud Platform. Or, if they prefer, they can soon use the Click-to-Deploy feature directly from the Google Cloud Platform Dashboard to get their Mesosphere solution running.  Either path gets customers going quickly, and the union of technologies—Mesosphere and Google Cloud Platform— is quite natural. Can't Contain The Container ReadWrite: If you think containers are the thing of the future, does your investment in Kubernetes mean you're in the public game for the long haul? McLuckie: Yes, absolutely! Google has pivoted to focus a significant portion of its resources in terms of engineering man hours and infrastructure spending to Google Cloud Platform. We think this will be Google’s next big business.  However, this is not going to happen overnight. This opportunity will require significant technical innovation and investment, both things that Google is good at and committed to. ReadWrite: You have seen great community momentum with the initial release of Kubernetes. What’s next? McLuckie: We are starting to see broad adoption of Kubernetes , such as in OpenShift v3 from Red Hat and by Clever.com‘s website, and we are excited about incorporating the learnings from these use cases back into the Kubernetes code base. We’ve published a roadmap for Kubernetes on GitHub, and we invite the community to review and comment on what is needed.  Finally, once we get the Kubernetes API in good shape, we will offer a hosted version of the API on Google Cloud Platform that is more deeply integrated into our infrastructure.  Image courtesy of Shutterstock

Even so, these animals play a crucial role in our ecosystem — and now they are in danger of disappearing. According to Wired, 6.5 million Little Brown Bats lived in the eastern U.S. in 2006, making them the most populous wild mammal species in America at the time. Since then, millions of Little Brown Bats have died, leaving them a "threatened species" in many states. What is killing the bats? Though bat death has often been linked to pesticides and other chemicals, the chief cause seems to be White Nose Syndrome (WNS), a fatal fungal infection with no treatment or cure.

                                It can be used to store energy. At the American Chemical Society's national meeting this week, researchers from the University of Alberta unveiled a way to create extremely efficient batteries called "<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=supercapacitor">supercapacitor</a></span>s" using specially treated hemp, a non-psychoactive variation of the marijuana plant. That means hemp could be a low-cost, renewable raw material that revolutionizes energy storage. How it works: Hemp fibers are heated over the course of 24 hours, causing the material's carbon atoms to align and form nanosheets, each of which are only one carbon atom thick, and which can be used as conductors in batteries. Basic structure of a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=supercapacitor">supercapacitor</a></span>.

Millions of gallons of a cocktail of water, sand and chemicals are injected into the horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale, releasing the gas—and causing violent protests in Europe and parts of America.Geothermal energy, by contrast, has yet to stir much controversy. Most geothermal plants are located where water has seeped down into the Earth’s crust, been heated and forced back up through permeable rock. Drill a well to between 3,000 and 12,000 feet, and the searing water and steam can be released to drive generators.Geothermal is a minnow among power sources. America has the world’s highest installed capacity of geothermal generating plants—3.4 gigawatts’ worth at last count (see first chart)—but they generate only 0.4% of its electricity (see second chart).

                                The news: Civil unrest in response to the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has received the lion's share of media coverage. But as protests continue, the authorities' response has increasingly looked less like police action and more like a crackdown in a war zone. This is partially because American police forces are now equipped to operate in war zones. As U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have gradually come down, military equipment — armored personnel carriers, weapons, tactical uniforms and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> — have become available to virtually every local police force across the country. "The equipment has been added to the armories of police departments that already look and act like military units," wrote the New York Times' Matt Apuzzo. Read More

                                Rice University researchers have developed a new ultralight but tough nanofoam called “GO-0.5BN” from atom-thick sheets. The finding is an update to a previous computer-simulation study of “pillared boron nitride (PBN)” reported in July by KurzweilAI. The Rice team has now actually produced and tested the material.

                                AT FIRST glance it would appear that China has gone online, and gone digital, with great gusto.

That is the conclusion of a report published on July 24th by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), a think-tank run by the eponymous consulting firm.
