                                Shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals are up by 18% in early trading. On Thursday afternoon, management announced that the FDA loosened a hold on the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> treatment in the company's development pipeline. "[T]he U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has verbally confirmed they have modified the full clinical hold placed on the TKM-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to a partial clinical hold," they said. "This action enables the potential use of TKM-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in individuals infected with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus." "Earlier this month, the agency put a hold on a Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp clinical trial of TKM-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, one of the few <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> treatments advanced enough to be tested in people," reported Reuters' Julie Steenhuysen. This had enraged the families of those infected by the deadly virus, which has been killing people across West Africa. "We have been closely watching the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus outbreak and its consequences, and we are willing to assist with any responsible use of TKM-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>," Tekmira CEO Mark Murray said Thursday. "The foresight shown by the FDA removes one potential roadblock to doing so. This current outbreak underscores the critical need for effective therapeutic agents to treat the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. We recognize the heightened urgency of this situation and are carefully evaluating options for use of our investigational drug within accepted clinical and regulatory protocols."

                                KentuckyFC (1144503) writes One curious property of massless particles like photons is that their energy or momentum can take any value across many orders of magnitude, a property that physicists call scale invariance. By contrast, massive particles like electrons always have the same mass regardless of their energy or momentum. So massive particles are not scale invariant. The concept of unparticles is the idea that some "stuff" may have mass, energy and momentum and yet also be scale invariant. This stuff must be profoundly different from ordinary particles, hence the name: unparticles. Nobody has ever seen an unparticle but now physicists are suggesting that unparticles may hold the key to understanding unconventional <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=superconductivity">superconductivity</a></span>. Their thinking is that at very low temperatures, ordinary particles can sometimes behave like unparticles. In other words, their properties become independent of the scale at which they're observed. So if an unparticle moves without resistance on a tiny scale, then it must also move without resistance at every scale, hence the phenomenon of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=superconductivity">superconductivity</a></span>. That could provide some important insights into unconventional <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=superconductivity">superconductivity</a></span> which has puzzled physicists since it was discovered in the 1980s. <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                Chris Pratt is currently dominating the box office, with his "Guardians of the Galaxy" raking in over $126 million since opening last weekend. But Pratt, who used to be 60 pounds heavier, didn't initially see himself in the role of action hero. He explains in the current cover story of Esquire: When 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was pitched to me, I said, 'I don’t think so.' I just didn’t picture myself getting the role. I didn’t want to go and embarrass myself like I did when I auditioned for G.I. Joe a couple of years previously. I went in there, and halfway through I saw the director’s eyes just glaze over. It made sense — I was a little heavy and out of shape. I was not gonna play someone from G.I. Joe. I did not look like a G.I. Joe action figure come to life. Fast forward and Pratt is now a bona fide movie star, with Oscar-winning films like "Zero Dark Thirty" and "Moneyball" under his belt. But getting to "action figure" status took hard work — and it has paid off. "I have more energy. I sleep better. My sex drive is up. Blood's flowing. I'm less susceptible to impulse. I'm in a different mode," the actor says of his current, slimmed down 6-foot-2 frame. Pratt tells Esquire's Anna Peele how he motivated himself to get fit: When I was way out of shape, the idea of using whitening strips on my teeth seemed terrible. I have to do that every day? I'll never do it. What you want is instant results when you're out of shape. You want your teeth whitened in 45 minutes with the use of lasers. But when you're in shape, you know it's the result of doing a little bit every day. Moments aren't just moments. A moment might be a week or a month. So instead of 'Boy, I'd love to eat this hamburger right now,' I'm considering a little further into the future. I'm thinking, 'I eat that hamburger and that's 1,200 calories, and I'm gonna work out tomorrow and burn 800 calories. I may as well eat a salad here, still do that workout, and then I'm actually making progress.' Pratt says he had to sacrifice: "You can't have hash browns, or burgers, or anything fried. You can't have <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carbs">carbs</a></span>. You have to work out five times a week."  But in the end, it has all been worth it to finally obtain his "action figure" physique: "I can do 40-inch box jumps now. Action-hero physical stuff. Jumping that high feels really good ... When you get in shape, the world around you becomes things you want to jump on and climb on."

                                What if virtual reality didn't require a headset? What if the user, sitting in something like a sense deprivation space minus all the saltwater, could build multiple realities with nothing but their own imagination and the help of some improvisational narrative guides?  This is what the troupe of narrators behind ROOM, an interactive storytelling experience, are doing at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival.  Over the course of 25 days in August, the troupe will lead 250 blindfolded "players" into a room, where with a combination of sound design and their voices they will construct a vast number of alternate realities. Think of it as 25 minutes of virtual reality without a headset.  One of the game's narrators, writer and director Alan Fielden, said the first version of ROOM was meticulously planned. But, its current iteration, which is more free form, bears little resemblance to its original incarnation. "The scenario was always the same: a room you had to escape from," Fielden said. "We had descriptions of every object in the room written on real paper. We'd tried to anticipate every possibility, and it was mad and noisy. The first evolution involved replacing planning with improvisation. That was the true beginning." Room Portrait #1 with Ross Sutherland at the Southbank Centre Library. Image: ROOM This was the iteration of ROOM  I recently experienced at the Pleasance Theatre in London. A "game" of infinite virtual possibility. For me, it was as if the phosphenes dancing on the back of my eyelids were the quantum particles and waves of light thrown out onto the cinema screen of my mind. There was a thrill to it all, but also some trepidation, as if the narrators might not be up to the task. But, they were. Building my virtual realities out of a piece of experimental science fiction I'd just begun writing, the narrators sent me hurtling into vast stretches of time and space. All of it by turns intricately and absurdly crafted. It was the first time the troupe experimented with an existing text. And it came as a total surprise to me and two of ROOM's narrators, who had to adjust to this curveball on the fly.  My ROOM experience started, not unlike a doctor's visit, the moment a narrator invited me inside. Once in their domain, I was handed a blindfold. After placing it around my head, the narrator led me by hand through a doorway, up a set of stairs, through another doorway and finally into a space whose dimensions I could not imagine. I then was directed to sit down on a chair.  "Welcome to ROOM," I heard. "ROOM is a game. It's a story that we tell together. There are just a few things that we ask of you. One is that you remain blindfolded. Two is that you remain seated throughout." "Now the way that it works is that we will begin by describing a scenario, and from there you can jump in at any point you like. There are no right or wrong ways of playing. The more adventurous you are, the more adventurous we will be." "Are you ready?" I was asked. "Yes," I said. Cue rhythmic ambient electronic music. A voice, another narrator, came out of the void speaking the words from my text. The short story follows a disembodied entity as it travels through data, time, and space. The game opened with the first part of the text. Set against the rhythmic ambient electronic music, it came vividly to life. In ROOM, the story underwent mutation and filtration via three different narrators and me, the player, who quickly fell into a meditative state produced by the game's visual and spatial sense deprivation.  In the narration, I'd performed some experiment that made me pure data. To whom I was sending transmissions, I do not know. Now: twenty-four miles from Earth. Was it some hot air balloon come untethered in a dream? Or my consciousness breaking the confines of my skull? This body: disintegrated, reformed in a stream of luminous data now visible from the arc between air and void. A new topography laying its lattices down upon the world, where once only planes, ships and trains traced their patterns. Now: weightless, invisible matrices bury the ancients who lie in repose.  Entombed on this rock, this ship, I can see their ghosts alive in the machines. And Ive weaved myself through their chrysalises, avatars of old, softened by the crush of gravity. And, yes, Ive electrified the recently perished. Replayed their dreams. A rewind here, a fast-forward there. Hung on the final pause before they slipped. All at once, no blurring of the images, the sounds, the sensations. The circuit boards of life. They, too, have their memories. In my fiction, the narrating entity can travel anywhere. Its description of events and such should be understood as completely non-linear. And, for all intents and purposes, there isn't a story. Not as such. But the ROOM crew fashioned a branching set of narratives out of it. A fluid and epic series of virtual realities. "The experiment was a success," I heard someone say, the narrator of my own consciousness. "I'm losing proof of it. The lines are blurred now. I look up at the sky and send transmissions. I've become the data. I am the data: swirling, moving, surrounding, taking me beyond the net to other worlds." I would later flash back to this moment when Fieldan described ROOM as variously "real virtual reality" (or "real reality"), a "brain bath," an "imagination workout," a "dream jam," or "lucid scheming."  The ROOM experience doesn't require drugs or dioramas to simulate realities. There is the sensation of bathing in a type of strange collective dream. A good analogue would be the Philip K. Dick novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, in which Mars colonists use Perky Pat Layouts (scaled models) and the psychedelic drug CAN-D to achieve a simulated and shared alternate or virtual reality. The big difference is that the ROOM experience doesn't require drugs or dioramas to simulate realities. Multiple sets of imaginations do the heavy lifting, and all quite effortlessly.  The narrators' task is "to figure out, ideally in the space of the first five minutes, if the player is visual-minded, or sonically minded, a feeler or a thinker, into details or the bigger picture, surreal or naturalistic, interested in socializing or being solitary, etc," Fieldan explained. Those first few moments are critical, and my experience was no different. Though I hadn't imagined a spaceship in my story, in ROOM some sort of interstellar vessel serves as my base, and it really pulled me into this shared reality. The ship served as a place to take on various physical forms, but also became another room where this disembodied entity of pure data had to return. As a means of pushing me from one narrative to the next, I have an energy pack, which has to be re-charged at intervals. And so this boundless entity was, as in the early iterations of ROOM, trapped in a room. Entering this virtual world, the influence of cinema was immediate and profound. Sophie Grodin, a London-based performance artist, would later confirm cinema's outsized influence on ROOM. Perhaps this has something to do with the cinematic programming that we all absorb from a young age. A visual language that predominates, and one that we cannot easily discard.  At any rate, from here on out, the narrators and I could zoom in, focus on objects, see any object from multiple perspectives, flash forward, put things into slow-motion, and time travel. Though I could rewind the story, it was a power that I for whatever reason chose not to exploit.   ROOM player at Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2014. Image: ROOM In my story, the narrator, as in Maldoror, is a shape-shifter. In ROOM, this shape-shifting is accomplished with the help of some advanced technology involving crystals that constantly explode and reform in various configurations. After taking some sort of form and charging my energy pack, I descend to the Earth and walk on its surface. There are birds and trees, all fake. I see Earth as a barren wasteland. I send my consciousness upward in a burst of crystals that have become like a near limitless set of eyes. As the crystal shards hang in the air, I ask to be jettisoned to the end of the universe. To the singularity.  You've reached the singularity, what would you like to do now? The troupe oblige. They send me hurtling toward the singularity, which appeared as a wall that I hit Looney Tunes-style and slid down. A female voice said, in a moment that wouldn't have been out of place in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe, "You've reached the singularity, what would you like to do now?" "I want to be crushed and come out the other side," I said.  "Very well," the voice said.  The wall crashed down on me. Once again I found myself disintegrated before being squeezed out the other side in the womb of a newly formed universe. In my mind, it seemed rather like one universe was shitting out another universe through a digestive black hole. The visual made me chuckle. But, despite the comedy of it, it was incredibly vivid. "You loop around the top and see the universe from all angles," the voice said. "You see planets and stars that are billions of lights years apart, and you come together and disperse again in every shape imaginable. You <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ripple">ripple</a></span> like a wave upon the planes of existence. You see stars exploding, giving birth. The sun becomes a woman in labor. She gives birth to planets. Hospital beds, machinery, blood, fire." (All of this, by the way, is being soundtracked by epic, M83-style ambient <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> music.) "You form into one big crystal and you start to fall down toward a green and blue planet," the voice continued. "And you fall and fall through several different atmospheres, through clouds, through gas, through blue skies, through tree tops, down, and you land, and you look around you, and there are children staring at you." What's interesting about this bit, apart from the children staring Aphex Twin-style at me for no reason, is that the sensation of falling was convincing. Sure, in reality, I was sat on a chair like a working stiff, but I'd lost contact with my physical body. In place of it, a virtual body reigned. An invisible simulacra had, in that moment of falling down, taken its place, and it had some weight to it. As I felt this new body, I intuited that the gravity on this planet must be different, so my body felt lighter as it fell through the sky. "What would you like to do now?" I was asked. I asked to go down into this new Earth's core and see if there was a civilization down below. And so I drilled myself into the bottom of the planet, and encounter an overwhelmingly bright light: a sun inside the planet. My face sweats and the skin starts to peel back.  At this point, another narrator suggested that some part of me is missing. Not anything essential or integral. A heat shield. I activated it. I watched the elements of the hollow planet churning before flying around the micro sun. I'm told that all of it is too abstract, and indeed I cannot make sense of what his happening. But, the narrators' words provide the images for what must be a mind experiencing fragmentation.  I see dinosaurs, Romans, Greeks, a woman holding a baby, Alpha Centauri, a teacher standing at a chalkboard, children playing, London, grass, a dog chasing a ball, shadows, a milkshake, a man jumping in front of a train, children, Africa, a post office queue, love, cheeseburgers, Coca-Cola, concrete, and fights. Just words, of course. But, as they invade your consciousness like William S. Burrough's idea of "word virus," flickering bursts of light depicting the scenes puncture the void of your mind. The words are producing images that become your reality. I then chose to come out of the Earth's core and transform into a sperm whale. This scene began when a cord dropped down in front of me. I grabbed it and was pulled up into the clouds. I dangled over a vast navy blue ocean. I let go of the cord and burst into a "billion crystals," then crashed into the ocean, where I was gradually reassembled into a sperm whale.  "It's as if you're whole body is a giant bus," a narrator said, while another makes the noise of a whale, as Orozco cued oceanic sounds. The whale calls, improvised by Jeffries and Stapleton-Crittenden, temporarily brought me out of the experience. I wanted to laugh. Not because they couldn't approximate the calls, but because they'd tried with more than a little bit of cheekiness. A reminder that this is, after all, just a game.  ROOM player flanked by narrators Annabelle Stapleton-Crittenden (left) and Malachy Orozco (right) at Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Image: ROOM Once more I found myself aboard the space ship, where pixels swirled in various formations on a screen. Eventually these pixels spelled out, "Thank you for playing ROOM," which each of the narrators utter as I removed my blindfold, whereupon I found the three of them staring at me in a completely ordinary room. And by ordinary I mean that it was a boring come-down to the past 25 minutes of collective hallucinatory storytelling and world-building.  In that moment, I was also curious about how the narrators felt after the blindfold came off. Feeling a bit discombobulated, like I was coming out of a dream in slow-motion, I forgot to ask them. I later posed the question to the group, and Grodin responded with a sense of amazement. "I can't even count the number of amount of times when you just sit back, and look at this person in wonder," Grodin said. "And the amount of times where the player takes off their blindfold and are in awe of what they just did are also many." "Many people dont think that they have it in them or that they have a good imagination," she added. "They think it has somehow disappeared, and the moment they open their mouths for the first time they completely surprise themselves. That is wonderful." I never doubted my imagination, but I can say that I experienced something breathtaking and very original. Emerging from ROOM was a bit like coming out of some strange, verbal virus-induced amniotic fluid. A cosmic rebirth of sorts. Psychedelic even. A very virtual reality indeed.

"And the amount of times where the player takes off their blindfold and are in awe of what they just did are also many." "Many people dont think that they have it in them or that they have a good imagination," she added. "They think it has somehow disappeared, and the moment they open their mouths for the first time they completely surprise themselves. That is wonderful." I never doubted my imagination, but I can say that I experienced something breathtaking and very original. Emerging from ROOM was a bit like coming out of some strange, verbal virus-induced amniotic fluid. A cosmic rebirth of sorts. Psychedelic even. A very virtual reality indeed.

                                Rice University researchers have developed a new ultralight but tough nanofoam called “GO-0.5BN” from atom-thick sheets. The finding is an update to a previous computer-simulation study of “pillared boron nitride (PBN)” reported in July by KurzweilAI. The Rice team has now actually produced and tested the material.

                                A new approach to dating the birth of our solar system could help find other similar systems.Flickr/Dmitry Boyarin, CC BY Without the sun, there would be no Earth – but amazingly, we don’t know the finer details about the prenatal history of our sun, where it was born and if other stars in our galaxy share a similar history. In a study published today in Science, we add a couple of pieces to the solar jigsaw and show that two stellar events – a supernova or neutron star merger, plus a dying giant – flung heavy elements into the nursery in which our sun was born, roughly 100 million and 30 million years before the sun’s formation. Research in the prehistory of the sun helps us compare the circumstances of the birth of the sun with those of other stars in our galaxy, setting the existence of the sun, the Earth and humans more firmly within the broader context of the billions of stars and planets (and possibly other lifeforms) that exist in the Milky Way. It’s a matter of time Recent historical events have been recorded by the writings of historians. Going back further in time, though, we have to rely on other methods to date events. One of the main tools to achieve this is radioactivity. Radioactive nuclei, by definition, decay as time passes by emitting energetic particles that can be very dangerous to living organisms. The rate at which they decay is defined by their half-life, which is the time it takes for half of the original nuclei to disappear. A famous example is carbon-14, which has a half-life of 5,730 years. If the recovered bones of a human contain roughly half the amount of carbon-14 present in the biosphere, that individual must have died 5,730 years ago. We know the age of the Earth from radioactive dating. Flickr/NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, CC BY Radioactivity has also allowed us to date the age of the Earth at 4.54 billion years and, via analysis of extra-terrestrial rock samples carried to us via meteoritic falls or space missions, to derive a detailed timing of the events that led to the formation of planets in the solar system. Using the same techniques, we can also learn something about the major events in the prehistory of the matter in the solar system, such as the period prior to the formation of the sun. Ingredients for a solar system Elements in our solar system, except for hydrogen and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helium">helium</a></span> (which were created in the Big Bang), were produced by nuclear reactions in stars. The material that makes up the solar system was slowly added to by hundreds to thousands of stars as they exploded into supernovas, a process we call “stellar addition”. At some point, this heavier material became isolated inside a star-forming region of the galaxy, where the gas was cooler and denser than the usual galactic gas. Within this stellar nursery, gas collapsed to form a number of stars, including our sun. By timing the life span of this stellar nursery we can start deducing how massive it was and how many stars were born alongside our sun. How to make a solar system. To be able to time the interval that elapsed between the last of the stellar additions and the formation of the sun, we needed to know the how much radioactive nuclei was present at the time of the two events. Meteoritic analysis provides us these abundances at the formation of the sun. But the abundances in the final stellar addition - and the beginning of the stellar nursery – can only be predicted theoretically by models of nuclear processes in stars, which aren’t well understood. A long-standing, frustrating problem has been related to the abundances of the radioactive nuclei iodine-129 and hafnium-182. Until today, these two nuclei were believed to be produced by the same stellar event, such as a supernova or a neutron star merger, in a process that produces heavy elements including gold and lead. Trying to date this last stellar addition, though, produced two completely inconsistent timings: roughly 45 or 90 million years using hafnium-182 or iodine-129, respectively. The main result of our study published today is that these two nuclei were instead produced by two different types of events: iodine-129 was still produced with gold by a supernova or a neutron star merger, but hafnium-182 was instead produced with lead by a dying giant star. The stellar addition from this last giant star happened at most 30 million years before the formation of the sun. This dating provides us with an upper limit for the life span of the stellar nursery where the sun was born, which will allow us to know more intimately the parent stellar nursery of our sun – and the sun’s “siblings” which may harbour solar systems similar to ours.

                                Right now, Hawaii is getting hit by Iselle, the first hurricane to hit the island chain since 1992. Statistically speaking, you're probably not there to watch it all go down, but this storm-faring robot is, and it's live tweeting the whole thing.  Wave Glider Holoholo, a "wave glider" robot that's powered by the waves themselves (and solar panels, too) is equipped with an internet connection (and, apparently, a Twitter account), and sensors that measure water temperature, wind speed, water pressure, wind direction, and it's got a camera on it, to boot. For the last eight hours or so, it's been periodically tweeting out pictures, talking about the wind conditions (at last check: strong breeze. Earlier, a "fresh breeze." Before that, "near gale"), and generally being a cool seafaring autonomous robo weatherman. Enjoy the view! pic.twitter.com/zFFoBOu9RY — Wave Glider Holoholo (@Holoholo_WG) August 7, 2014 The use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> in hurricanes is, by this point, commonplace: NASA and NOAA have whole fleets of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> designed specifically to fly through hurricanes to learn more about them. But <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> actually in the water itself are more rare. Usually, the wave glider is used to monitor sharks, but with the hurricane coming through, it's being used to monitor the weather. The company, Liquid Robotics, says that it should be able to withstand the storm. With the worst of the storm coming tonight, we'll see if that's true. It'll either live tweet its destruction, or it'll still be around in the morning, offering up 140-character updates.

                                Right now, Hawaii is getting hit by Iselle, the first hurricane to hit the island chain since 1992. Statistically speaking, you're probably not there to watch it all go down, but this storm-faring robot is, and it's live tweeting the whole thing.  Wave Glider Holoholo, a "wave glider" robot that's powered by the waves themselves (and solar panels, too) is equipped with an internet connection (and, apparently, a Twitter account), and sensors that measure water temperature, wind speed, water pressure, wind direction, and it's got a camera on it, to boot. For the last eight hours or so, it's been periodically tweeting out pictures, talking about the wind conditions (at last check: strong breeze. Earlier, a "fresh breeze." Before that, "near gale"), and generally being a cool seafaring autonomous robo weatherman. Enjoy the view! pic.twitter.com/zFFoBOu9RY — Wave Glider Holoholo (@Holoholo_WG) August 7, 2014 The use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> in hurricanes is, by this point, commonplace: NASA and NOAA have whole fleets of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> designed specifically to fly through hurricanes to learn more about them. But <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> actually in the water itself are more rare. Usually, the wave glider is used to monitor sharks, but with the hurricane coming through, it's being used to monitor the weather. The company, Liquid Robotics, says that it should be able to withstand the storm. With the worst of the storm coming tonight, we'll see if that's true. It'll either live tweet its destruction, or it'll still be around in the morning, offering up 140-character updates.

                                The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told lawmakers on Thursday he has activated the agency's emergency operation center at the highest response level to fight the worst <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in history. Dr Thomas Frieden testified at an emergency hearing that the CDC has more than 200 staff members in Atlanta working on the outbreak, and will soon have more than 50 disease experts in West Africa. Frieden said he was "confident there will not be a large <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in the United States." However, he said it was possible that people who have traveled to West Africa might bring the virus back home with them, and even spread it to some healthcare workers and family members. The two are now being cared for at Emory University in Georgia.

                                From Quartz comes the story of a Silicon Valley start-up trying to kickstart a delivery system using package-laden <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s to overfly gridlocked traffic — in Bhutan. Bhutanese roads are slow, the weather can be brutal, and there are very few physicians to go around. That’s why, earlier this year, the Bhutanese government and the World Health Organization reached out to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Matternet">Matternet</a></span>, a Palo Alto company backed by some big name American investors that develops transportation networks using unmanned aerial vehicles to reach hard-to-access places. ... The project in Bhutan, however, is the first big test for the startup. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Matternet">Matternet</a></span> is aiming to build a network of low-cost quadcopters to connect the country’s main hospitals with rural communities. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Matternet">Matternet</a></span> uses small quadcopters that can carry loads of about four pounds across 20 km at a time, to and from pre-designated landing stations. The company is able to track these flights in real-time, and aims to eventually deploy fully-automated landing stations that replace <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> batteries, giving them extended range and flight time. The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s it uses typically cost between $2,000-5,000. <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                A team of European researchers have discovered distinct differences in the dialects of the Spanish language by studying it through 140-character bursts. In the study Crowdsourcing Dialect Characterization through Twitter, Bruno Gonçalves from Toulon University in France and David Sánchez from the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems in Spain, studied 50 million geo-located Spanish tweets over the course of three years. They discovered that, as expected, most came from Spain, Spanish America, and across the U.S., as first reported by the MIT Technology Review. To take a closer look at how words and language vary across geographic locations, the team studied how Spanish words for the same object can vary based on where people tweet from—for instance, the word for “car” can be auto, carro, coche, concho, or movi. The researchers discovered that some expressions are clustered in different regions, demonstrating different geographic dialects. “Up until now researchers had been limited to small scale surveys and in-person interviews with the obvious limitations in terms of number of individuals considered and the associated costs of travel,” Bruno Gonçalves said in an email interview with ReadWrite. “With Twitter and the advent of cheap GPS-enabled smartphones, we can study how language is used by millions of users scattered across the world in their day to day communications.” Thanks to the huge quantity of data, Gonçalves and Sánchez discovered that the Spanish language is split between two “superdialects,” a form of language that includes two or more dialects. One Spanish superdialect that’s spoken in large American and Spanish cities, and one that’s common among rural parts of Spanish-speaking countries. “It was relatively well known that some expressions were more localized than others, and we were hoping to be able to see that in the data,” Gonçalves said. “The urban/rural difference had not been observed before as traditionally dialect researchers have focused less on city dwellers.” While this study is the first to discover such superdialects by analyzing tweets, it’s not the first time linguists have turned to the social network to figure out how people talk. Scientists have used Twitter to figure out how slang words and phrases like “bro” and “AF” originated in different geographic areas, and to study the evolution of languages, like Welsh, in real-time. “This is also a good example of the potential benefits of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> for the study of human behavior,” Gonçalves said. “Data that was generated by users when they used the Twitter platform to communicate with their followers and friends allowed us to study how a specific language is used ‘in the wild’.” Through similar research, scientists could discover “superdialects” in other languages.

                                To most people, the idea of cryptographic currency is essentially synonymous with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. But <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is just one of hundreds of competing mathematical currencies available through online exchanges. As this spread of community-focused and oftentimes esoteric <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> continues exploding, what's it take to survive? Some cryptocurrencies are marketed to particular groups. Theres HamRadioCoin for amateur broadcasters, TacoCoin for taco lovers everywhere, and JuggaloCoin for fans of none other than the Insane Clown Posse. There are digital coins modeled after rival currencies from Star Treks United Federation of Planets and Klingon empire. Theres even a currency called BumbaCoin thats automatically distributed to Internet trolls who post Jamaican vulgarities in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> forums. But even <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> creators say successfully launching a new alternative currency, or "altcoin," is far from trivial and requires careful attention to state-of-the-art math and computer science, economics, and old-fashioned marketing and community building. With so much competition, coins that dont quickly grab and hold on to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> markets attention and earn users trust can easily drop in value and find themselves vanishing from online exchanges. Almost all the altcoins these days have been created with little or no consideration for the three aspects described above, Larry Ren, the lead developer on ReddCoin, which aims to make it easier to send money through existing social networking sites, told me. There is little surprise that the average shelf life of an altcoin is a couple of months or even weeks. To tap into an existing community base, some other coins are tied to specific real-world geographical locations. Theres a NewYorkCoin, a VegasCoin (naturally), and an ItalyCoin. Irish <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> fans can choose between EireCoin, Gaelcoin, and IrishCoin, which of course has already been used to buy a pint of Guinness in a Dublin pub. Boosters of the geographical currencies say they can be used in giveaways to spur tourists to spend more money and can help keeps funds in local economies, similar to paper community currencies already in use in some towns and cities. The same impulse seems to motivate members of other types of communities, like the creators of JuggaloCoin. The most important thing to understand about Juggalo culture is that it is all about Family and helping each other out, says the JuggaloCoin site. By spending Juggalo Coins, Juggalos can be certain that their money is going to someone who is down with the clown. JuggaloCoin logo.

Las Vegas is a sunny place for shady people and there are all sorts of transactions that visitors to the city of sin dont want seen by snooping spouses, corporate accountants, or the NSA. Other coins are aimed at other types of markets where traditional payment systems arent available, or buyers and sellers want extra anonymity. For instance, firearms enthusiasts, tired of being blacklisted by PayPal and other payment providers, can transact business in Guncoin. Guncoins anonymous project manager told me in an email that many involved with firearms were distrustful of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, and are more likely to accept a coin created by and for gun enthusiasts. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas—unless its on your credit card statement. Most people we have talked to really have no idea what <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> or <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> even is, and few are interested in learning more, Guncoin's manager wrote. The industry really needed a firearms-specific crypto to get their attention.  Similarly, cannabis traders, who also experience problems dealing with the banking system, can choose between HempCoin, PotCoin, Cannacoin, and CannabisCoin. Porn purveyors can offer customers a credit card alternative with GroinCoin, TitCoin, or WankCoin. Really. People who want to buy adult material or tip cam models are often reluctant in doing so for fear of being caught by their significant others when credit card statements roll in, as Greg, a Canadian accountant involved in WankCoins creation, told me over email. And credit card fees are high in the adult industry because of the risk of chargebacks, making merchants willing to seek alternatives, he added. In a WankCoin promotional video modeled after a newscast, a trio of woman scientists—clad only in open lab coats, bras, and panties—force a male captive to masturbate, faster and faster, using his wank energy to power their computers and generate more currency. When he reaches 1.21 jigafaps of pumping power, their 1950s-style computer console ejaculates physical coins like a slot machine, causing one of the buxom scientists to jump up and down with glee. In reality, the mining process by which new WankCoins are created is more prosaic. As with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, WankCoin transactions are published to the network of active users, and coin miners work to place them on the shared public ledger called the blockchain. Each block on that chain is a set of new transaction records, along with various other housekeeping data. When miners add a new block to the chain, theyre automatically rewarded with newly-generated coins, plus transaction fees associated with the transactions logged in the block. "We need more power! You heard her: Keep on pumping!" Not every set of transaction records is a valid block, however—information from a block is run through a cryptographic hashing function, a kind of algorithm that transforms arbitrary strings of data into a fixed-size number. Cryptographic hash functions are designed to make it difficult to predict the functions output or to find a string of data that hashes to a particular value other than by trial and error. Only blocks that hash to a number smaller than a certain threshold are considered valid. This means miners have to try different combinations of transactions and other data until they find an acceptable block. Most coins aim to have new blocks added at a constant rate, and the underlying software will automatically adjust the difficulty of mining by raising and lowering the hash threshold as new blocks are created faster or slower than the target rate. When <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> first launched, it was possible to mine coins with a regular computers CPU. But as the currency grew in popularity and value, miners moved first from the CPU to graphics cards, which were better suited to the rapid-fire arithmetic needed to quickly compute possible hash values, and then to machines with specialized mining chips called ASICs, for application-specific integrated circuits. Partly to make mining practical on ordinary computers again, some currencies deliberately use different hashing algorithms than <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, so machines built to mine <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> dont have the same advantages over ordinary household computers. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Litecoin">Litecoin</a></span>, often said to be second in popularity to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, uses a hashing algorithm called scrypt, as do its many variants, including the Shiba-Inu-meme-inspired <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></span>. And with scrypt-focused ASICs now on the market, other currencies have switched to still more esoteric hashing algorithms, including one formula called X11 that combines the output of 11 different functions into one hash. One currency, called <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=PrimeCoin">PrimeCoin</a></span>, requires that hashes be linked to certain chains of prime numbers of interest to mathematicians, so miners are potentially doing scientifically useful work as they record transactions and generate new coins. Creators of new cryptocurrencies must choose all of the mathematical settings for their coins: the target mining rate, the hashing algorithm, the number of coins given per block to successful miners, and the total number of coins to be created, among others. VegasCoin, for instance, tops out at 100 million total coins, compared to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s 21 million and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Litecoin">Litecoin</a></span>s 84 million. Generating too many coins can mean the currencys not worth enough to motivate miners and investors; generate too few, and the currency can be worth too much and impractical to spend. We tried to be modest with our total number of coins to help ensure a higher value in the future, wrote VegasCoins Yates. Our 30 coin block reward was arrived at by the toss of the dice, gotta love that Vegas style! Yates team picked <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=LiteCoins">LiteCoins</a></span> scrypt-mining algorithm to make the coin more approachable to at-home, amateur miners. Other coins take the opposite approach, picking <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s SHA-256 algorithm for its appeal to established miners. Our 30 coin block reward was arrived at by the toss of the dice, gotta love that Vegas style! A key factor in our decision to use SHA-256 algorithm was because the majority of crypto enthusiasts have invested a lot of money in equipment that only mines using this algorithm, wrote Greg, of WankCoin. We wanted people to be able to mine Wankcoin with ease, utilizing equipment they already had with minimal or no new investment. With <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s current difficulty it is becoming unprofitable to mine the currency, rendering this equipment almost obsolete. And once those parameters are picked and new coin is launched, typically via a post on the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Talk announcements forum, creators still need to take steps to promote it to would-be users and miners. Getting coins listed on exchanges, where users can buy them using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> or traditional currency, has gotten harder as the number of coins has exploded, said Tim Renzetti, the creator of HempCoin. "The folks who were in it in the beginning got on the exchanges pretty easy, he told me. "We were a month or two months after PotCoin, so getting on the exchanges was not a big goal for us, but it should have been. Some older currencies were also premined, Renzetti explained, meaning the currencies launched with a set of coins already in the creators control. Premining helped some coins get off the ground by letting creators give them away to target users, or sell them IPO-style to raise money to promote the coins. But investors and miners are now wary of the practice after a series of pump-and-dump style scams where creators dumped their premined coins, then essentially abandoned their currencies. "For anyone coming in the game right now, it would be very, very difficult, said Renzetti, who added that he still thinks different geographical regions and different industries will ultimately settle on different <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span>. "You would have to have money to do it, because the idea of having a premined coin is not gonna happen any more. The community won't allow it." For anyone coming in the game right now, it would be very, very difficult. Alongside the announcements of new coins on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Talk are warnings about poorly planned coins and outright scams, sometimes called shitcoins. In some cases, users have even spotted hidden premines embedded in the source code powering various coins, usually letting the creator of the first blocks in a coins chain claim arbitrarily large rewards, letting coinmakers secretly sell large quantities of the coin as soon as exchanges open. Let me describe the scenario, one <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Talk user wrote in warning of a possible scam. Dev releases some shitty [anonymity] system, gets all the IPO money. Dumps all the hidden premine and vanishes into the crypto-fog. With premining out of fashion, coin creators should expect to spend about 10 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> of their own funds supporting a launch, one of the anonymous creators of GroinCoin wrote me in an email. That includes developer time for the coin software and website, ads and marketing, and coins for targeted giveaways and faucets—websites and automated programs that distribute coins either for free or in exchange for promoting the coin online. It is not cheap, and it can rarely be done by one person, wrote the GroinCoin creator. For its part, GroinCoin had a successful launch, despite more initial mining attention than its creators anticipated, according to the email. Bursts of mining have become a common issue for new currencies, after the creation of multipools—groups of miners who move in tandem from currency to currency, targeting the greatest monetary reward for the least computing power and pooling their collective earnings. Newer coins with small dedicated bases have adopted new, more complicated algorithms to set mining complexity, since simpler approaches like taking a rolling average over time dont react well to a sudden influx or departure of multipool miners. People with large hashing power tend to jump between currencies, and without per difficulty block adjustments, the people left mining often face difficulties in the form of extended block finding times, wrote WankCoins Greg, explaining that WankCoin uses an algorithm called DigiShield to stabilize difficulty rates. This is Reddcoin. But even with countermeasures in place, multipools generally push down the price of new coins, since a rising price will be counteracted by multipool mining and selling, said ReddCoin's Ren. Given the huge amount of hash power at the disposal of multipools, any price increase attracts more hash power which leads to more sell pressure which in turn causes the price to decrease, he wrote in an email. An equilibrium is achieved when the price stabilizes at the cost of mining plus a thin profit margin (for miners). It's simple economics. ReddCoin itself is in the midst of switching its mining algorithm to a new formula called proof-of-stake velocity that seeks to give coins to active, dedicated fans of the currency, not just users with the most powerful computers. PoSV minting, the counterpart to [traditional proof of work] mining, requires little computing power or energy and can be done on CPUs of PCs, laptops and even mobile devices, according to ReddCoins description of the new algorithm. Every Reddcoin user will automatically become a PoSV minter. Even so, Ren said many currency creators dont do enough to differentiate themselves technologically and economically, and effectively disappear after just a few weeks of trading. The value of the currency only increases if the developers and community are dedicated to building the ecosystem over a long period time, he wrote.

When <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> first launched, it was possible to mine coins with a regular computers CPU. But as the currency grew in popularity and value, miners moved first from the CPU to graphics cards, which were better suited to the rapid-fire arithmetic needed to quickly compute possible hash values, and then to machines with specialized mining chips called ASICs, for application-specific integrated circuits. Partly to make mining practical on ordinary computers again, some currencies deliberately use different hashing algorithms than <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, so machines built to mine <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> dont have the same advantages over ordinary household computers. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Litecoin">Litecoin</a></span>, often said to be second in popularity to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, uses a hashing algorithm called scrypt, as do its many variants, including the Shiba-Inu-meme-inspired <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></span>. And with scrypt-focused ASICs now on the market, other currencies have switched to still more esoteric hashing algorithms, including one formula called X11 that combines the output of 11 different functions into one hash. One currency, called <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=PrimeCoin">PrimeCoin</a></span>, requires that hashes be linked to certain chains of prime numbers of interest to mathematicians, so miners are potentially doing scientifically useful work as they record transactions and generate new coins. Creators of new cryptocurrencies must choose all of the mathematical settings for their coins: the target mining rate, the hashing algorithm, the number of coins given per block to successful miners, and the total number of coins to be created, among others. VegasCoin, for instance, tops out at 100 million total coins, compared to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s 21 million and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Litecoin">Litecoin</a></span>s 84 million. Generating too many coins can mean the currencys not worth enough to motivate miners and investors; generate too few, and the currency can be worth too much and impractical to spend. We tried to be modest with our total number of coins to help ensure a higher value in the future, wrote VegasCoins Yates. Our 30 coin block reward was arrived at by the toss of the dice, gotta love that Vegas style! Yates team picked <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=LiteCoins">LiteCoins</a></span> scrypt-mining algorithm to make the coin more approachable to at-home, amateur miners. Other coins take the opposite approach, picking <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s SHA-256 algorithm for its appeal to established miners. Our 30 coin block reward was arrived at by the toss of the dice, gotta love that Vegas style! A key factor in our decision to use SHA-256 algorithm was because the majority of crypto enthusiasts have invested a lot of money in equipment that only mines using this algorithm, wrote Greg, of WankCoin. We wanted people to be able to mine Wankcoin with ease, utilizing equipment they already had with minimal or no new investment. With <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s current difficulty it is becoming unprofitable to mine the currency, rendering this equipment almost obsolete. And once those parameters are picked and new coin is launched, typically via a post on the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Talk announcements forum, creators still need to take steps to promote it to would-be users and miners. Getting coins listed on exchanges, where users can buy them using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> or traditional currency, has gotten harder as the number of coins has exploded, said Tim Renzetti, the creator of HempCoin. "The folks who were in it in the beginning got on the exchanges pretty easy, he told me. "We were a month or two months after PotCoin, so getting on the exchanges was not a big goal for us, but it should have been. Some older currencies were also premined, Renzetti explained, meaning the currencies launched with a set of coins already in the creators control. Premining helped some coins get off the ground by letting creators give them away to target users, or sell them IPO-style to raise money to promote the coins. But investors and miners are now wary of the practice after a series of pump-and-dump style scams where creators dumped their premined coins, then essentially abandoned their currencies. "For anyone coming in the game right now, it would be very, very difficult, said Renzetti, who added that he still thinks different geographical regions and different industries will ultimately settle on different <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span>. "You would have to have money to do it, because the idea of having a premined coin is not gonna happen any more. The community won't allow it." For anyone coming in the game right now, it would be very, very difficult. Alongside the announcements of new coins on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Talk are warnings about poorly planned coins and outright scams, sometimes called shitcoins. In some cases, users have even spotted hidden premines embedded in the source code powering various coins, usually letting the creator of the first blocks in a coins chain claim arbitrarily large rewards, letting coinmakers secretly sell large quantities of the coin as soon as exchanges open. Let me describe the scenario, one <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Talk user wrote in warning of a possible scam. Dev releases some shitty [anonymity] system, gets all the IPO money. Dumps all the hidden premine and vanishes into the crypto-fog. With premining out of fashion, coin creators should expect to spend about 10 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> of their own funds supporting a launch, one of the anonymous creators of GroinCoin wrote me in an email. That includes developer time for the coin software and website, ads and marketing, and coins for targeted giveaways and faucets—websites and automated programs that distribute coins either for free or in exchange for promoting the coin online. It is not cheap, and it can rarely be done by one person, wrote the GroinCoin creator. For its part, GroinCoin had a successful launch, despite more initial mining attention than its creators anticipated, according to the email. Bursts of mining have become a common issue for new currencies, after the creation of multipools—groups of miners who move in tandem from currency to currency, targeting the greatest monetary reward for the least computing power and pooling their collective earnings. Newer coins with small dedicated bases have adopted new, more complicated algorithms to set mining complexity, since simpler approaches like taking a rolling average over time dont react well to a sudden influx or departure of multipool miners. People with large hashing power tend to jump between currencies, and without per difficulty block adjustments, the people left mining often face difficulties in the form of extended block finding times, wrote WankCoins Greg, explaining that WankCoin uses an algorithm called DigiShield to stabilize difficulty rates. This is Reddcoin. But even with countermeasures in place, multipools generally push down the price of new coins, since a rising price will be counteracted by multipool mining and selling, said ReddCoin's Ren. Given the huge amount of hash power at the disposal of multipools, any price increase attracts more hash power which leads to more sell pressure which in turn causes the price to decrease, he wrote in an email. An equilibrium is achieved when the price stabilizes at the cost of mining plus a thin profit margin (for miners). It's simple economics. ReddCoin itself is in the midst of switching its mining algorithm to a new formula called proof-of-stake velocity that seeks to give coins to active, dedicated fans of the currency, not just users with the most powerful computers. PoSV minting, the counterpart to [traditional proof of work] mining, requires little computing power or energy and can be done on CPUs of PCs, laptops and even mobile devices, according to ReddCoins description of the new algorithm. Every Reddcoin user will automatically become a PoSV minter. Even so, Ren said many currency creators dont do enough to differentiate themselves technologically and economically, and effectively disappear after just a few weeks of trading. The value of the currency only increases if the developers and community are dedicated to building the ecosystem over a long period time, he wrote.

But no one has actually caught the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus while in the U.S., and contrary to sensational media headlines, humanity isn’t doomed by the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in West Africa.

                                The news: The world's first commercial space launchpad may not be built in Cape Canaveral or Houston. Instead, the first rockets to lift off from a designated commercial facility will embark from one of North America's poorest — and perhaps, least likely — cities: Brownsville, Texas. Of the Brownsville-Harlingen metro area's nearly half a million residents, 36% live below the national poverty line. Close to a quarter of those 25 or older have only a high school diploma; 37% never graduated high school.

Doctors quickly concluded it was probably not <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, but some minor panic ensured nonetheless.

Mount Sinai Hospital said in a statement that a male patient arrived at the hospital’s emergency room on Monday morning complaining of a high fever and gastrointestinal problems. The patient had recently returns from a trip to a "West African country" where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> has been reported. The hospital says the patient was placed in "strict isolation” and is being screened for the deadly virus. Jeremy Boal, Chief Medical Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System, told reporters that the hospital plans on working carefully with the CDC to make sure the patient does not have the deadly virus.

More than 700 West Africans have died, and the battle is far from over. Who is really to blame? How about greedy pharmaceutical companies? Scientists have made great strides in developing an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccine, but so far exactly zero candidates have made it past the stage of clinical trials. Vaccines, which require billions of dollars to research and develop, rely on funds from pharmaceutical companies. So despite the fact that many vaccines have made it to the first level of testing, they often can't surpass the intervening hurdles without a big push from private corporations. Here's the problem: Pharmaceutical companies, for whom decisions must make sense financially, won't take a risk on investing in a vaccine for a disease that only surfaces periodically in low-income countries. Governments and research universities are supposed to help by filling the funding gap. Read More

                                From 1990 to 2010, deaths from chronic kidney disease (CKD) rose by about 82% worldwide—the third largest increase among the top 25 causes of death after <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> (396%) and diabetes (93%). In England, about £1·45 billion was spent on caring for people with CKD in 2009–10, just 1·3% of National Health Service spending, and a substantial proportion of this cost was devoted to renal replacement therapy in the small proportion of patients with kidney failure. In July, the UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its clinical guideline on CKD, aiming to ensure consistent identification of CKD and thereby improve management.

                                There are some articles journal editors will wish they hadn't brought to public attention. But there will also be papers they are immensely grateful to have published. One such Lancet paper is Julio Montaner's truly landmark 2006 viewpoint entitled, rather modestly now looking back, “The case for expanding access to highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] to curb the growth of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> epidemic”. The paper began by charting, since its inception in 1996, the rise and impact of HAART. Montaner and his team went on to hypothesise that, “A prevention-centred approach would therefore argue that treating 100% of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected individuals at once could greatly reduce <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission.

                                JUDGING from the condemnation, Facebook just “friended” Satan. The company has been pilloried for academic research it published, showing that by adjusting its users’ news feeds so that a greater proportion of positive or negative items appeared, it could nudge people to post slightly sunnier or gloomier items themselves. For sociologists, the study provided evidence of “social contagion”—the spread of ideas and moods through imitation and conformity—without face-to-face contact.That Facebook runs similar tests all the time for commercial reasons—to get users to linger longer, or to click on ads—was largely lost on the critics. And the most telling bit went unnoticed: the difference in posting behaviour was between 0.04% and 0.1%. It sounds paltry, and is. But to Facebook’s data scientists, it amounted to a smashing victory. “Given the massive scale,” they noted, “even small effects can have large aggregated consequences.”This may indeed be the unspoken secret of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>.
