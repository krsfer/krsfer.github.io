                                The news: Health authorities admitted Tuesday that the West African <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus epidemic is accelerating very quickly and may soon outpace the ability of medical teams to contain it. Meanwhile, the grim situation is being made worse by a massive strike among Liberian health care workers, who have accumulated large amounts of unpaid wages while suffering from overwork and the constant risk of exposure. "It's spiraling out of control. The situation is bad, and it looks like it's going to get worse quickly," Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden told NBC News. "There is still a window of opportunity to tamp it down but that window is closing, and we need to act now. ... This is different than every other <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> situation we've ever had.

                                International medical agency Medecins sans Frontieres said Tuesday the world was "losing the battle" to contain <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> as the United Nations warned of severe food shortages in the hardest-hit countries. MSF told a UN briefing in New York that world leaders were failing to address the epidemic and called for an urgent global biological disaster response to get aid and personnel to west Africa. Leaders are failing to come to grips with this transnational threat," said MSF international president Joanne Liu. "The (World Health Organization) announcement on August 8 that the epidemic constituted a 'public health emergency of international concern' has not led to decisive action, and states have essentially joined a global coalition of inaction."

                                Travel restrictions could worsen West Africa's <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic, limiting medical and food supplies and keeping out much-needed doctors, virologists said Tuesday as the disease continued its deadly spread. The worst-ever outbreak of the haemorrhagic fever, which has hit Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Guinea the hardest, has seen airlines cancel flights and several countries barring people from affected nations. "If we impose an aerial quarantine on these countries, we undermine their fight against the epidemic: the rotation of foreign medical staff and distribution of supplies, already inadequate, will become even more difficult," said Sylvain Baize, head of the Pasteur Institute's viral haemorrhagic fever centre in Lyon, France. The World Health Organisation has appealed for the reversal of flight cancellations to West Africa, where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> has killed more than half of the 3,000-plus people it has infected.

The patent appears to cover a method of landing a rocket on a floating platform at sea. In their papers, SpaceX says that "by 2009, the earliest possibly priority date listed on the face of the patent, the basic concepts of 'rocket science' were well known and widely understood. The "rocket science" claimed in the '321 patent was, at best, 'old hat[.]'" Blue Origin has approximately three months to file a preliminary response to the challenge.

                                Apple has issued a statement about the 100-plus celebrity iCloud accounts allegedly hacked for nude photos. Dozens of nude photos were first released on anonymous message boards AnonIB and 4chan over the weekend. There are a lot of theories about how this could have occurred, but one of the most prominent suggests multiple hackers spent months getting into the seemingly secure accounts, either because they were hired to steal the photos or so they could trade the images for other things online, like more nude photos or <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin">bitcoin</a></span>.  Celebrities who were hacked include Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, singer Ariana Grande, and model Kate Upton. Apple seems to be denying responsibility, although it says it was "outraged" to learn of the breach. Apple spent 40 hours investigating the situation and concluded: "None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone." Apple is continuing its investigation and working with law enforcement officials to uncover more information. Here's Apple's full statement: We wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities. When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple’s engineers to discover the source. Our customers’ privacy and security are of utmost importance to us. After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet. None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud® or Find my iPhone. We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved. To protect against this type of attack, we advise all users to always use a strong password and enable two-step verification. Both of these are addressed on our website athttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4232. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: Alleged Hacker Behind Massive Leak Of Nude Celebrity Photos Says It Took 'Several Months' To Pull Off Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                With the school year getting started, AD takes a look at cutting-edge architecture in academia. 1. British architecture office Foster & Partners brought its brand of finely detailed design to Yale University, creating a rectilinear jewel box of a home for the institution’s Edward P. Evans Hall, Yale School of Management. A glass envelope gives way to open, light-filled corridors and public spaces, while lecture halls are housed in 16 drum-shaped modules clad in luminescent blue panels (seen at far left and far right).   2. For the new Krishna P. Singh Center for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Nanotechnology">Nanotechnology</a></span> at the University of Pennsylvania, firm Weiss/Manfredi designed a striking three-story building with a transparent front façade and planted roof. Sensitive to the demands of biological research and the delicate equipment the building would house, Weiss/Manfredi worked to isolate vibrations and noise from a nearby subway line and mitigate other external environmental factors to create an efficient, beautiful research hub.   3. The London School of Economics’ new Saw Swee Hock Student Centre was built into a tight triangular site in the dense English capital by Irish studio O’Donnell + Tuomey Architects. 4. An ovoid clad in silvery stainless-steel panels and a rectilinear tower covered in tiles in various shades of red form a striking pair of new buildings (called Silver Mountain and Red Cliff, respectively) at the Senzoku Gakuen College of Music in Kawasaki, Japan, some 11 miles southeast of Tokyo. Created by Japanese studio K/O Design Studio, the unconventional forms house rehearsal spaces.   5. Bands of windows snake up the brass-paneled exterior of SOM’s design for the New School’s University Center, revealing a staircase that broadens and narrows as it climbs to create flexible meeting spaces in this nexus of student life at the New York City institution. The center includes classrooms, dormitories, and computing labs.   6. Zaha Hadid Architects created this cast-in-place-concrete edifice for Lebanon’s Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut. The structure’s dramatic 69-foot cantilever minimizes its overall footprint and maximizes public courtyard and plaza spaces below. 7. For the Library and Learning Centre at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, Zaha Hadid Architects devised this dramatic instructional center, comprising a main structure (which tilts at a 35-degree incline) and a second space that cantilevers dramatically from its base over a plaza below. Clad in fiber-reinforced concrete, the building is marked by ribbon windows that streak and swerve across its façade. 8. Thomas Phifer and Partners’ expansion of Lee Hall at the architecture school of Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina, is a light-filled glass-and-steel edifice that plays counterpoint to the campus’s more traditional brick structures. 9. At the Glasgow School of Art, American firm Steven Holl Architects crafted a luminous five-story structure as an addition to the original 1909 building. The Reid Building is sheathed in a translucent laminated glass and includes art, design, and architecture studios, as well as a café, an exhibition hall, and other ancillary rooms.

                                There is more sea ice in the Arctic this summer than there was two years ago in 2012, a fact that has led to misleading stories that imply that there's more uncertainty about what's happening in the Arctic than there actually is. But comparing right now to two years ago and drawing conclusions about climate from those isolated data points is like saying "it's cold outside, guess we don't have to worry about global warming." It's an absurd comparison that doesn't take into account all the available information. Although Arctic sea ice waxes and wanes with the seasons, it covers the smallest area in late September of every year — which is why, since we've been able to measure the extent of the ice with satellites, we look at the area covered each year and talk about what that means. So does the fact that there is more Arctic sea ice now than there was in 2012 mean that global warming has stopped or that it's really not as bad as some people claim it is? No, it doesn't — and this graph by the National Snow and Ice Data Center that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> tweeted out yesterday very clearly shows why: The graph that really matters http://t.co/FF2AQ0hg15 pic.twitter.com/0Xk2arTzvW — <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> (@elonmusk) September 1, 2014 This chart shows the extent of Arctic sea ice at its minimum from 1979 to 2013, compared to the average amount of minimum sea ice. As Phil Plait points out over at Slate, there are several times where the level of sea ice jumps up from the year before, but the overall trend is still down. The trend is what really matters, he says. In 2013, there was more sea ice than there was in 2012 — 1.97 million square miles as opposed to 1.32 million — but that's still substantially less than the average minimum extent of more than 2.4 million square miles. On August 17, 2014, sea ice was measured at 2.36 million square miles, which while that's higher than 2012 it's already below the average approximately a month before it usually hits its minimum level. Yes, there's more ice now than there was in 2012, the year that the amount of sea ice hit the smallest extent ever recorded, according to NASA. That year, ice levels were also influenced by other external factors, including the melting of an ice dam that led to a sudden influx of warm water into the Arctic. As NASA's sea ice scientist Walt Meier explains, "while this year is not heading toward a record low minimum extent in the Arctic, sea ice is well below normal and continues an overall pattern." It's the pattern that matters. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: 30 Award-Winning Photos Of Nature Taken By Scientists READ MORE: Why Cold Weather Doesn't Mean Global Warming Isn't Real Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                Data At Work profiles data scientists working at the cutting edge of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>. Suppose data scientists could track how people move through cities and towns as easily as e-commerce sites track them online? Don't answer that. It's already happening—thanks, at least in part, to a startup called StreetLight Data. StreetLight founder and CEO Laura Schewel was working on a doctorate in energy engineering at UC Berkeley when she had the “ah-ha” idea of using data from cell towers, traffic-data aggregators and GPS satellites to track people's movement patterns in cities and states across the country. Streetlight Data founder and CEO Laura Schewel Initially, Schewel figured the information might help traffic engineers plan new highways and parking. But the data her system aggregates turns out to be useful for much, much more. How To Track Without Tracking Like it or not, it's ridiculously easy to see how people behave online. Cookies and more sophisticated techniques let advertisers track individuals across websites, in part because the online environment is controlled (in just about every sense of the term). This type of tracking, and the related task of gathering insights into peoples' behavior, is much more complicated in real life.  The basic problem is one of putting together all the pieces of a massive puzzle that don't exactly fit. How do you get and make sense of the data generated by ordinary people in order to say with any degree of certainty—in generalized and anonymous but still analytically useful ways—where they shop, which highways they take or even whether they're more likely to take the train on Fridays when the Giants are playing and traffic is lousy in San Francisco? See also: Why Data Scientists Get Paid So Much For StreetLight, it all starts with the cellphone. It probably won't surprise you to know that major carriers collect detailed location data as your phone registers with different cellular broadcast towers (thus providing a detailed record of your movements). But you might not have known that carriers sell access to that data in a format that basically provides a movement record for large chunks of the population. It's all anonymized: The data consists of map plot coordinates and the ID numbers that identify particular phones, with the latter run through a one-way hashing function designed to yield unique numbers that can't be matched to the original IDs.  The carriers also provide matching demographic information for subgroups of the anonymized individuals—their family composition and educational status, their estimated income and the census block they live in. StreetLight buys this data and connects it with other detailed census data and other demographic information. What it ends up with are richly detailed databases that can be used, say, to generate the average profile of someone who might be shopping at Whole Foods at 5pm, dropping a child off at school on a Monday morning, or commuting from San Francisco to the East Bay to work.   Put that way StreetLight sounds sounds sort of creepy—and maybe it is. Schewel and her team, of course, stress that safeguards such as those one-way hashes make it impossible to tie aggregated data about groups back to individual users. “There is no way for us to actually map anything back to individuals. All that data is stripped out long before we get it,” Schewel told me. At the same time, de-anonymizing such information tends to become easier over time, in part because individuals are generating increasing quantities of data about themselves that can serve as a cross-reference to pinpoint actual identities. Whether or not such privacy concerns have merit, this type of data can provide valuable information in a variety of situations. Think companies deciding whether and where to expand; city and transit planners projecting the need for new zoning, transit or roadways; and perhaps developing nations planning new infrastructure and even entire cities. Turning Data Into Information The process by which StreetLight maps together these very different types of data into a coherent dataset turns out to be fairly straightforward. Every month, Schewel’s team receives a messy glob of about 400GB worth of geospatial data from mobile carriers and other data providers. That doesn't sound like much—even given that the load is expected to reach 800GB a month next year—considering that StreetLight's movement patterns cover much of the continental U.S. (The company occasionally also scrapes up Canadian data by accident, and has to discard it.) But geospatial data is fairly lean and has a small footprint, Schewel says. The data is added to StreetLight's existing multi-terabyte data store. StreetLight then pushes the data through a custom extract, transform and load process run through Talend, a popular <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> integration tool. This trims out unnecessary information and reformats different types of data into a uniform schema. Along the way, this process matches up different types of data—cellular-tower location, traffic reports, census patterns, other data sources—at different geographic scales ranging from census block to town or city to region, and along expressways or other transit corridors. All that data gets referenced to particular geospatial locations and, in many cases, to specific time periods as well ("all the time," "weekdays," "rush hour," etc.). What StreetLight Knows About Us All that work links together disparate types of data in a meaningful way, making it possible to get a good sense of where people who fit a particular demographic profile spend their time—and when. Say, for instance, you wanted to know more about people who shop at the Stanford Mall. The StreetLight database might tell you that people over 50 with graduate degrees who live in high-end neighborhoods shop there all the time; families with children from middle-class and high-end neighborhoods shop there on weekends (especially in August and December); and people without college degrees only visit the mall on Monday evenings in the spring. Now that's data transparency. StreetLight can, for instance, help out a retail chain that's thinking about opening a new store with better information about its prospective customers. For instance, whether the average shopper in a proposed mall location earns closer to $50,000 or $100,000, has one child or three, or is a 50-year-old females or a 21-year-old male. As you can imagine, such data is incredibly valuable, and not just to companies. As Schewel explained it to me: We can actually show what might happen if, say, a new freeway off-ramp would be built or a road is changed or even if a big snowstorm hits. We can do this by finding days in the past when an event creating similar conditions occurred. It’s much better than running simulations because it's real behavior. For a decent degree of confidence, StreetLight needs a sample size equal to at least 1% of the population of any location. Schewel prefers 5% to 6% for better signal fidelity, though. X-Raying The Average Shopper Already, StreetLight is proving its worth in some unexpected ways. In 2013, the Oakland Business Development Corporation (OBDC) wanted to increase economic activity in downtown neighborhoods where hundreds of commercial properties lay vacant. Oakland locals, too, were spending up to three-quarters of their retail dollars elsewhere, in part for lack of options. Foodies in the East Bay knew the downtown Oakland dining scene was on fire; OBDC, a nonprofit urban-development agency and business lending organization, tried to capitalize on the boom by courting retailers and developers. But it struck out when its prospects looked at demographic data on nearby neighborhoods, many of which are low-income areas, and backed away. OBDC turned to StreetLight for a clearer picture of downtown Oakland's commercial prospects. Its data revealed that the area regularly draws a healthy mix of wealthy, middle-class and lower income people. OBDC used those findings to convince skeptical store owners to consider locating downtown. But the organization, which also makes loans to retailers, put the data to broader use—primarily to confirm that the area's shopping demographics could support a variety of store types. "That data helped us fill dozens of vacant storefronts over the next year," says Jacob Singer, OBDC's president and CEO. Singer is now considering purchasing StreetLight data as part of retail and urban planning efforts around an upcoming bus-based rapid-transit project slated for downtown Oakland in the next few years. "There really are no comparable alternatives that provide data this detailed and accurate for urban planning and project assessment," he says. Reading The StreetLight X-Ray VeggieGrill, a rapidly growing vegetarian fast-food chain, signed up with StreetLight to learn where people who most closely matched the vegetarian demographic tended to shop and spend their time. Other retailers are using StreetLight data in reverse. Men's Wearhouse, for instance, uses StreetLight not just to spot new store locations, but to identify underperforming stores based on traffic patterns and shopper demographics. StreetLight's data often reveals unexpected patterns—or their absence. Sometimes it shows big differences in the types of shoppers that frequent two adjacent shopping centers, or surprising discrepancies between stores and their neighborhoods. “We can also tell a store chain that the wealthy people who live around a location rarely go to that store,” says Schewel. "For some customers, we have seen surprising dead zones where you would think a ton of people would shop but in fact few venture in." Beyond Shopping Schewel has big plans beyond helping merchants optimize their store locations. Like, for instance, improving public planning in developing countries with detailed data. “Many of these countries don’t have a census and don’t really know how people are moving around, so our information would be the first real data," she says. And since countries that never had widespread land lines often have denser cellphone networks than the U.S., Schewel thinks StreetLight could provide even more detailed user data. Ultimately, StreetLight’s data could also help answer more difficult questions about whole-day transport patterns. These patterns reflect complex human decisions that result in behaviors and traffic patterns that are hard to analyze in isolation. As Schewel told me: We can capture the entire traveling day of citizens. Rather than just seeing what happens when someone is going from home to work, we can see that people have not taken public transit because they have to pick up their child from school or that they are more likely to go to a supermarket to buy groceries on Friday night. This type of detail lets everyone that needs to know how people move see cause-and-effect far better than before.

                                Dweller of dark Thisworld and Otherworlds, chronicler of "street" and assembler of mechanisms to go beyond, John Shirley breathes forth a smoggy twilight that is the end of the American Dream. A novelist at 18, tutored by Dune's Frank Herbert, Ursula LeGuin, and Harlan Ellison, Shirley is the closest known phenomenon to being our Edgar Allen Poe. Shirley can also be (and should be, though he is reticent to cop to it) credited for having discovered William Gibson—in an introduction to Shirley's book City Come A-Walkin', Gibson wrote "so carelessly shoved me toward the writing of stories, as into a frat-party swimming pool.") Because of their friendship, and with Gibson now granted by literati the mantle of "original cyberpunk novelist," colleagues will—perhaps must—measure their words. I spoke to Shirley about his often-black craft; of his early involvement with psychedelia and cocaine addiction, then of "putting the phone down," and the creation of his newest novel, Doyle After Death. Motherboard: How would you define "cyberpunk?" Why did this so-called literary movement bust out in a blast in the early-to-mid 1980s, stretching into the mid-90s (though we both know that Frank Herbert's Dune; Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and many of William S. Burroughs' works were written much earlier...) John Shirley: Traditionally, cyberpunk is identified with "the street" having its own special uses for technology. By the street we mean the poor, the hustlers, criminals, the demimonde, the disenfranchised. People talk about law enforcement agencies using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s—but <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s will also be used by drug dealers to watch for cops. You can order a good <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> with a camera off the internet right now! I just saw a "hobby <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>" used in a park.  Cyberpunk is also a tone. It's very urban, dystopian, but also about having the courage to face the dystopian world. There's a transhumanist thing going on in it too—people merging with technology.  Certainly PK Dick was an influence on it; also Cordwainer Smith, Samuel Delany, John Brunner, Ballard. And I'd say cyberpunk's influences also include non-genre writers, like the beat writers, William Burroughs, or the edgy poets like Baudelaire and Rimbaud. And early progressive rock and goth—generally the more intelligent rock—and electronica. Gibson and Sterling loved to listen to Sisters of Mercy together... And if anyone wants to try out my cyberpunk, the ideal book is A Song Called Youth, which is a trilogy of cyberpunk novels in one volume, updated, from Prime Books. Could not resist slipping that in there. You met William Gibson, whose Neuromancer is often touted as the cyberpunk novel. Please describe your involvement with his becoming a known name. Gibson and I met on a panel where we were the only ones who knew the difference between Edgar Rice Burroughs and William Burroughs. We noticed that in the discussion, and he and I both referenced specific surrealist artists, and bands like the Velvet Underground. We also shared some drug references. But I can't tell you anything about his drug use... [Ed. note: Shirley later wrote to clarify, saying that "Gibson had some early run-ins with the usual mind-altering suspects but never was big into drugs. At this point he doesn't even drink alcohol."] So we knew were kindred spirits and yet "odd men out" in the world of science fiction. I was in the punk band Sado-Nation, lead singer, and Gibson came to see us. He took a photo of me on stage that appeared in Heavy Metal magazine (the comics mag which also had an arts review section). He stayed a night on the sofa of our big smelly gruesomely untidy punk rock commune of a house in Portland, and said he half froze down there, I recall.  A young Shirley, as photographed by Marc Laidlaw. Image courtesy John Shirley He wrote an intro about me in this intro to my novel City Come A-Walkin' and in other places. I used to think of myself as the Lou Reed of cyberpunk and Gibson as the David Bowie. Ah, the fantasies of youth...  Later we worked developing movie ideas, and had some optioned but they weren't made—well, a version of an adaptation of his story "The New Rose Hotel" was made, but we chose not to have our names on it. Also here at this link is an account of how my novel Black Glass originated as a Shirley/Gibson script. (He later gave me the rights to it—just gave 'em to me.) Gibson and I wandered around the East Village in the 1980s a few times, smelling it, observing it. Alphabet Town, as it was called, was a block from where I lived. People were lined up down the stairs of tenements, to go up to locked doors with little windows cut in them, where they bought heroin in bags that were stamped with symbols for the different "street brands." We observed these things. I remember telling him I'd heard that the people working at some of these elaborate, tolerated heroin distribution organizations got benefits and vacation time and health care! I recall Gibson being very into Leonard Cohen in those days, and you can pick up resonances of Cohen lyrics in some Gibson prose. He was also into John LeCarre, John D. MacDonald, and Thomas Pynchon, as well as the better SF, like Ballard and Delany. We listened to bands like The Birthday Party and Sisters of Mercy. He was first published in UnEarth Magazine before I met him. But I certainly helped the world get to know Gibson, because I gave one of his first really strong cyberpunk stories to someone at OMNI magazine, in manuscript, and said "Read this!" and they published it.  OMNI really was his first big break. His second one was the novel Neuromancer. And who published Neuromancer? Terry Carr bought it for Ace Specials... and where did Carr hear about Gibson? Me. I recommended he get a novel by him. So there! Gibson sure helped me in his time—included me as a collaborator in his first story collection, dedicated Neuromancer to me and Bruce Sterling, got me a Hollywood agent. You were publishing novels by age 26 (Transmaniacon; Dracula In Love), followed at 27 with City Come A-Walkin'. That's a good blast of creativity at the age that many writers experience their true calling and really "find their legs." Did you "study writing," or did God—however defined—simply touch you?  I wrote my first novel when I was 18; it was published as my second novel, Dracula in Love. Transmaniacon was written when I was early 20s. Took a while to get published. I tended to absorb good writing in English. It's just the way my brain works, that kind of absorption I mean, so I was teaching myself by reading a lot, all kinds of things. Then I went to writing workshops, the Clarion Writers Workshop, where the likes of Ursula LeGuin, Robert Silverberg, Harlan Ellison, Frank Herbert, Avram Davidson, and Terry Carr were on hand to teach me, for six weeks, one writer per week.I was mercilessly workshopped by the other would-be writers and the pros. Gus Hasford, who wrote Full Metal Jacket, was a student then, and Vonda McIntyre.  I was young—and at one point took acid and ran around like a lunatic on the University of Washington campus and jumped out of a tree at Harlan Ellison... But mostly I wasn't stoned there, I was just innately weird. That I always was.  Anyway, Damon Knight and Kate Wilhelm also helped me at Damon's Milford West workshop. And I just learned as I went, often by making mistakes and doing things you weren't supposed to be allowed to do in writing. I all-too-freely engaged in delirious and delusional experimentation. Hence my novel High, which is finally back out again as an ebook. usually I don't describe drug experiences in my fiction. I usually describe life, just life as we live it, or as we may in the future. I was influenced by rock music too. For a long time my paperback novel writing was my day job to pay for my bands in Portland (Sado-Nation) and New York (Obsession). I was lead singer songwriter and still do that stuff. And still write lyrics for the Blue Oyster Cult. Somehow the music was all part of it. As for advice... It's hard to give it now, at least for me, as everything is so different. When I came up there were lots of paperback publishers and lots of editors reading manuscripts. Now it's hard to get something read. Some old-guard writers are throwing their perfectly good new novels into drawers in despair because even they, despite their long publishing history, can't get them read. Sometimes people get lucky with self publishing, but mostly they don't. I haven't tried it. It's a little more possible to get short stories read, so that's one place to start... Maybe try to break into graphic novels, with the aid of a good artist? Then jump from there to film scripting? You can go to conventions and talk to agents and editors there. If they like your ideas you might get a shot. Try to come up with something that's timely and yet hasn't been done. Read a lot. Be reasonably literate, use good grammar, write in sharp, genuine sentences. Don't try to write if you don't like to read. Which writers set you off, got you going, initially? And how did the parallel/alternate/futuristic worlds—most of it dark—come to interest you as a creator of fiction? Who turned your crank and urged you toward the "Yeah, yeah, I wanna do that" impulse? There were a number of people, probably starting with Harlan Ellison. People like Robert Sheckley, RA Lafferty, too. But Ellison had a potent energy I responded to. He had a kind of electrical authority in his writing and to me that was exciting. It spoke to the hungry writer in me.  I identified with his point of view: dark, with subtle satirical attitude. His willingness to create his own version of the fantastic interested me. He was science fiction in I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, but really it's a kind of gnostic (unintentionally!) allegory. A lot of his fantasy writing is something like urban magic realism. So I liked that he defined his own genre and that's what I have done. I was also excited by Kurt Vonnegut, his ability to make crystal clear symbolic statements with good strong narrative. He didn't care about genre. It was whatever worked. You studied under Frank Herbert, whose Dune remains to me even today as the trippiest book I've ever read. His writings struck me as his being a "head" straight away. He was very clearly occupying a space, not just "as a writer," but in his own psychology, which is not of this Earth. There are rumors online—yeah, so what?, but...—that he was an enthusiast of magic mushrooms. Any truth to that; insight that you can provide? I remember Frank Herbert saying that magic mushrooms provided insight, and some of the spice in Dune was inspired by his experiences, yes. Frank Herbert was one of my teachers at the Clarion Writers Workshop. I wouldn't attribute a great deal of the book to his drug use though, as he was always an accomplished science fiction thinker, and master of extrapolation. However, the idea of prescience as he uses it in Dune may also have been obtained from psychedelics. You've said that you no longer use drugs; by the "no longer," any half-bright fellow will know that you once did. Being more interested in how (or if) psychedelics played a part in the coalescence of ideas which formed your early cyberpunk/neo-futuristic works, I'm always interested—as a novelist, short story writer and psychedelics aficionado myself—what LSD and mushrooms did to spark your creativity and get you writing? I was writing before I took psychedelics—I published in underground papers as a teen—but they did affect me later. They will spur insights and ideas and occasionally some of those found their way into my writing. Often I tried to evoke the psychedelic mood or "energy." I remember having a distinct sense of a bodily electricity communicating, along with tactile communication, while on psychedelics during sex with a girlfriend, and this was something that was reflected in sex scenes I wrote. And being young I worked a lot of those in, early on.  Shirley performing in the early days. Image courtesy John Shirley I no longer take drugs. I would smoke pot, except it doesn't really make me feel good. Oh, later in life I might do magic mushrooms once more, and I might consider taking DMT exactly once. But I got that message, already, no need to stay on the phone.  My novel City Come A-Walkin' is partly about my feeling that cities are organisms, with their own minds, each one having a collective unconscious mind distinct to it, and I suspect I got some of that from being on mescaline at rock concerts and seeing a kind of mass-mind, an overall organic connectivity, the physics of communing through the medium of rock... and then later I applied that to the mass movement of cars and people in a city. Later I described the character Rickenharp's impressions, in parts of my trilogy A Song Called Youth, while he's on an imaginary designer drug, a kind of psychedelic/cocaine amalgam, Blue Mesc. Also, a vision I had on drugs of consciousness at large in the universe appears in several of my books including The Other End.  But usually I don't describe drug experiences in my fiction. I usually describe life, just life as we live it, or as we may in the future, and I try to see it through the lens of higher consciousness. Some of that came from early drug experiences, but much of it arises, now, from mindfulness meditation. Addictive drugs and the horror of hardcore addiction comes up in my novels—I went through a period of cocaine addiction. You'll find it in Black Butterflies and the novel Wetbones. Also in A Song Called Youth you have the "Six Kinds of Darkness" scene in which a guy shoots up the psychic/psychological essence of his best friend. He actually mainlines his best friend! I've satirized meth heads and meth generally in my novels Demons and Everything Is Broken. I'm just plain anti-meth unless someone has a prescription for amphetamines to treat narcolepsy. As for what drugs I did—in my time I did acid, mushrooms, hash, opium (once), and found those to some extent instructive. I think they can be used intelligently. But I do not believe in overdoing drugs. I think that genuine MDMA can be helpfully used therapeutically, but I think that recreational use of X is risky. For one thing, it's rarely what the dealer says it is. You are quoted [in Pop Matters Website], as saying, "...people dumb as a glass box of hammers, are allowed to have children. May as well give a loaded pistol to a toddler. Its a dark world, and writers must reflect that. In order to find your way out of the darkness, you first have to peer closely into it..." I concur with this view, by the way. You are also on-record many times—notably in a TED presentation in Brussels, Belgium, 2011—in your belief that global warming is one of the greatest dangers to humankind today. I'll press your buttons here by positing that if "we" (humankind) are too dumb to self-regulate our own childbirth output, too dim to recognize that we are polluting ourselves and neighbors out of sustainable existence, we are, in fact, a ridiculous parasite on this Earth and that the planet on which we live will simply slough us off—as it well should—and will bounce back without evidence of we even being here, come two or three thousand years. Your thoughts (in as much detail as you wish)? I would recommend reading my "the next 50 years" piece here. Basically I think that climate change, which in this case genuinely is caused mostly by humanity, is just one part of the environmental problem. Overfishing, toxification of the seas, pesticide use, weedkillers, prescription drugs in water, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>, continued air pollution, toxicity in food, destruction of animal habitat, attrition on bee colonies—all this is converging. And we'll be facing the consequences for several hundred years. I believe humanity will survive, and it won't be surviving like Road Warrior or the Morlocks from The Time Machine, but I think we'll have some cruelly ugly social consequences. We'll have famines the like of which we've never seen before, along with higher risk of wars—I do predict a third world war in the second half of this century but I don't think it will be a nuclear war—and I think we'll suffer so hugely we'll be forced to have a change in consciousness to adapt.  Population of the Earth may fall from a high of 9 billion, say, to 4 billion rather quickly. Billions may die. But I think humanity will survive and eventually, in a couple hundred years, it will thrive. For every greedhead there's at least one person who wants to make a difference, wants to help, wants to change things for the better, and is willing to cooperate. I couldn't help but noticing that the TED audience response to your prescient and irrefutable offerings was very nearly mute silence. As a regular TED watcher, this was stunning and very telling. They clearly did not want to hear your message; and which bonds with mine own dark outlook: That (the upper 90 percent of) humankind is both pernicious in its parasitism and too stupid to realize that it is shitting its own nest with toxic effluvia. Play "World Social Director," if you would. What—aside from attrition of the dumb—could change this stone-obvious reality? Some at TED told me they found my talk inspiring. But it was darker than they'd come to expect from that series. In a few hundred years we'll have a global government—that doesn't mean no nations, it means a kind of strongly empowered United Nations and this will be, on the whole, a good thing.  I think it will establish, as per my book New Taboos, new basic laws, environmental, labor, and human rights laws universally enforced. And that will produce a healthier world. In the meantime, we'll lose a lot of beautiful animals through mass extinctions and a lot of beautiful wilderness—too much of it will become wasteland... We may end up having to "terraform" the Earth itself, to some extent. In your most-recent novel, Doyle After Death, you have someone who has just crossed over, after becoming worm food, and who doesn't quite "get" this new dimension. He is helped with clues by Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Afterlife and alternate realities, you are consistent (laughs). How did this book come about, and what did you do that was new—literary and consciousness tricks—as opposed to previous works? Doyle After Death is a novel, it's fiction, so I can just go with the assumption for this fantasy, that life after death exists, and I can freely play with that premise. And I did. But I'm not saying life after death does not exist for real. I don't know, not having died (or if I've died, and reincarnated, I can't recall it).  It happens that the creator of the character Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was also a Spiritualist, a person who interfaces with spiritual mediums, so called, who channel spirits from the afterlife. Spiritualists have a whole religion and philosophy based on this, kind of interwoven with theosophy.  when you get to the afterlife, there's always another "high" over there... at least in my novel. You can always ascend to a new level. Doyle was a bit of a contradiction. He created the super-rational Sherlock Holmes yet Doyle irrationally believed many of these "mediums" were not charlatans. He was a physician, a kind of scientist, yet he also believed in fairies. He was a very good man, however, a brave man, who tried to help people, and he did in real life use powers of deduction to help people who were falsely accused of crimes. While Doyle was a Victorian Englishman who died in the early 20th century, the narrator of Doyle After Death is a low-budget Las Vegas detective who dies from mixing bad pills with booze, in his cheap Vegas room, and wakes up in a place called Garden Rest, which is one tiny corner of the vast world of the afterlife. And he soon meets Arthur Conan Doyle there and becomes his "Watson" in the afterlife. They don't solve mysteries as ghosts in our world. The entire novel happens OVER THERE in the next world, so that I can speculate about what that might be like. For me it's like world creation in science fiction. What would the afterlife be like, at least one I could believe in? It's not going to be heaven or hell, but there will be darkness and light there. As it happens, things are not so ethereal in the Afterworld, as it's called. It has its own physics, its own ecology, its own biology. Things are different but... I don't want to give it all away. And yes, there are crimes there. Doyle and Nick Fogg solve the crimes.  I did a lot of research on Doyle to make him authentic and I put in considerable work making this afterlife world internally logical. And by the way, there's dope there. That is, there's something called Frip, which is a kind of parallel to marijuana, but not the same really. It grows wild there.  There are many strange things in the spiritual wilderness of the afterlife. But just so your readers know, when you get to the afterlife, there's always another "high" over there... at least in my novel. You can always ascend to a new level.  The novel, of course, contains metaphysical speculation. Some of it resonates with my own spiritual belief in the path to higher consciousness and self knowledge. But ultimately, like everything else I write, Doyle After Death is the best storytelling I can do. It's just a very strange story I'm telling...

                                First an alligator, now a ram. Another day, another animal getting hot pissed over a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> flying too close for comfort. Small-fry <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, of course, are revolutionizing the way we see, study, and conserve the animal kingdom, even if the very act of flying a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> still hovers in legal gray areas in many parts of the world. We've seen everything from anti-poaching conservation <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in Kenya to whale-monitoring <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s off the California coast offer unprecedented access and views of animals—and what's threatening them. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> let us get close to animals. But then, it's the allure of getting closer, ever closer to wildlife that can tempt a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> operator over the line. Suddenly, observation looks more like harassment. Can you blame Angry Ram for, well, being a ram and charging YouTube user Buddhanz1's quadcopter?  Really, what did Buddhanz1 think would happen here? They're called rams for good reason. "I got a bit close," Buddhanz1 writes. "Luckily no harm done." What I really want to know, is if this Angry Ram is the same GoPro-mounted Angry Ram that smashed up that jerk on the motorcycle. The world might never know. Either way, mountain justice has been served.

They had significantly greater reductions in body fat than the low-fat group, and improvements in lean muscle mass — even though neither group changed their levels of physical activity. While the low-fat group did lose weight, they appeared to lose more muscle than fat. They actually lost lean muscle mass, which is a bad thing,' Dr. Mozaffarian said. 'Your balance of lean mass versus fat mass is much more important than weight.

                                Bottled and ready to go.NIAID/SGK Handout The current outbreak of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in West Africa has emerged rapidly and evolved with alarming ease. An unprecedented number of lives have been lost and WHO predictions are that the virus will infect in excess of 20,000 people before the situation can be brought under control. This is an extraordinarily challenging time for the nations affected, many of which have fragile, inadequate health infrastructures and have been unable to contain the outbreak. International efforts are now required to strengthen and implement comprehensive emergency response strategies across the areas affected and most at risk. Accelerated development An important part of the measures to be implemented involves fast-tracking access to treatment and vaccine options in order to reduce morbidity and mortality rates and help stop transmission. The gravity of the current epidemic is such that for the first time in history an international consortium has been assembled in order to accelerate the development and deployment of potential <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccines. At the Jenner Institute in Oxford we will run the first phase I trial of a vaccine targeted at the Zaire strain of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus that is causing the current outbreak. The main purpose of this first-in-humans trial in the UK is to establish a detailed safety profile of the vaccine and assess the type of immune responses it induces before it could be considered for widespread use. A further goal is to identify the most suitable dose of the vaccine. The vaccine is being co-developed with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the National Institutes of Health who are running parallel human phase I trials in the US. Our trial is being funded with a £2.8m grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development. Chimpanzee adenovirus ‘Cold’ virus in chimps is being used to deliver dose. Onkel_wart, CC BY-NC-SA The candidate vaccine in question uses a chimpanzee adenovirus (a type of respiratory virus) as a means to expose or prime the immune systems of volunteers to a specific protein that exists on the surface of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. The vaccine contains some genetic material but not the entire <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus genome so it cannot cause an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> infection. As with the US trial, the adenovirus also will not replicate but instead prompts the person vaccinated to express an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccine that the immune system will later recognise if the person became infected. Previously it has been tested in animal models and has demonstrated impressive effectiveness at protecting against infection and promoting recovery from animals later exposed to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>. Just a single dose was required to induce very high levels of protective efficacy. Chimpanzee adenoviruses have been used extensively in clinical trials for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria">malaria</a></span>, hepatitis C and other infections but no vaccine of this type has been licensed as yet. In the 25 clinical trials of chimpanzee adenoviruses that have taken place, the safety profile of this type of vaccine has been good. At present, ethical and regulatory approvals are being prioritised so that the trials may begin in the UK in September 2014. This will be run in parallel with a cohort in the US and extended to The Gambia and Mali shortly thereafter. At the same time, 10,000 vaccine doses will be stockpiled by GSK in order that, should the vaccine meet safety requirements, it may be deployed without any further delays. The candidate vaccine will be tested in 60 healthy volunteers over the age of 18, who we will shortly begin recruiting. During the trial volunteers will be administered a single dose of the vaccine into the muscles of the upper arm and blood samples will be taken at specific time points. In all, volunteers will be expected to attend for a total of nine clinic visits over six months. Clinical trials are an essential part of the vaccine development process and invaluable tools when it comes to understanding and ultimately improving the processes that provide vaccine-mediated protection from disease. In order gain the upper hand over <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, we need all the help we can get.

                                Online and mobile can also make a difference.Legnan Koula/EPA With a high fatality rate and a terminal phase that causes bleeding and haemorrhagic fever, the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus has always attracted grisly fascination, yet funding and action against it have never been particularly high. The current outbreak in West Africa is unprecedented – it has now killed more than 1,500 people – and it appears to have stimulated a chain reaction, from treatment using experimental drugs and fast-tracking human trials, to mapping the genomes of the virus in order to gain better understanding of the species involved. But what has prevented this outbreak from being easily contained is the lack of public health infrastructure in the region. Preparedness The current outbreak in West Africa should stimulate a complete shift in public health policy. If future occurrences of this and other emerging diseases are to be prevented or their impact minimised, we need to learn a great lesson now. An effective treatment for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> would be good, a vaccine to prevent the disease even better, but the best thing that could come out of this is a more organised and trusted public health system. First and foremost, none of the developing countries that have been hit, including Liberia, and Sierra Leone, were prepared nor had the capacity to manage the outbreak. For this you need trained personnel and a good public health infrastructure. For example, it was only after the outbreak that many hospitals saw the need to create quarantine units or holding centres, despite <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> being a real health risk. Getting people to come forward to be immediately isolated has been a problem. Communication The publicity given to the outbreak has also been unprecedented – thanks to the 24/7 news cycle, the internet and affordable mobile phones. Good communication is crucial, but it’s clear that media can be used to spread bad as well as good messages. Monrovian mobile phone repairer. Themepap, CC BY-NC In Nigeria, which thankfully has not seen a full-blown outbreak, panic as well as the rumour that drinking or bathing in salt water can prevent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> infection has led to at least two deaths. In Liberia, where a national curfew was set up, violent clashes took place in the West Point slum area of Monrovia after a quarantine was ordered. While tension is perhaps inevitable, the situation could have been managed better. Without being able to drive home alternative messages to build trust, counter the stigma of the disease and tell people what symptoms to look out for and what to do, then there will be a problem. Mobile phones are now affordable for many in African countries and are an asset for disseminating useful health education, particularly during emergencies. However, the information must come from trained public health officials with an appropriate background in risk communication – rather than those only interested in sensational news broadcast. These skills could better assist politicians, the press and government officials in communicating appropriately. Bush meat. JB Dodane, CC BY-NC There are also cultural issues around the eating of game meat (bush meat), a delicacy in most West African cultures and the likely origin of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus, like plague, rabies, psittacosis, Lyme disease and others, are zoonotic diseases or infections transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans. It should follow, then, that avoiding or protecting the species that harbour them would be one plausible approach for preventing future outbreak. This would mean beginning a process of reconciling the protection of the species for biodiversity with that of zoonotic disease prevention. In other words, some wildlife species known to harbour pathogens that are transmitted to humans such as monkeys, bats, chimpanzees, should be regulated. Firmer commitments There is the need for national governments in Africa to start or improve their public health infrastructure and health staffing to address future outbreaks of infectious diseases which are inevitable – particularly in view of climate change effects and the resulting shift in disease spread. Despite a commitment in the Abuja Declaration to allocate at least 15% annual budgets to health care by 2015, only six countries in Africa – including Liberia – have met this goal. According to World Health Organisation figures about a quarter of African Union member states were spending less on health now that they were in 2001. Now is the perfect time to push for countries to make good on their promises. And it will also impact other big problems such as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, tuberculosis and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria">malaria</a></span>. Public health is all about preventing diseases before they happen and in poorer countries, the need is even greater. Moving forward, individual African nations and in collaboration with the African Union, should formulate public health policies and statutes for training, research and developing infrastructure in line with what obtains in more technologically advanced nations. This must come in addition to the clinical research around the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus itself. By so doing, the WHO and Centers of Disease Control in the US and the respective ministries or departments of health in West Africa can share data and best management practices for addressing these emergencies in the future. There are other issues such as the enormous economic losses and ratings agency Moody’s has already warned of the potential impact of the virus on the region. So when it comes to costs, it is better for African counties to avoid being penny wise and pound foolish by investing more in preventive rather curative measures that may or may not exist in the future.

                                Steroid use is growing in Australia but not among the usual suspects.Jhong Dizon/Flickr, CC BY Steroids are easy to scapegoat. Users are viewed as aggressive, violent and mentally unstable, able to snap at any moment and cause great harm to the people around them. Ostensibly, it is this perception of steroid users that has led the Queensland government to enact tougher penalties for steroids. The Safe Night out legislation increases the maximum penalty for possession or supply of steroids to 25 years in jail. But tougher steroid laws are unlikely to have an impact on violence in the community because a) most steroid users are not violent, and b) other substances, including alcohol, are stronger risk factors for violent behaviour. Who uses steroids? The public perception of steroid users doesn’t match the reality. The first red flag comes from demographic data. It turns out that in the United States, the typical steroid user is male, around 30 years old, has a bachelor’s degree, is employed full-time in a white-collar occupation, earns an above-average income, and does not play any form of competitive sport. Local data is lacking, but smaller studies of Australian steroid users corroborate this profile. In a large US study of nearly 2,000 steroid users, the most-commonly reported occupations were in sales and marketing, information technology, banking and finance, health care, management and executives, and skilled labour. The least-commonly held occupations? Athletes, coaches, personal trainers and the military. So these men don’t sound like a particularly violent bunch, but aren’t steroids still linked with increased aggression and violent behaviour? How steroids affect behaviour Some studies suggest that steroid users are more aggressive and irritable than non-users. Further, some population-based studies have found links between self-reported anabolic steroid use and self-reported involvement in aggressive and violent behaviour. Arguably, however, the best data comes from studies where anabolic steroid use is objectively tested and violent behaviour is confirmed through legal records rather than self-report. To this end, a Swedish retrospective cohort study that compared registered criminal activity among individuals who had tested positive for anabolic steroids to those who had tested negative for steroids found that those who tested positive were no more likely to have committed violent crimes. In fact, after controlling for substance abuse, the researchers found a lower risk for crimes against property among those individuals who tested positive for anabolic steroids. A general limitation of studies on steroid use and violent behaviour is that few have controlled for other forms of substance use, including alcohol. A recent Swedish study examined the link between anabolic steroid use and violent crime in a sample of 3,594 remanded prisoners and found that 28% reported using steroids at least once in their lifetime. Prisoners who reported any lifetime use of steroids were 1.7 times more likely to be suspected of a violent crime. However, there was no temporal relation between the use of anabolic steroids and the suspected violent crime. In contrast, there was a four-fold increase in the risk of violent crime if alcohol had been consumed 24 hours earlier. The average amount of alcohol consumed in the 24 hours prior to a violent offence was 107 grams, equivalent to 10.7 Australian standard drinks. Alcohol is a stronger risk factor for violent behaviour than steroids. AAP Image/QLD Police A second Swedish population study of 10,365 men found that 4.9% had been convicted for a violent crime and 0.7% reported anabolic steroid use. Further examination showed that violent offenders were five times more likely to report anabolic steroid use than non-offenders. But after controlling for other forms of lifetime substance abuse, including alcohol, this association lost statistical significance. In other words, once the researchers looked at alcohol and other drugs, it appeared that anabolic steroids were not at all associated with violent crime. Steroid use is probably not a proximal risk factor for violent behaviour. Rather, co-occurrence of abuse of other substances, including alcohol, are probably more to blame. Another possibility is that using anabolic steroids makes people more susceptible to the violence-inducing effects of other substances such as alcohol or amphetamines, an idea which has some support in animal research. Cost of penalising steroid users The potential benefit of tougher laws on steroid use to curb violence and antisocial behaviour must be weighed against the potential costs. The proportion of steroid users who disclose their use to health professionals, which is already low, will likely fall. Community health-promotion services, such as needle exchanges, may see a drop in visits from steroid users concerned about the potential for discovery and prosecution. Steroid use is undoubtedly growing in Australia. In New South Wales in 2007, the proportion of needle exchange service-users who reported that their last injection was steroids was just 2%. But by 2012 this had increased sixfold to 12%. Queensland fared no better: rising from 2% in 2007 to 11% in 2012. By 2012, almost two-thirds of all new service-users, or “new initiates,” reported that their last injection was anabolic steroids. These men are not competitive athletes or criminals. Overwhelmingly, they are men who are unhappy with their appearance and want to look better. For some, large parts of their self-worth or self-esteem are tied to their bodies and their appearance. If building muscle becomes a preoccupation, a mental condition called muscle dysmorphia, formerly named “reverse anorexia”, may develop. Little wonder that up to 50% of men with muscle dysmorphia also use steroids. Derisively labelling steroid users as vain or narcissistic “gym bros” and disparaging their culture as “bruss” betrays a deep lack of compassion. There is a reason why extreme dieting and self-induced vomiting grew faster among Australian males than Australian females between 1998 and 2008 and a reason why teenage boys consistently rank body image among their top three major life concerns. Male action figures are becoming bulkier. SandyJo Kelly./Flickr, CC BY Our culture celebrates physically attractive and “masculine” men: tall, muscular, stiff upper-lipped. Research shows that media portrayals of men have become more and more muscular during the past few decades and the rise in steroid use in contemporary Australia is a symptom of men succumbing to body image pressures. Solving this problem demands a compassionate understanding of the psychology behind why men start to use steroids. Too often we turn to outright denigration. We do not publicly berate girls for their attempts to look more attractive, so why do we berate men? Tougher steroid laws are unlikely to have an impact on violence in the community. Rather, the steroid-using community will be driven further underground, making it more difficult to deliver health services to this misunderstood and under-served group of people, allowing the problem of steroids in Australia to grow even larger.

NIAID My social media accounts today are cluttered with stories about “mutating” <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> viruses. The usually excellent ScienceAlert, for example, rather breathlessly informs us “The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus is mutating faster in humans than in animal hosts.” But what does that even mean? Should we be terrified of mutant viruses? The story is based on a paper just published online at the journal Science under the title Genomic surveillance elucidates <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak. It’s a timely piece of genetic detective work sequencing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus genomes from 78 patients in Sierra Leone. Viruses accumulate genetic changes through mutation and selection within a host, so the team sequenced multiple viruses from several of the patients making up 99 genomes in total. They found that mutations - minute changes in the virus genetic code - have accumulated rapidly, both during infections of individuals and during the outbreak of the current epidemic. The accumulation of genetic changes can tell us about the dynamics of an outbreak because when one patient infects another, the virus in the second patient is the descendant of the virus in the first, and contains all mutations that had accumulated in the first, plus any new mutations that occur in the second patient. The Science paper concludes, from studying these changes, that the current West African outbreak comes from a single zoonotic infection (when a virus crosses from an animal to humans, which is how <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreaks start). The virus, living in animals like fruit bats, last shared an ancestor with the Middle African strains (which have repeatedly infected people in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo) in approximately 2004. The virus behind this outbreak made the jump to humans late last year, in Guinea. The key event in the spread to Sierra Leone was the funeral of a faith healer who claimed to be able to cure <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients. When she contracted <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> and died in late May, a large number of people attended her funeral. Twelve of the first <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> cases in Sierra Leone all attended that funeral, and appear to have contracted the virus there. These include two distinct forms of the virus which diverged, in Guinea, in late April. This paper represents a superb piece of investigative genomics. Because <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> viruses replicate (make copies of themselves) so rapidly and the epidemic has spread so quickly, there exist many small changes in the virus genome with which to track what has happened. Are the mutations dangerous? And those changes have accumulated far faster since the virus made the jump into humans, triggering the current epidemic. Which is the finding behind the headlines that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus is mutating rapidly. Nobody can tell whether mutations happen more rapidly in human infections than in the reservoir host animals where most viruses live. What has happened is that mutations have accumulated twice as fast in the course of this infection as they typically do during the long stretches living in other animals. So when Reuters' Julie Steenhuysen writes “more than 300 genetic changes in the virus as it has leapt from person to person”, she’s not talking about some mysterious, sinister process that literally happens in the air between one host and the next. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> isn’t even an airborne disease; it is transmitted in bodily fluids. These mutations are simple mistakes in the genetic code, made when the virus is replicating within a host. With millions of replication events during thousands of infections, a huge number of mistakes happen. Steenhuysen quotes study lead author Pardis Sabeti (Harvard University and the Broad Institute) who points out just how mundane this process really is: We found the virus is doing what viruses do. It’s mutating. The majority of mutations either render the virus useless at doing its job, or have no effect. Its “job” being to make more copies of the virus and occasionally to infect another host. So the mutations that do get passed on are usually the very few that succeed at improving the rate of virus replication, or the rate of infection. Exactly how many of the mutations alter the effectiveness of the virus at replicating and being transmitted, and how they do so, remains to be established. And the study’s authors certainly expect this to be an important follow-up: Since many of the mutations alter protein sequences and other biologically meaningful targets, they should be monitored for impact on diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies critical to outbreak response. When mutations arise - and they always arise - and effect the way in which an organism (yes, I know some people don’t like calling viruses “living organisms”) makes copies of itself, we have the two main ingredients for natural selection. There can be no clearer or more frightening illustration of natural selection and its inevitable result - biological evolution - in the modern world. For some, reason, however, the popular press doesn’t like calling evolution - the most important biological process of all - by its proper name. “Mutation” and “development” are neither synonyms, nor euphemisms for evolution. A new host spurs new adaptation The reason mutations have accumulated so rapidly during this epidemic is that the virus is in a new host - human beings. While other versions of the virus have jumped across to humans before, the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> viruses currently ravaging West Africa have spent all of their history in other animals. They are now adapting to human bodies, tissues and immune systems. The mutations that help the virus work most effectively in the human body and transmit most effectively from sufferer to uninfected victim are the ones we are going to be hearing a whole lot more of in the coming months. So we have little to fear from mutating viruses. It is the rapidly evolving viruses, fixing the mutations that randomly occur like typos in a Tweet, that we should seriously fear.

                                Yobarnie at North Richmond in the 1960s. The area is the subject of a disputed development that featured at ICAC last week. P.A. Yeomans, Water for Every Farm, a practical irrigation plan for every Australian property, 1973 Last week the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) began investigating a political donation of A$18,000 made by Nathan Tinkler’s Buildev corporation. The 2010 donation helped fast-track approval for 1,400 medium-density homes in Sydney’s western suburb of North Richmond. Local residents have long been opposed to the development; they claim it will choke already congested roads in and out of the area. But recent news reports have missed a crucial aspect of the development proposal: it will obliterate a site of national heritage significance. The proposed housing development is marketed as Redbank, but to proponents of sustainable agriculture, the 180-hectare property is more readily recognisable under its former name, Yobarnie. From the mid-1940s, Yobarnie is where Australian inventor P.A. Yeomans carried out the world’s first experiments in Keyline Design. He trialled dams, water channels and ploughing techniques to retain water in the landscape for as long as possible. Yeomans' work is widely acknowledged as one of the major influences on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=permaculture">permaculture</a></span>, an ecological design system which began in Australia in the 1970s. Prior to purchasing the property, Yeomans worked as an engineer with particular expertise in the supply and drainage of water on mine sites. The acquisition of Yobarnie marked the beginning of his application of these hydrology skills to agriculture. He began to experiment with harvesting rainwater via a set of interlinking dams. He used gravity to irrigate the entire farm. After much trial and error, Yeomans finally developed Keyline Design, a method of “reading” the landscape. He allowed the land itself to determine the best placement of roads, buildings, paddocks and dams. Rather than imposing a rectilinear grid, the land’s own contours were decisive factors in a whole-system approach to farm design. The result was a strong increase in soil fertility and water retention without the need for artificial fertilisers. Ian Milliss and Lucas Ihlein, New Chisel Plow Shank, 2011, offset lithographic print from Yeomans agriculture brochure. The importance of Yobarnie was acknowledged in 2013, with the property added to the NSW State Heritage Register. Yobarnie was listed for its historical, associative, aesthetic and social significance, as well as for its research potential. It was Buildev’s medium-density housing proposal which prompted a local residents action group to begin assembling a case for the listing. Although the heritage order looks good on paper, its impact on the ground is minor, calling for some modifications in road layout and the installation of interpretive panels. Ironically, the developer of Redbank has since moved to capitalise on the heritage listing, with Yobarnie’s illustrious past now incorporated into its marketing material. Local opponents to the Redbank development have seized on the ICAC investigation to bring attention to the site’s poor infrastructure design. There is only one way in and out via car: the Kurrajong Road Bridge over the Hawkesbury River, already subject to long peak-hour delays. An alternative access point has been proposed, joining Grose River Road to Springwood Road, but this requires the building of a major new bridge across a favorite local swimming spot at Navua Reserve. P.A. Yeomans, The City Forest: The Keyline Plan for the Human Environment Revolution, 1971 In 1971, P.A. Yeomans published The City Forest. The book was a passionate appeal for adaptation in the face of looming ecological crisis, and a technical manual for how this might be achieved. He scaled up his Keyline farm design methods to tackle the complex problem of urban planning. The same principles applied: analyse the situation, allow the land’s contours to determine placement of key elements, and set up water flows and access points so the system functions in a self-sustaining manner. Of course, these suggestions seem hopelessly utopian in the face of Sydney’s property market, even without the spectre of corruption thrown in for good measure. But it does seem particularly frustrating that the proposed development on Yobarnie, where it all began, is now suffering from elementary design faults which could be resolved by consulting Yeomans' own teachings. Redbank’s current masterplan follows the standard medium-density outer-suburban model: single story houses on individually fenced plots of land accessed by private car. But a re-imagined Redbank-Yobarnie could be a model for the sustainable housing of the future. It could easily generate its own power. Water for residents could be provided via the existing network of Keyline dams. Organic waste could be composted on-site, as could human manure, greatly reducing the impact on centralised rubbish dumps and sewerage systems. The resulting soil could be used for integrated local market gardens, a crucial contribution to food production in the face of suburban sprawl. The neighbourhood could include a sustainable design study centre, attracting visitors from around the world. A radical re-design of this sort would be a fitting tribute to Yeomans' heritage. It would put Hawkesbury Council on the map, bringing in tourist dollars and creating opportunities for strategic positioning at the beginning of the post-carbon era. This week Mark Regent and Bart Bassett will face questions at ICAC about the Redbank development. As they do so, the current pause to the development offers the chance to consider a better way to design new peri-urban neighbourhoods. Since 2011, Lucas Ihlein has worked with Ian Milliss on The Yeomans Project, which was presented at the Art Gallery of NSW in 2014. Their next project investigates the potential adaptation of Yeomans' Keyline principles for sugar cane farming in Far North Queensland, to mitigate agricultural run-off into the Great Barrier Reef.

And according to the American Geophysical Union, we may have a candidate: The Yellowstone "supervolcano," a slumbering giant that most recently erupted from beneath Yellowstone National Park 640,000 years ago.

                                Jennifer Lawrence: another victim of 4chan.Will Oliver/EPA The powerhouse of internet virality, 4chan, has achieved notoriety, and in a spectacular way. The release of hundreds of images claiming to show a pantheon of celebrities in various compromising, or at least awkward, positions has brought the many other social media channels alive with the sniff of salacious gossip. Consequently, as mainstream media must so often do in the era of internet and citizen journalism, the newspapers are buzzing with a mixture of horror at the invasion of privacy and the hint of seeing something far more revealing from a famous person than plunging cleavage. The complex circumstances that have come together to make this incident combine all the extremes of social media, mainstream reporting, get-rich-quick schemes, gullibility, celebrity obsession and net-trolling. The Mirror asked how 4chan could have obtained the images. The straightforward answer is that a hacker put the images on 4chan. More uncertain is how the hacker could obtain the images. As worrying as the scale of this hack may sound, many of the stars involved claimed the images were fake. But to add confusion there are also claims that the PR people for Jennifer Lawrence have acknowledged the images as being of her and Mary Winstead recognised through Twitter that the photos tagged with her name were her own deleted images. But what can really be believed in all of this turmoil is difficult to determine. With such a media storm being generated there are opportunities for many to benefit. For the hacker there is a chance to sell some of the even more risqué material to media outlets by taking advantage of the pseudo-anonymity of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin">bitcoin</a></span> exchanges. For traditional media reporting organisations there is the exciting hint of obtaining an exclusive. In the days of internet gossip for a traditional media to obtain an exclusive is almost equivalent to finding a golden egg. And gaining an exclusive could fall either way for these organisations too: identifying the hacker or how they managed the hack would nearly be as good as obtaining a new image or video. Any regular followers of 4chan will not be surprised by the attention the site is currently receiving. It hosted the inception of ideas including Lolcats, Rickrolling, Rage Comics and the Anonymous hackers group. So many of the ideas that first emerged on 4chan have become part of what we all expect and “do” online. But equally the site has been accused of encouraging online harassment and cyber-bullying. Being “cutting edge” without being offensive or abusive is a difficult balance. This is particularly acute for 4chan when it is neither a patrolled or commercial space. There are no advertisers to please or risk offending and the site avoids the greater levels of identity-checking that we all have come to expect from using more conventional social media sites. Unsurprisingly, this means that 4chan is among the first choices for posting the controversial, the new or simply the quirky and ultimately this material could come from anyone. Many other more commercialised social media sites rely on this impetus of creativity, originality and controversy that their own ecosystems cannot provide and do not encourage. In 2010 TheNextWeb identified the five keys lessons to learn from 4chan: “use original content”, “know your audience”, “acknowledge your source”, “don’t copycat” and “make them laugh”. The headline “Hundreds of unseen nude pictures of celebrities from an anonymous hacker”, works on at least four of these criteria. The role played by 4chan on social media is important. For many the site will be unknown. For those who seek it out in the wake of this turmoil the experience will feel as if they are stepping back ten years. For the vast majority there is no need to do anything – 4chan will come to them through shared images and links on other more familiar sites. In its current form, 4chan cannot be easily stopped. The quickest method to stymie this stream of humour, abuse, creativity and bullying would be to buy the site from its creator, Christopher Poole. He declined to sell in 2005 and rumours of a sale to Google in 2012 went nowhere. If 4chan were to shift away from its current cutting-edge role it is certain that a similar site would rise to fill this niche. Without 4chan the internet would be a much duller place. While it is impossible to condone the “dark” activities generated through 4chan, without even knowing it we will all need 4chan for as long it provides us with the shareable content that allows us to be social online.

                                This progression is known as Moore’s law. For more than 100 years, the processing power of computers had doubled every 18 months. Computers and the information technology that they enable are absorbing other fields. So we are seeing exponential advances in sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, 3D printing, and so on.

                                The news: In a major victory for environmentalists, California may soon become the first state to officially ban all plastic bags. The state legislature has narrowly approved a measure to remove all lightweight, single-use plastic bags from grocery, convenience and liquor stores by 2016, grandfathering in the more than 100 cities and counties that have already taken action to ban the bags on their own, according to the Sacramento Bee.  Source: Getty ImagesFierce opposition from paper and plastic bag industry lobbyists and national manufacturing companies now makes signing the bill a tough choice for Gov. Jerry Brown, a moderate Democrat with a long commitment to environmental issues but a mixed record on issues like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>.

                                The news: World Health Organization doctors warned Thursday that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus epidemic in West Africa could eventually grow to as many as 20,000 cases, over six times the currently understood scale. The WHO also said a new containment plan estimates that the number of cases in the worst-hit areas may be two to three times as high as officially recognized. New figures indicated 1,552 of 3,069 confirmed cases have resulted in death in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria, while at least 40% of all cases appeared in just the past three weeks. The epidemic in West Africa has shown no signs of slowing down, and it may soon expand in an unprecedented way that threatens to devastate local populations and overwhelm the region's health authorities.

                                IN 2012 China’s main planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, declared that the country would produce 60 billion-100 billion cubic metres of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> a year in 2020. It needed those forecasts to be accurate.They weren’t. Wu Xinxiong, the director of China’s National Energy Administration, recently predicted that only 30 billion cubic metres a year will come on stream by 2020. That would barely meet 1% of China’s energy needs now, let alone in 2020.This is profoundly disappointing. With more than 30 trillion cubic metres of recoverable <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span>, China has the largest reserves in the world, almost 70% more than in America, home of the shale-gas revolution. It is also a setback to the country’s efforts to reduce pollution. Dirty coal now makes up about 70% of energy consumption and, despite fast growth in renewable energy, gas is the only cleanish energy source that could displace enough coal to rein in carbon emissions quickly.China has found that replicating America’s shale strategy—even with American help—is harder than it expected. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fracking">Fracking</a></span> works by injecting millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale and releasing gas. American shale seams are mostly found in easily accessible areas at quite shallow depths, and formed of rock that is easy to fracture. China’s are mostly deeper,...

Millions of gallons of a cocktail of water, sand and chemicals are injected into the horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale, releasing the gas—and causing violent protests in Europe and parts of America.Geothermal energy, by contrast, has yet to stir much controversy. Most geothermal plants are located where water has seeped down into the Earth’s crust, been heated and forced back up through permeable rock. Drill a well to between 3,000 and 12,000 feet, and the searing water and steam can be released to drive generators.Geothermal is a minnow among power sources. America has the world’s highest installed capacity of geothermal generating plants—3.4 gigawatts’ worth at last count (see first chart)—but they generate only 0.4% of its electricity (see second chart). New “enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS), however, look set to...
