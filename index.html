Dr. Mitlin's team took waste hemp stems and recycled the material into supercapacitors with performance as good, or better, than those built from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=graphene">graphene</a></span>, at a fraction of the raw materials cost. "We're making <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=graphene">graphene</a></span>-like materials for a thousandth of the price - and we're doing it with waste. The hemp we use is perfectly legal to grow. It has no THC in it at all - so there's no overlap with any recreational activities," Mitlin says. <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                By Stella Dawson WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - International agencies are looking into emergency food drops and truck convoys to reach extremely hungry people in Liberia and Sierra Leone, who are cordoned off from the outside world to halt the spread of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus, a top World Bank official said on Thursday. Truckers scared of the highly infectious disease halt deliveries. The Mano River region, home to about 1 million people and an epicenter for the deadly disease, is a major concern and the issue was raised on Wednesday with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, said Tim Evans, senior director for health at the World Bank. “There has been a lot of inflation in food prices and a lot of difficulty in getting food to the quarantined population,” he said in an interview.

The latest operations came after President Barack Obama said the air campaign had achieved its initial objectives but warned of more strikes to protect US personnel in the Kurdish city of Arbil. US Central Command said <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> and fighter jets took part in the latest strikes, the first at 1505 GMT to take out two armed trucks that had been firing on Kurdish forces. The second strike took place just over 30 minutes later, targeting an MRAP -- a heavy armored truck of the type supplied by Washington to Iraqi forces and presumably captured by IS forces in recent months.

                                What do your shopping decisions tell marketers about you?Daniel Lee/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND The days when Coles and Woolworths only sold groceries are long gone. Both are now established players in a broad range of consumer markets, with interests in liquor and hotels, fuel and convenience, general merchandise and mobile phones. With a network of over 1,600 supermarkets, 1,100 service stations, 2,200 liquor stores and nearly 400 hotels, the supermarket duo are now getting ready for a war with Australia’s big four banks. Dubbed the “clash of the titans” by the ABC’s 7.30 program, Coles and Woolworths are said to have entered high-level talks to create their very own banks. In September 2013, Coles took the first steps towards providing financial products to the Australian market when it applied for the necessary licences. In late June 2014, Woolworths registered the trademark Woolworths Money with the Australian Trade Marks Office. While the new trademark enables Woolworths to centralise its financial offerings, such as insurances and credit cards, it may signpost a desire to expand into deposit taking, personal loans, residential mortgages and even superannuation and retirement funds. It appears Coles is following suit and it has registered the trademarks Coles Money and Coles Financial. The two supermarkets have dipped their toes into the banking pool in the past, offering credit cards and insurance policies, while just last month Coles announced it was moving into the personal loan market with GE Capital. But this latest venture has the potential to change the way banks do business. Rather than using standard measures of risk, Coles and Woolworths will be relying on your shopping habits to give them that competitive edge over the other banks. The power of major retailers has sparked protests in the UK as well as Australia. Jon Starbuck/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA An appetite for data Following in the footsteps of the British supermarket retailer Tesco, Coles and Woolworths plan to use shopper data — such as where a customer buys fuel to detect how far they drive — to tailor and develop their financial products. 14.5 million Australians use FlyBuys and Woolworths Rewards loyalty cards, gathering a treasure-trove of data on consumer habits, budgets and lifestyles. Combine this with data from partners like Telstra, Qantas, WebJet and Medibank, it becomes pretty clear that Coles and Woolworths will have an advantage. In a recording obtained by the ABC, Woolworths Director of Group Retail Services, Penny Winn, explained how the company might use this consumer data to assess financial risk. Customers who drink lots of milk and eat lots of red meat are very, very, very good car insurance risks versus those who eat lots of pasta and rice, fill up their petrol at night, and drink spirits. What that means is we’re able to tailor an insurance offer that targets those really good insurance risk customers and give them a good deal. At the other end of the spectrum they will also avoid those customers engaged in risky behaviours, such as people buying a lot of medicines and vitamins to reduce high blood pressure or high cholesterol – or these new banks could charge a higher premium for car insurance to people who purchase performance car magazines. The possibilities are endless. Risky business Graeme Samuel, former chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), believes that ready access to consumer data could be just what is needed to shake things up among the big four banks and force cheaper products overall. One of the masterminds behind Tesco Bank in the 1990s is Andrew Higginson, and he says Tesco’s database of shopper information proved invaluable in developing finance products. Simple examples would be, say, if you had a group of customers who tended to buy their fuel from Tesco in the same place every time, you could deduce that those customers might only travel short distances in their local neighbourhood. In a car insurance sense, that’s a lot safer. There’s a lower risk of accidents than someone who might be driving thousands of miles up and down the country every year. Samuel also points out online giants such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon are already using data to profile consumers and it’s simply the way people now do business. Yet some privacy activists have raised questions about the legality of such practises. Flybuyer beware Independent consumer group Choice says customers of both supermarkets may not be aware of how much information they are giving away. An evaluation by Choice of the various rewards programs available found most of these programs offer such poor rewards that you generally save less than a dollar per $100 spent. In return the supermarkets gain access to a well of information, including whether you’re a smoker, prefer organic produce or buy low-fat margarine. We have no doubt this looming combination of shopping, financial and insurance data will give Coles and Woolworths unmatched power to segment markets, tailor offers and mitigate their risks. The supermarkets will claim the use of “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” will inevitably lead to lower costs for safer drivers and financially responsible consumers, and this is a good thing. But we wonder if customers will continue to part with their information so freely if they become more aware of the impact it has on other parts of their lives, such as the cost of their insurance or home loan.

                                How can <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> help us to better understand the cinema habits of movie-lovers around the world?Kenneth Lu/Flickr, CC BY-SA The backlash against “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” studies is well underway. And no more so than in the area of humanities and creative arts research. If I had a dollar for every person who has told me over the past year or so that you can’t learn anything about art/culture/society from studying “the numbers” I would be my own independently financed research institute by now. And yet the current and important debate about private telecommunications data, prompted by proposed revisions to national security laws, shows just how revealing large-scale transactional metadata can be. Since the end of 2012 a team of researchers at Deakin and RMIT universities has been gathering global film business data to determine and measure the critical factors affecting film industry performance in a period of transition. The project, called Kinomatics, is also an opportunity for us to assess the usefulness of metadata-driven research for a field like cinema studies. What is kinomatics? The term “kinomatics” is derived from the word “kinematics”, the study of the geometry of motion, and “kino”, a term for cinema. We like to think of Kinomatics as the study of the industrial geometry of motion pictures. As such it is not at all like the typical approach to university-based cinema research. This visualisation shows the distribution of cinema “playweeks” around the world – that is, the day of the week on which films open. Alwyn Davidson/Kinomatics Kinomatics is part of a broader, emerging disciplinary shift in the humanities, away from a traditional focus on measuring the value and meaning of cultural artefacts (such as films) to recognising instead the significance of cultural flows and transactions. Kinomatics began as the offshoot of an Australian Research Council-funded project examining the contemporary business of cinema distribution and exhibition in Australia. The film business is, and has been from the outset, a global enterprise. So in order to really understand Australia’s film economy we quickly realised we needed a more global perspective, one that could account for the cinema’s international, interdependent, overlapping and uneven networks. This image describes the predominant films screening in Australia on Boxing Day 2013. Blue: The Hobbit 2; Green: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty; Purple: Frozen; Orange: Anchorman 2; Yellow: Philomena; Grey: Other titles. Alwyn Davidson/Kinomatics Our focus had shifted from trying to understand which particular aspects of which particular movies might explain film industry performance – Was it the depressing script? Was it the inadequate budget? – to a more systemic overview. This adjustment in turn required us to find different sources of evidence to answer our questions. (What is the impact of environmental conditions on film diffusion? What are the spatial and temporal dimensions of cinema circulation?). Rather than the content of the films themselves we were much more interested in the metadata that describes the cinema’s social, institutional and commercial transactions. Working with Big Cultural Data: three supersize takeaways The Kinomatics dataset that forms the basis for our research is a unique collection of more than 250 million “showtime” records, capturing information about all film screenings in 48 countries over a 30-month period (2012-2015). The locations of the cinemas around the globe that are contributing data to Kinomatics. Alwyn Davidson/Kinomatics Kinomatics adopts many of the techniques that have been developed in recent years within the Digital Humanities. These include the use of APIs, visualisation techniques and data analysis approaches based around the making and mining of the horizontal relationships between data (rather than the vertical relationships favoured by archivists, for example). As one of the first “big cultural data” projects of its kind, Kinomatics has been a massive learning curve for the research team. Here are our top three takeaways as we’ve come to grips with our supersized database: 1. It’s not how big your data is, it’s what you do with it that counts. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> doesn’t necessarily refer to the size of the data (after all today’s “big” data is tomorrow’s iota) but it does mean that the size of the data is one of the problems that need be resolved. In fact, in Kinomatics the data just keeps growing. Through further integrating different types of data (demographic data, social media data, technical infrastructure data, economic and financial data and climatic data, for example) we have been able to explore the value of an “expanded” approach to cultural data, rather than simply focusing on the idea of one “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>set” per se. 2. Big Cinema Data requires a “big” range of expertise. We are a collaborative team with a wide range of skill sets. And yet we could always do with more. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big data">Big data</a></span> studies involve accumulating your evidence base before you begin to develop your approach to it. This iterative and exploratory approach differs from conventional academic methodologies. We often confront colleagues who believe that working with data involves proposing a query and, hey presto!, an answer magically appears on the screen. Working with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> involves careful consideration, multiple iterations, experimentations and interpretations. It’s a process of constant decision-making. In a sense <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> studies are always in beta. In our experience the bigger the team, the more considered the approach can be. 3. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> does not always lead to Big Breakthroughs. In part, the backlash against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> represents a classic Gartner hype curve trough. But data scepticism is important. No matter how large your dataset, it is never comprehensive and it is never unbiased. In our experience we have been able to make assertions about specifically defined research problems that account for the type of data and the way it has been gathered. For example, part of our interest in the factors concerned with the diffusion of film across cinemas around the globe is to better understand the factors that drive diffusion and diversity in domestic film markets. We’ve explored this by looking at a range of case studies such as the spread of High Frame Rate technologies via the release of The Hobbit movies; the volume of transactions between cinema nations expressed in the form of dyadic networks; the relationship between the flow of remittances (the money sent home by migrants) and the movement of Indian films around the globe; and engaging everyday cinemagoers with our dataset through the CinemaCities Ranking index. Working with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> requires a changed mindset. Researchers need to be able to work at scale and be comfortable answering questions with probabilities rather than definitive conclusions. Perhaps the critical question now is not what we can do with the data as much as what the data is doing to us as researchers.

According CAVIRTEX, the installation of its six new machines in Canadas largest metropolis, goes a long way in establishing Canada as the BTM capital of the world." (S)ix new BTMs in Toronto and four more to roll out across the country shortly, Canada now has more BTMs than anywhere else on the planet, said the company release.

Using a cellphone with a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> wallet, users can buy up to $3,000 worth of Canadian currency, in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, by scanning a QR Code generated by the BTM.

And despite how they look, the machines do not dispense the terrible beer Molson Canadian. The BTMs were produced by Ottawa-based BTM technology company BitAccess that helped unveil a similar machine in Canada's capital back in January.   With plans to install four more machines in Canada (Vancouver, Niagara, Ottawa and Halifax), the company is leading the Canadian BTM market. CAVIRTEX (pronounced see-eh-virtex according to the company) was part of unveiling the worlds first BTM in Vancouver in October last year.

According CAVIRTEX, the installation of its six new machines in Canadas largest metropolis, goes a long way in establishing Canada as the BTM capital of the world." (S)ix new BTMs in Toronto and four more to roll out across the country shortly, Canada now has more BTMs than anywhere else on the planet, said the company release.

And despite how they look, the machines do not dispense the terrible beer Molson Canadian. The BTMs were produced by Ottawa-based BTM technology company BitAccess that helped unveil a similar machine in Canada's capital back in January.   With plans to install four more machines in Canada (Vancouver, Niagara, Ottawa and Halifax), the company is leading the Canadian BTM market. CAVIRTEX (pronounced see-eh-virtex according to the company) was part of unveiling the worlds first BTM in Vancouver in October last year.

                                Yesterday we ran Part One of this two-part video. This is part two. To recap yesterday's text introduction: Detroit recently hosted the North American Science Fiction Convention, drawing thousands of SF fans to see and hear a variety of talks on all sorts of topics. One of the biggest panels featured a discussion on perhaps the greatest technological disappointment of the past fifty years: Where are our d@%& flying cars? Panelists included author and database consultant Jonathan Stars, expert in Aeronautical Management and 20-year veteran of the Air Force Douglas Johnson, author and founder of the Artemis Project Ian Randal Strock, novelist Cindy A. Matthews, Fermilab physicist Bill Higgins, general manager of a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a></span> company Dr. Charles Dezelah, and astrobiology expert Dr. Nicolle Zellner. As it turns out, the reality of situation is far less enticing than the dream -- but new technologies offer a glimmer of hope.

                                The FBI has had an eager eye on surveillance <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s since first experimenting with remote control airplanes in 1995. But budget cuts nearly ended the Bureaus unmanned machinations in 2010, and it took a dedicated push aimed at making <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s a tool the FBI cannot do without to cement their place in the FBIs surveillance toolkit. The near termination—and subsequent expansion—of the FBIs <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> program over the past four years is chronicled in hundreds of heavily-redacted pages released under a lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington over the past several months. The FBIs Video Surveillance Unit took over the agencys <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> program in summer 2010. The Technical Response Unit, another component within the Operational Technology Division, had been overseeing the program since 2003. The FBI flew its first operational <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> mission in October 2006, but documents suggest no operational deployments were flown in the next four years before VSU took over the program. Two months after the handoff, the VSU chief outlined the programs close brush with cancellation and the units bold ambitions for unmanned vehicles. I know [this program] can be a huge benefit to the FBI if given the right support, wrote the VSU chief in a July 2010 email. I wasnt present at a meeting two weeks ago where it was mentioned that folks in this Division was [sic] looking at cutting the UAS program out entirely to meet the budget cuts were facing next year. The VSU chiefs name is redacted throughout the documents. But this LinkedIn profile for a man named Robert Chong indicates he headed the unit through 2012. Chongs profile is endorsed by at least one current FBI supervisory special agent, who also worked at Quantico at the same time as Chong, according to their posted employment histories. The released FBI documents do not indicate what saved the agencys <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s from the budget hangman. But the VSU chiefs vision upon taking up the program was to make it a tool the FBI cannot do without. This would require building demand for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> backup from field agents, as well as drumming up support among senior FBI and Justice Department officials. As it began a new fiscal year, the FBI <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> team set a number of goals to advance the program, which included codifying a process for field offices to request unmanned technical assistance. The Quantico-based team spread word of their wares and protocol to request them by a variety of channels. In a May 2011 newsletter, the VSU boldly declared to agents from coast to coast, The UAV Program is mission ready and fully operational and is actively pursuing additional [Federal Aviation Administration] approvals. The program manager also sent an email in July 2011 to top-ranking agents in hybrid squads along the southwest border and in California, including in Albuquerque, El Paso, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, and San Jose. The time is now here and we are offering these services, the email read, imploring field agents to request unmanned aerial assistance. We have available several small Unmanned Aerial Systems available for deployment. These promotion efforts apparently paid off: the FBI flew at least two <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> missions in 2011, and agency documents indicate that at least six unmanned surveillance operations were approved the same year. One April 2011 mission proposal was rejected in deference to the "safety of nonparticipating aircraft." The final memo noted that even the rejected request was well written even if it could not be authorized. Where fiscal year 2011 was nearly the end of FBI <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, 2012 saw a considerable upswing in budgeted UAV expenditures. Even if its scrubbed of actual figures, a March 2013 email from the Operational Technology Division chief clearly conveys how much more money the program spent in 2012 over the previous year.

The department also made plans to continue to expand aggressively. A July 2012 slideshow looked forward to the not-too-distant FBI UAV Future, when the Bureau would establish an East Coast and West Coast Operational Hub to coordinate <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> missions as well as maintain standalone <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> programs in all major field offices with aviation units. A recruitment email from fall 2012 predicted, Within the next two years the UAV program will double in size and hopefully triple in the amount of requests for UAV deployments.

Such <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>-in-every-pot dreams are hardly reality two years later, and the VSUs enthusiasm was reined in somewhat. In September 2012, for example, an FBI contracts officer refused to allow the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> program manager to play loose with purchase orders after a manufacturer dropped prices. "It's hard to see the money let go, I know, read the contract officers response to the UAV manager, but I cannot violate Federal Appropriations Law." The UAV budget was also cut in fiscal year 2013, presumably derailing the bold visions of expansion ushered in by the programs handoff to the Video Surveillance Unit in 2010. Even with the brakes pumped, though, the FBI managed to spend $3 million on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s from 2004 through May 2013, per figures released by the Justice Department Inspector General last fall. Seemingly paltry next to the FBIs $8.3 billion annual budget, this figure looms much larger given that the Bureau flew a grand total of ten <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> missions in that span, for a rough cost of $300,000 per operational deployment. Even more significant than securing current funding, the FBI <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> teams efforts secured buy-in from field agents and headquarters officials alike, all the way up to the directors office. In February 2013, FBI Director Robert Mueller, III, requested a personal UAV demonstration. Four months later, Mueller confirmed before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the FBI had a small inventory of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, but emphasized that our footprint is very small, we have very few and of limited use. In December 2013, FBI senior leadership were treated to another capability demonstration/briefing which offered attendees the chance to operate a system if they are interested in doing so. In a span of three years, the FBIs <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> program went from budgetary gristle to a matter for the directors attention. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> may not yet be indispensable to the Bureau, but they have generated considerable momentum as a low-cost, low-profile surveillance tool.

                                The FBI has had an eager eye on surveillance <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s since first experimenting with remote control airplanes in 1995. But budget cuts nearly ended the Bureaus unmanned machinations in 2010, and it took a dedicated push aimed at making <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s a tool the FBI cannot do without to cement their place in the FBIs surveillance toolkit. The near termination—and subsequent expansion—of the FBIs <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> program over the past four years is chronicled in hundreds of heavily-redacted pages released under a lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington over the past several months. The FBIs Video Surveillance Unit took over the agencys <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> program in summer 2010. The Technical Response Unit, another component within the Operational Technology Division, had been overseeing the program since 2003. The FBI flew its first operational <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> mission in October 2006, but documents suggest no operational deployments were flown in the next four years before VSU took over the program. Two months after the handoff, the VSU chief outlined the programs close brush with cancellation and the units bold ambitions for unmanned vehicles. I know [this program] can be a huge benefit to the FBI if given the right support, wrote the VSU chief in a July 2010 email. I wasnt present at a meeting two weeks ago where it was mentioned that folks in this Division was [sic] looking at cutting the UAS program out entirely to meet the budget cuts were facing next year. The VSU chiefs name is redacted throughout the documents. But this LinkedIn profile for a man named Robert Chong indicates he headed the unit through 2012. Chongs profile is endorsed by at least one current FBI supervisory special agent, who also worked at Quantico at the same time as Chong, according to their posted employment histories. The released FBI documents do not indicate what saved the agencys <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s from the budget hangman. But the VSU chiefs vision upon taking up the program was to make it a tool the FBI cannot do without. This would require building demand for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> backup from field agents, as well as drumming up support among senior FBI and Justice Department officials. As it began a new fiscal year, the FBI <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> team set a number of goals to advance the program, which included codifying a process for field offices to request unmanned technical assistance. The Quantico-based team spread word of their wares and protocol to request them by a variety of channels. In a May 2011 newsletter, the VSU boldly declared to agents from coast to coast, The UAV Program is mission ready and fully operational and is actively pursuing additional [Federal Aviation Administration] approvals. The program manager also sent an email in July 2011 to top-ranking agents in hybrid squads along the southwest border and in California, including in Albuquerque, El Paso, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, and San Jose. The time is now here and we are offering these services, the email read, imploring field agents to request unmanned aerial assistance. We have available several small Unmanned Aerial Systems available for deployment. These promotion efforts apparently paid off: the FBI flew at least two <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> missions in 2011, and agency documents indicate that at least six unmanned surveillance operations were approved the same year. One April 2011 mission proposal was rejected in deference to the "safety of nonparticipating aircraft." The final memo noted that even the rejected request was well written even if it could not be authorized. Where fiscal year 2011 was nearly the end of FBI <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, 2012 saw a considerable upswing in budgeted UAV expenditures. Even if its scrubbed of actual figures, a March 2013 email from the Operational Technology Division chief clearly conveys how much more money the program spent in 2012 over the previous year. From the FBIs sole redaction slip up, we know that the agency had three small <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s as of December 2010, and the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> team filled out its inventory significantly in 2012.

                                The United States on Thursday told the families of its diplomats in Sierra Leone to leave the country to avoid exposure to the deadly <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic. "The embassy recommended this step out of an abundance of caution," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, citing "a lack of options for routine health care services at major medical facilities due to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak." Harf said that the State Department was also "reconfiguring" its staff at the embassy in Freetown to "be more responsive" to the crisis ravaging the country. "We remain deeply committed to supporting Sierra Leone and regional and international efforts to strengthen the capacity of the country's health care infrastructure and system -- specifically, the capacity to contain and control the transmission of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus and deliver health care," Harf said in a statement.

                                By most accounts, Ferguson, Missouri is wracked by chaos, while many have taken to calling it a police state. At the very least, things are more than a little tense right now, after police shot an killed Mike Brown, an unarmed, 18-year-old black man. Resulting protests have been quashed by force and journalists arrested, with all-important live feeds shut down by the police. Know what would help the country get a handle on what's going on? A <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. Right now, we've been flooded with a deluge of snippets from the media, social media from on the ground, hogwash and analysis from talk radio schmoes, and an overall zoomed-in look on the protests that are occurring right now in Ferguson. This situation is begging for some perspective—on the scale of the protests, on the size.  The police are shooting crowds with rubber bullets, they're arresting journalists and religious figures. Protesters are throwing molotov cocktails at police and police are throwing tear gas canisters and pointing assault weapons right back at them.  The work that journalists and citizens on the ground are doing to show this horrible situation to the world is laudable, but it's not enough. Aerial images could show the scope of the situation, the sheer numbers on each side, the destruction, the smoke, the flames, the police roadblocks in a way that people on the ground simply can't. This is why it's such a huge deal that the Federal Aviation Administration issued a no fly zone over Ferguson earlier this week. The news helicopter might be on its last legs, but it's not dead, and getting them in the sky is crucial to bringing light to the situation.  But, for all the FAA's hemming and hawing about them, small <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s—model aircraft—aren't and haven't been subject to no fly zone restrictions. The FAA has said so itself. Just months after 9/11, the FAA said that "Federal Aviation regulations do not apply to [<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s] …general operating and flight rules do not apply to model aircraft. Model aircraft may operate in controlled airspace without air traffic control authorization, transponders, or altitude reporting equipment." The FAA said Ferguson's no-fly zone was for safety reasons, suggesting that police helicopters had been shot at. But Think Progress reported earlier this week that it wasn't just a safety thing: Its just for a no fly zone because we have multiple helicopters maneuvering in the area and we were having some problems with news aircrafts flying around there, the dispatcher, who identified himself to Think Progress as "Chris," told the publication. Well, at what point does "law enforcement safety" become "police state preservation" or "militarized restriction of Constitutional rights?"  Police in Ferguson have tanks, they have helicopters, they have assault rifles, and other military technology. Journalists are being arrested for the high crime of "trespassing at McDonalds." People are being shot. They're being tear gassed and arrested on their front lawns. Michael Brown is still dead. If <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are going to be used to report the news (and 15 major media companies have formally said that they will be), this is the sort of thing that needs to be covered. The FAA may not like it, the journalist may be arrested, but precedent, and the law, is on the side of the media. While journalists have been arrested for protecting their sources, in Ferguson they're being arrested for reporting the news, which is a mortal blow to the First Amendment. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has reportedly said he'll remove St. Louis PD from Ferguson, but when there is (or at least was) an effective media blackout in place, oversight is fleeting. It's time for someone, anyone, to take the risk, fly a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>, and show the world what's really happening in Ferguson.

                                By most accounts, Ferguson, Missouri is wracked by chaos, while many have taken to calling it a police state. At the very least, things are more than a little tense right now, after police shot an killed Mike Brown, an unarmed, 18-year-old black man. Resulting protests have been quashed by force and journalists arrested, with all-important live feeds shut down by the police. Know what would help the country get a handle on what's going on?

                                Social networks mean that, if we want to, we can be in contact with people almost all of the time. But neuroscientist Beau Lotto at the University College of London argues that existing networks—Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the like—arent actually facilitating human relationships. Far from engaging users with each other, they make us the passive recipients of information. Through his research into human behaviour and perception, Lotto has identified what he considers a fundamental contradiction. Whats fascinating is that [social networks] are not actually geared towards what the brain needs to be social, he said in an interview. They dont facilitate human relationships in the way that theyre used. Instead, they facilitate more of a peacock effect because theyre basically broadcasting mechanisms. Consequently, users are left feeling unattached and disengaged. This research has led him, along with a team of mobile designers at his company <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ripple">Ripple</a></span> Inc, to develop his own messaging app, Traces. The app is a result of what Lotto calls neurodesign: the collaboration of behavioural neuroscience with design, the aim being to enrich the experience of the user by making them an active, rather than passive, participant in social exchange. With Traces, users can leave pieces of music, messages, pictures, and suchlike (traces) out in the real world for a recipient to collect. You leave your trace as an augmented reality droplet in a physical place of your choosing. The recipient then gets notified and the location will appear on their map within the app. Once theyre within 100 metres, theyre able to view the AR droplet imposed on its real-world surroundings. Even closer—50 metres—and they can grab it. Lotto's research into human behaviour and perception influenced the app. One relevant observation from his work was the importance of history in how our brains process information. All information is inherently meaningless; your brain has to create a meaning from it and it does this through the history of experience, he explained. The idea is that when a user of Traces goes to pick up a message they've been sent, they're forced to actively engage with it. Lotto also focuses on the importance of context for the human brain. Using Traces, the sender can choose the site-specific context in which their message is received, thus creating an experience for the receiver that's tethered to a fixed place. Youre now experiencing the message in the real world, so the world becomes the context for the message, he said. The app also draws on research into how the brain develops and maintains relationships, and Lotto gave a nod to research in this area conducted by anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar and his group at Oxford University. Fundamental elements here include shared trust and shared effort, or synchronicity. You have to have mutual engagement, mutual trust, mutual effort—in other words, it needs to be a two-way street, said Lotto.  Image: Traces With Traces, not only does the sender have to put effort into creating the trace; the recipient also has to trust that what they're sending is worthwhile, and put in the effort to actually go and collect it. Research Lotto's team did with the app supported these ideas. They compared two groups receiving the same trace (in this instance, a Nina Simone track), one via Traces and one as an attachment or message. They found that participants who received the music via Traces believed the track was actually better and felt closer to the person who had left it for them. Neurodesigned augmented reality apps wont be making Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter defunct any time soon—these social networks still clearly serve a purpose in situations when instant messaging and broadcasting is required or desired. But Lotto sees it as bridging the gap between the real world and technology. As he sold it, Its one of the first examples where youre able to use digital technology to get people to really engage with the physical world, when digital is typically a barrier to that.

Far from engaging users with each other, they make us the passive recipients of information. Through his research into human behaviour and perception, Lotto has identified what he considers a fundamental contradiction. Whats fascinating is that [social networks] are not actually geared towards what the brain needs to be social, he said in an interview. They dont facilitate human relationships in the way that theyre used. Instead, they facilitate more of a peacock effect because theyre basically broadcasting mechanisms. Consequently, users are left feeling unattached and disengaged. This research has led him, along with a team of mobile designers at his company <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ripple">Ripple</a></span> Inc, to develop his own messaging app, Traces. The app is a result of what Lotto calls neurodesign: the collaboration of behavioural neuroscience with design, the aim being to enrich the experience of the user by making them an active, rather than passive, participant in social exchange. With Traces, users can leave pieces of music, messages, pictures, and suchlike (traces) out in the real world for a recipient to collect. You leave your trace as an augmented reality droplet in a physical place of your choosing. The recipient then gets notified and the location will appear on their map within the app. Once theyre within 100 metres, theyre able to view the AR droplet imposed on its real-world surroundings. Even closer—50 metres—and they can grab it. Lotto's research into human behaviour and perception influenced the app. One relevant observation from his work was the importance of history in how our brains process information. All information is inherently meaningless; your brain has to create a meaning from it and it does this through the history of experience, he explained. The idea is that when a user of Traces goes to pick up a message they've been sent, they're forced to actively engage with it. Lotto also focuses on the importance of context for the human brain. Using Traces, the sender can choose the site-specific context in which their message is received, thus creating an experience for the receiver that's tethered to a fixed place. Youre now experiencing the message in the real world, so the world becomes the context for the message, he said. The app also draws on research into how the brain develops and maintains relationships, and Lotto gave a nod to research in this area conducted by anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar and his group at Oxford University. Fundamental elements here include shared trust and shared effort, or synchronicity. You have to have mutual engagement, mutual trust, mutual effort—in other words, it needs to be a two-way street, said Lotto.  Image: Traces With Traces, not only does the sender have to put effort into creating the trace; the recipient also has to trust that what they're sending is worthwhile, and put in the effort to actually go and collect it. Research Lotto's team did with the app supported these ideas. They compared two groups receiving the same trace (in this instance, a Nina Simone track), one via Traces and one as an attachment or message. They found that participants who received the music via Traces believed the track was actually better and felt closer to the person who had left it for them. Neurodesigned augmented reality apps wont be making Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter defunct any time soon—these social networks still clearly serve a purpose in situations when instant messaging and broadcasting is required or desired. But Lotto sees it as bridging the gap between the real world and technology. As he sold it, Its one of the first examples where youre able to use digital technology to get people to really engage with the physical world, when digital is typically a barrier to that.

                                brindafella (702231) writes Australian scientists have accidentally made one of the most significant discoveries in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cell">stem cell</a></span> research, by studying the transparent embryos of Zebrafish (Danio rerio).

Millions of gallons of a cocktail of water, sand and chemicals are injected into the horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale, releasing the gas—and causing violent protests in Europe and parts of America.Geothermal energy, by contrast, has yet to stir much controversy. Most geothermal plants are located where water has seeped down into the Earth’s crust, been heated and forced back up through permeable rock. Drill a well to between 3,000 and 12,000 feet, and the searing water and steam can be released to drive generators.Geothermal is a minnow among power sources. America has the world’s highest installed capacity of geothermal generating plants—3.4 gigawatts’ worth at last count (see first chart)—but they generate only 0.4% of its electricity (see second chart).

                                Even bears don't mess with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s.John Biehler , CC BY-SA Mini <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are not yet appearing in our skies on a daily basis but they certainly are a rapidly growing trend. People can and do get hurt so we really need to help amateur pilots learn how to fly their new toys safely. There are all kinds of exciting developments happening in this field and hobbyists are now able to pick up a device for relatively little money. But as more and more of these devices come onto the market, more grizzly images are popping up online to show what happens when people lose control. My team and I have been experimenting with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s for some months, flying them over hard-to-reach heritage sites but, as our experience of deploying these platforms has increased, we have become increasingly concerned about how they can be used safely. Many of the promises about what we will use <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s for in the near future are just flights of fancy, especially given the limited payload capabilities of most of commercial off-the-shelf products, but the technology is certainly evolving fast. Out of control? The main limiting factor for a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> is often the untrained pilot at its helm. There have certainly been incidents in the recent past which demonstrate the consequences of human error, system failure, flying in inappropriate weather conditions and sheer incompetence. Earlier this year, a resident of Barrow-in-Furness was prosecuted for flying a radio-controlled aircraft in restricted airspace over BAE Systems’ nuclear submarine facility. A similar incident occurred in May when a man was was questioned by the FBI for crashing a camera-equipped sUAV close to the Bridgeport Harbour Electricity Generating Station in Conneticut. No one was injured in either case but both represented pretty serious incidents in terms of flying within restricted airspace. There have been numerous reports of injuries, even fatalities, caused by loss of control of an sUAV and some pretty harrowing images can easily be found online. Reported cases include a bridegroom who was struck in the face by a quadcopter flown by an adventurous wedding photographer, and the crashing of a hexacopter into the grandstand at Virginia Motorsports Park, injuring five. The second half of 2013 was particularly bad, with fatalities in Texas, Korea and Brazil and the horrendous case of a 19-year-old who died instantly in a Brooklyn park when the blades of his radio controlled aircraft struck his head and neck. Of course, there are rules and guidelines about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s. But when the Civil Aviation Authority tries to address the human factor in its guidelines, its efforts fall rather flat. Its warnings are far too generic and rigid to cope with a rapidly changing technological scene. It discusses the dangers of remote data feedback and stresses that it’s important for pilots to remain situationally aware, but the style of wording and absence of illustrated examples do little to emphasise the very real dangers of flying when non-expert pilots are in charge of a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. Having now experimented with a number of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s at historical sites, often in remote moorland or coastal regions, I find myself in strong agreement with those who call for regulations to be strengthened. Indeed, we have recently produced our own Standard Operating Procedures in an attempt to fill in the gaps evident in existing guidance. Careful now. Over the past 12 months alone, our hexacopter has evolved from a 2kg to 4kg payload capacity. Our students have, as a result, been able to experiment with different tools for the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s. One has been a camera that feeds video back to a headed mounted display worn by the pilot on the ground. This certainly generates impressive video but even our experienced pilot has been “drawn in” by the stunning picture quality, only to be alerted – just in time – to the appearance of the sUAV propeller blades in his field of view as the vehicle becomes progressively unstable. Flying school It is possible to take training courses for flying <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s but these often tend to be aimed at those wanting to use sUAVs for professional or commercial work, as opposed to the hobbyist or academic researcher. It is clear that, as the stories of injuries, fatalities, property damage, invasion of privacy, trespass and airspace incursion multiply, the situation has to change, even though any change will, without doubt, be very unpopular with many hobbyists and retailers. Some developers have started working on firmware modifications that would help pilots stop their <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s from inadvertently flying into restricted airspace. This is a promising development, even if it might not be met with great enthusiasm from users, but much more needs to be done. Every <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> sold needs to be registered and marked (perhaps even chipped) in some way so that it can be traced directly back to its owner if something goes wrong. There is no doubt that this will be difficult to enforce, especially as 3D printing technologies are increasingly being used to manufacture replacement components. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drone">Drone</a></span> pilots also need to submit to some form of basic competence assessment, such as through an app, and should then be granted a licence. Such an assessment could take the form of a test similar to those used to teach driving students about decision-making and observational skills. sUAV simulator packages already exist, as do apps, but most fall short of teaching and evaluating the essential skills and awareness necessary for safe sUAV operations. We should focus on human-centred design issues from the start so that simulators can test reaction times, decision-making for flights in urban or sensitive areas, pilot distraction effects and other potential problems a pilot might face. Of course, such tests would not replace professional courses but they would help to ensure that the growing number of pilots can fly their devices safely. Some might complain that these measures are over the top and totally unnecessary for something that is, after all, just a smaller version of a radio controlled helicopter. But just type “quadcopter injuries” into Google images and make your own mind up.

                                The news: Civil unrest in response to the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has received the lion's share of media coverage. But as protests continue, the authorities' response has increasingly looked less like police action and more like a crackdown in a war zone. This is partially because American police forces are now equipped to operate in war zones. As U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have gradually come down, military equipment — armored personnel carriers, weapons, tactical uniforms and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> — have become available to virtually every local police force across the country.

                                Carol Ann Duffy with the Queen.Gareth Fuller/PA Archive Poetry for the Palace, an exhibition at Edinburgh’s Holyrood House, has been timed (its website proclaims) to mark the halfway point of Carol Ann Duffy’s laureateship. The exhibition places the openly gay Mancunian – the first woman to be recognised in the post’s 400-year history – in uncomfortable company: Dryden, Tennyson, Alfred Austin, John Betjeman, for heaven’s sake. A less clubbable, less appealing literary gathering I can scarcely imagine. But that’s the accolade’s weird elitism for you. Cherishing the freedom of creative expression as energetically as she does, I’ve never understood how the sharp-eyed, supple-tongued Duffy could countenance joining our oh-so-21st-century Royal Household. She accepted, she said at the time, “purely because they hadn’t had a woman … I look on it as recognition of the great women poets we now have writing”. It’s laudable logic; the exhibition endorses her, after all. A public platform If it grates, the Laureate’s title commemorates poetry’s age-old cultural-political punch. The leafy symbols of ancient imperial power confirm the political value of creative expression from time immemorial. Emperors, kings; most kinds of decision-makers kept their poets – often also musicians – close at hand, to record and represent deeds and decisions, in and outside the court, much as a PR office does today. A medieval variant on the Twitter feed. Patronage brings influence but, for articulate sorts inclined to truth-telling, courtly life always had its risks. It was poets that Plato wanted to ban from his Republic. This is because, as any decent poet knows, you can’t tell good poems what to do. Language is always as capable of toxicity as magic. By definition, the Laureateship makes its holder visible. The post brings with it publicity otherwise impossible to generate. Duffy and her predecessor Andrew Motion have proved that a platform conventionally deployed to laud Royal goings-on – even (albeit unhappily) by as independent-minded a writer as the late Ted Hughes – can be put to more useful ends. It was Motion who arranged, on his own appointment in 1999, to remake a life-long role into a ten-year post, with an annual stipend of £5,000. He went on to distance himself from the “court” in the course of his tenure (which, famously, he said induced writer’s block) by writing for the TUC, the Salvation Army, Childline and Combat Stress; he also protested against the invasion of Iraq in 2003. If there were dutiful offerings for the Windsor family album along the way, we also have Motion to thank for the founding and funding of that online treasure-chest, the Poetry Archive. Duffy marked her own appointment by using her honorarium to inaugurate a new poetry prize. Topics to catch her eye have included parliamentary expenses, Afghanistan, the banking crisis and the Icelandic dust-cloud. Vigil commemorates LGBT victims of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>. Insisting that nobody has ever told her what to write, Duffy has produced the odd occasional poem: The Crown marks the 60th anniversary of the Coronation; Rings, co-authored with textual artist Stephen Raw, the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. Interestingly, the birth of their son met with silence. More recently, Duffy’s anti-establishment leanings were bitingly confirmed in 22 Reasons for the Bedroom Tax. Poet as outsider The fact is, poets don’t make good insiders. Of any establishment. Why don’t we re-engineer, and rename, this imperialist leftover? It’s not only the ridiculous title, with its cap-doffing associates (Master of the Queen’s Music, Master of the Horse, Astronomer Royal). It’s also the invidiousness of the post: much as I love poetry, where are the Artist, Novelist or Dramatist Laureates? More specifically, why merely one voice, among so many deserving ones? But above all the Laureateship undermines creative independence. Threatens that counter-cultural heritage which is above all the poet’s special legacy: the ability to speak truth, at unwelcome times or in inhospitable places, to power. Besides a plainly dispensable stipend, to a reader like me that benighted title will always condemn, in a single word, as much as it enfranchises. A shorter period of tenure would help. A life, even a decade, is an inflexibly long time. The Scots Makar, Scotland’s National Poet, is a five-year post; Wales’ National Poet should enjoy no more than a year (although Gillian Clarke has been in post since 2008, without mention of replacement). Despite the exemplary contrariness of Duffy’s Laureateship, I’m not sure I’ll ever know how to compute “Poet Laureate”, whatever the incumbent’s gender. If it gets poetry more limelight, there are surely less strange, less compromising ways of affording its finest practitioners, women or men, the cultural recognition they deserve.

                                He might not be faking it - but he is acting.Obama for America, CC BY-NC-SA When Hillary Clinton welled up in response to an innocuous question about how she keeps so upbeat on the presidential campaign trail in 2008, people took notice. To the surprise of pollsters, she won the primary in question – <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> – despite trailing her opponent Barack Obama before the tears. A display of weaknesses such as this is one of the most fundamental qualities of inspirational leadership. Expressing sincere vulnerability allows leaders to communicate their humanity and accessibility, and it seems the people of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> were swayed. Such communication is also at the heart of acting. The best actors inhabit their roles to the point where the boundaries between character and reality blur and they are no longer “faking it”. Hillary wasn’t faking it either – no doubt she really does find the stresses of the campaign trail a lot to deal with, and the unusual question threw her off balance. She wasn’t lying; but she was acting. So what can leaders – politicians, CEOs or even headteachers – learn from actors? What Warren saw Warren Bennis, who died recently at age 89, thought about this question more than anyone. Bennis was considered the father of leadership studies and his thinking focused on the premise that leadership is not an innate quality, but rather a set of skills that can be developed. He also made a clear distinction between management and leadership, arguing that the role of the manager is “to plan, organise and coordinate,” whereas the role of the leader is “to inspire and motivate”. One of Bennis’ ideas which has been largely overlooked in leadership studies is the connection he established between leadership and acting. Bennis argued that leaders, like actors, have to perform a role in order to inspire others. They have to engage followers by creating shared meaning. “Hitler is a ghastly example of this ability, and a reminder of the under-appreciated role that rhetoric and performance play in leadership,” Bennis once noted. For Bennis, as for many other leadership thinkers, inspiration is at the core of the leadership process. The inspirational element is what makes leadership and acting quite similar. The actor inspires an audience in the same way the leader inspires followers. According to Bennis, “like great actors, great leaders create and sell an alternative vision of the world, a better one in which we are an essential part.” The truth within The paradox of acting is that actors portray fictional characters, but must find the truth of their characters within themselves. It is not about faking being someone, but rather about being someone truthfully. Actors draw on their own lives to produce authentic performances, finding characteristics and experiences in themselves that can be related to the realities of their characters. A future president looks forward to his next role. Ronald Reagan Library Leaders, like actors, must strive to find themselves truthfully in their leadership roles. Self-awareness and authenticity become critical in the leadership process. Leaders must look for values and beliefs in their own lives that correspond to the leadership situation in which they find themselves. They should make their values and beliefs explicit in order to share them with their followers. The authenticity related to sharing their own values and beliefs will inspire their followers the same way actors’ authentic performances inspire audiences. Authentic emotions The morning after President Obama was re-elected in 2012, he gave a short but emotive speech at his Chicago headquarters, thanking his young volunteers for their hard work. After recalling how much he had matured as a community organiser in Chicago when he was younger, and how much the young supporters reminded him of himself, his voice cracked and he started shedding tears. This emotional moment was followed by a loud ovation from his young followers. It was the expression of authentic emotions which made Obama’s brief speech compelling and inspirational. Skip to 3:25 if you’ve heard the life story before. Acting training generally consists of developing internal and external elements. Actors spend hours working on their own memories, senses, and emotions to be able to produce authentic performances. They train their bodies, and work on their breathing, movements, voice, and speech to improve their stage presence. This combination of internal and external elements, of authenticity and presence, makes their performances inspirational. Like actors, leaders must learn how to strike the right balance between presence and authenticity. Leadership development, like acting training, should focus on developing both internal and external qualities that will allow leaders to inspire and motivate followers. The benefits of acting training in leadership development are based on the premise that acting and leadership can be seen as two sides of the same coin. As Bennis once noted, “they are unavoidably yoked together, these two, by a common social purpose: the creation of mutuality, of transforming feeling into shared meaning.” Marco Aponte-Moreno does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.

And with the most distant parts of the world less than a day’s flight away, it isn’t too difficult to imagine <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus spreading. If someone infected with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus vomits, bleeds or has diarrhoea on a flight, there is an opportunity to transmit the infection to others on the plane. Air travel has already introduced <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus into Nigeria’s bustling metropolis of Lagos. The sick passenger died in Lagos at the end of July but the infection had already spread to nine other people. Some countries, such as the Ivory Coast and Saudi Arabia have banned incoming flights from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>-affected countries. Other countries may follow. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend a general ban on travel to countries not affected by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>. But ease of access to air travel means all countries, including Australia, need to be vigilant for possible imported cases. The illness Knowing the incubation period of an infectious illness is important to determine if it is safe to bring a suspected case out of quarantine. The incubation period of an infection refers to the time interval between becoming infected and becoming sick. Some infections have an incubation period of only a few days while others can last for years, such as tuberculosis. For <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus infection, the incubation period is between two and 21 days. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus infection has a fearsome reputation among the general population for quickly causing uncontrolled and ubiquitous bleeding. But while this can occur, infection usually begins as a flu-like illness with fevers, muscle aches and generally feeling lousy. Australians with seasonal influenza would report similar symptoms. In West Africa, malaria presents in this way. If health-care workers didn’t know there was an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus outbreak going on, they would almost certainly attribute these symptoms to another illness. As the infection progresses, people can develop a variety of symptoms ranging from diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, a cough, breathing difficulties, red eyes and swelling. Around day five of illness, a rash may appear. People who recover tend to improve six to 11 days into the illness. In the current outbreak, this happens around 45% of the time (1,848 cases and 1,013 deaths as of August 9), which is higher than previous outbreaks. For the other 55% of cases, however, the organs and blood clotting system of the body shut down as an irreversible decline sets in, leading to death. The infectiousness of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus In infections such as influenza, cases may be infectious to other people before they feel unwell. People with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus infection, on the other hand, are only infectious after becoming sick. This makes it just a little easier for health authorities to limit transmission. In the current outbreak in West Africa, human-to-human transmission is responsible for the ongoing epidemic. Contact with infected body fluids through broken skin or mucous membranes (e.g. the eyes and mouth) can transmit the virus to others. This even applies to dead bodies, which makes funerals potentially dangerous. Liberian nurses are taking extra precautions when transporting the bodies of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> victims. EPA/Ahmed Jallanzo No definite human-to-human transmission has been demonstrated through breathing, unlike infections such as measles, chicken pox and influenza. But a study in animals suggested that the Zaire strain of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus could be transmitted from pigs to monkeys through air. The significance of this for human-to-human transmission isn’t clear. International response With one billion people travelling overseas each year, it’s never been easier for an infection in one part of the world to reach another. The WHO last week announced that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak met the conditions for a “public health emergency of international concern” and recommended countries with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> check everyone leaving the country for possible infection. This is called “exit screening” and involves measures such as questionnaires, information sheets and measuring the temperature with thermal scanners. In countries that don’t have <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, the WHO stated there should be “no general ban on international travel or trade” to those countries with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>. It also recommended all countries have the capacity to identify and deal with travellers coming back with a fever from a nation with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>. This is called “entry screening” and often involves the same strategies used in the “exit screening”. During the SARS outbreak, however, both exit and entry screening strategies failed to detect many cases. The virus spread from Asia to various parts of the world, especially to Canada. There may not have been many cases of SARS among travellers to explain its limited detection on airport screening. But there were other possibilities too that can be applied to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus as well as SARS. Some infected people may be in the incubation period so they genuinely aren’t sick at the time of the trip. Alternatively, some people might be sick but would not declare their illness for fear of quarantine. They may have evaded the thermal scanners by taking medication to hide their fever. Others with the illness may naturally not have had a fever at the time of thermal scanning. But despite the limited detection rate of the airport screening process during the SARS outbreak, it was still thought to be a useful way to educate incoming travellers about what to do and where to go if they became sick.

Pre-clinical studies of these cells by Ciacci and Martin Marsala, MD, at the UC San Diego School of Medicine, showed that these grafted neural <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cell">stem cell</a></span>s improved motor function in spinal cord injured rats with minimal side effects indicating that human clinical trials are now warranted. <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                Like in the United States, Canada's regulatory agencies are struggling with what to do about the proliferation of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s. In fact, Transport Canada has noted at least 12 unsafe instances since 2011 involving Unmanned aerial vehicles, according to documents obtained under the Access to Information Act by Motherboard. Besides detailing the difficulties regulating the sudden emergence of quadcopters, the documents also reveal a series of near misses with passenger and small manned aircraft. Take for example a July 2013 incident where a WestJet pilot allegedly spotted a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> dangerously buzzing around his aircraft as he landed at a Vancouver airport. Or just before that, in May 2013, when a Cessna pilot flying out of Oshawa, Ontario saw a red and white remote controlled airplane fly 100 feet below him as he flew his plane. Both incidents highlighted just how easy it is to fly your average quadcopter near a larger aircraft carrying human beings, a problem that Canadian airspace regulators hadn't seen prior to the emergence of cheap, ready-to-fly quadcopters. Under current Canadian Aviation Regulations (CAR), anybody operating a model aircraft or <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> weighing more than 35 kilograms for non-recreative purposes, has to obtain a Special Flight Operation Certificate (SFOC) from Transport Canada.  But that means that anything under 35 kilograms is fair game to be flown by hobbyists without many limitations or licenses, making it tough for the agency to track those unlicensed users. But that hasnt stopped some <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> operators from using their <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in ways the agency isn't cool with. One incident found in the Access documents details an incident in which an aerial photographer allegedly used his <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> to take pictures of his neighbour sunbathing. To be fair, several of these "spying" incidents have been debunked in the United States over the last year or so, and these documents show only the government's side of things. In the document, a Transport Canada official explained that the agency's hands were tied by the law: I advised her there is nothing we can do, wrote the investigator, this will have to be a police issue. In seven out of 12 cases listed in the documents obtained by Motherboard, the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> pilots did not have a valid SFOC (though it's likely that most of the pilots wouldn't actually need one).  In those cases, the agency either dismissed the case or recommended "oral counseling." In the United States, meanwhile, the FAA often sends out cease-and-desist orders or hefty fines. That's not to say that Transport Canada isn't concerned. The agency desperately tried to track down a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> operator who flew his aircraft too close to an Air Canada plane landing at Vancouver International Airport in March 2013. The crew of AC008 estimated that the RC help came within 100 feet of their aircraft and that it was such a size that their initial reaction was that it was a real, the Transport Canada investigator wrote. RCMP officers were dispatched to the scene, but werent able to locate the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> pilot. Nav Canada, a not-for-profit corporation in charge of managing Canadas civilian airspace, wasnt able to find any leads on the operator, either. That led a Transport Canada investigator to ask for information about the event on a radio-controlled airplane forum. That incident prompted Transport Canada to change its approach policing personal UAVs. As I understand it, the new protocol is to treat these like laser attacks and dispatch the RCMP immediately, the investigator continued, noting it would be difficult to find the culprit in the future. The RCMP has since identified the individual responsible for the March 2013 incident, according to the Richmond, British Columbia, RCMP detachment. Thats probably thanks to a video the alleged pilot uploaded to Youtube. Even so, the operator has yet to be interviewed and no charges have been filed. What people are not understanding is that, just because (the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>) is not in the flight path, that doesn't mean there aren't other aircrafts operating in the airspace, Sgt. Cam Kowalski, an officer with the Richmond RCMP Department, told me. It wasnt a problem until very recently… but (<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s) are becoming very cheap and powerful. And because the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are small and fly relatively low, theyre not picked up by Nav Canadas radars. Most are also not equipped with transponders, the device used by planes to signal to each other, and to ground station, its location and altitude. Despite facing problems tracking <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, Transport Canada is staying ahead of the curve says Trevor Bergmann, president of the Halifax-based aerial photo company AeroVision. Theyre far ahead from where the US is in terms of, FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) regulations, especially when it comes to doling out commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> licenses, he said in an interview with Motherboard.  The FAA has drastically restricted the use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s for commercial purposes. Last month, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> enthusiasts even started fighting the FAA rules, calling them at best ill-conceived and at worst intentionally punitive and retaliatory. Bergmann contacted Transport Canada last March, complaining about other small businesses in the Halifax area that were operating without an SFOC. There seems to be a growing misconception and some very creative views on the regulations in this market, he wrote in his complaint to the feds. According to Bergmann, there are <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> operators out there, using aircraft for non-recreational purposes, a clear violation of the CAR, if they dont possess adequate licensing, regardless of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> size. With an ever expanding <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> market, some models set to be the size of hummingbirds, there's not much the Canadian feds can do but crackdown on users they catch in the act. In other words, they'll continue prowling YouTube <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> videos and scouting online chat forums for informants.

                                Like in the United States, Canada's regulatory agencies are struggling with what to do about the proliferation of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s. In fact, Transport Canada has noted at least 12 unsafe instances since 2011 involving Unmanned aerial vehicles, according to documents obtained under the Access to Information Act by Motherboard. Besides detailing the difficulties regulating the sudden emergence of quadcopters, the documents also reveal a series of near misses with passenger and small manned aircraft. Take for example a July 2013 incident where a WestJet pilot allegedly spotted a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> dangerously buzzing around his aircraft as he landed at a Vancouver airport. Or just before that, in May 2013, when a Cessna pilot flying out of Oshawa, Ontario saw a red and white remote controlled airplane fly 100 feet below him as he flew his plane. Both incidents highlighted just how easy it is to fly your average quadcopter near a larger aircraft carrying human beings, a problem that Canadian airspace regulators hadn't seen prior to the emergence of cheap, ready-to-fly quadcopters. Under current Canadian Aviation Regulations (CAR), anybody operating a model aircraft or <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> weighing more than 35 kilograms for non-recreative purposes, has to obtain a Special Flight Operation Certificate (SFOC) from Transport Canada.  But that means that anything under 35 kilograms is fair game to be flown by hobbyists without many limitations or licenses, making it tough for the agency to track those unlicensed users. But that hasnt stopped some <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> operators from using their <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in ways the agency isn't cool with. One incident found in the Access documents details an incident in which an aerial photographer allegedly used his <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> to take pictures of his neighbour sunbathing. To be fair, several of these "spying" incidents have been debunked in the United States over the last year or so, and these documents show only the government's side of things. In the document, a Transport Canada official explained that the agency's hands were tied by the law: I advised her there is nothing we can do, wrote the investigator, this will have to be a police issue. In seven out of 12 cases listed in the documents obtained by Motherboard, the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> pilots did not have a valid SFOC (though it's likely that most of the pilots wouldn't actually need one).  In those cases, the agency either dismissed the case or recommended "oral counseling." In the United States, meanwhile, the FAA often sends out cease-and-desist orders or hefty fines. That's not to say that Transport Canada isn't concerned. The agency desperately tried to track down a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> operator who flew his aircraft too close to an Air Canada plane landing at Vancouver International Airport in March 2013. The crew of AC008 estimated that the RC help came within 100 feet of their aircraft and that it was such a size that their initial reaction was that it was a real, the Transport Canada investigator wrote. RCMP officers were dispatched to the scene, but werent able to locate the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> pilot. Nav Canada, a not-for-profit corporation in charge of managing Canadas civilian airspace, wasnt able to find any leads on the operator, either. That led a Transport Canada investigator to ask for information about the event on a radio-controlled airplane forum. That incident prompted Transport Canada to change its approach policing personal UAVs. As I understand it, the new protocol is to treat these like laser attacks and dispatch the RCMP immediately, the investigator continued, noting it would be difficult to find the culprit in the future. The RCMP has since identified the individual responsible for the March 2013 incident, according to the Richmond, British Columbia, RCMP detachment. Thats probably thanks to a video the alleged pilot uploaded to Youtube. Even so, the operator has yet to be interviewed and no charges have been filed. What people are not understanding is that, just because (the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>) is not in the flight path, that doesn't mean there aren't other aircrafts operating in the airspace, Sgt. Cam Kowalski, an officer with the Richmond RCMP Department, told me. It wasnt a problem until very recently… but (<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s) are becoming very cheap and powerful. And because the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are small and fly relatively low, theyre not picked up by Nav Canadas radars. Most are also not equipped with transponders, the device used by planes to signal to each other, and to ground station, its location and altitude. Despite facing problems tracking <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, Transport Canada is staying ahead of the curve says Trevor Bergmann, president of the Halifax-based aerial photo company AeroVision. Theyre far ahead from where the US is in terms of, FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) regulations, especially when it comes to doling out commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> licenses, he said in an interview with Motherboard.  The FAA has drastically restricted the use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s for commercial purposes. Last month, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> enthusiasts even started fighting the FAA rules, calling them at best ill-conceived and at worst intentionally punitive and retaliatory. Bergmann contacted Transport Canada last March, complaining about other small businesses in the Halifax area that were operating without an SFOC. There seems to be a growing misconception and some very creative views on the regulations in this market, he wrote in his complaint to the feds. According to Bergmann, there are <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> operators out there, using aircraft for non-recreational purposes, a clear violation of the CAR, if they dont possess adequate licensing, regardless of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> size. With an ever expanding <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> market, some models set to be the size of hummingbirds, there's not much the Canadian feds can do but crackdown on users they catch in the act. In other words, they'll continue prowling YouTube <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> videos and scouting online chat forums for informants.
