                                By Eric Telmor and Emma Farge BOYA Liberia/DAKAR (Reuters) - To try to control the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic spreading through West Africa, Liberia has quarantined remote villages at the epicenter of the virus, evoking the "plague villages" of medieval Europe that were shut off from the outside world. With few food and medical supplies getting in, many abandoned villagers face a stark choice: stay where they are and risk death or skip quarantine, spreading the infection further in a country ill-equipped to cope. In Boya, in northern Liberia's Lofa County, Joseph Gbembo, who caught <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> and survived, says he is struggling to raise 10 children under five years old and support five widows after nine members of his family were killed by the virus.

                                By Eric Telmor and Emma Farge BOYA Liberia/DAKAR (Reuters) - To try to control the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic spreading through West Africa, Liberia has quarantined remote villages at the epicenter of the virus, evoking the "plague villages" of medieval Europe that were shut off from the outside world. With few food and medical supplies getting in, many abandoned villagers face a stark choice: stay where they are and risk death or skip quarantine, spreading the infection further in a country ill-equipped to cope. In Boya, in northern Liberia's Lofa County, Joseph Gbembo, who caught <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> and survived, says he is struggling to raise 10 children under five years old and support five widows after nine members of his family were killed by the virus. "Nobody will talk to me and people run away from me." He says he has received no food or health care for the children and no help from government officials.

                                In the gaming world, "roguelikes" are role-playing video games featuring tile-based mechanics and turn-based gameplay. Typically occupying the space of high fantasy, they seek to explore the labyrinths of the mind. But a new game created by UK-based designer Niall Moody (So Many Jagged Shards, Explosive Transcendental Circulatory System) seeks to turn the roguelike on its head, subverting it into an audio-visual alternate reality where users might hack their way into an entirely new version of the game. Moody's high-concept roguelike variation began as an attempt to build an abstract set of glyphs for his already in-development [encrypted]. (Glyphs in roguelikes are typically characters set against colorful foreground and backgrounds.) What was intended to be a month-long project grew into something much bigger and experimental.  "[encrypted] was originally born out of a conversation with Jonathan Brodsky of Lucky Frame," Moody told me. "We were talking about roguelikes, and how their turn-based nature encourages the designer to focus on the game's systems, and the ways they interact with each other." Instead of concentrating on roguelike gameplay, Moody wanted to fixate on the game's visual aesthetic with ASCII graphics. The fantasy roguelike Brogue, which has players descend into a subterranean dungeon to retrieve an amulet, proved a formative influence. But, Moody wanted to bring something new to roguelikes, while still harkening back to the genre's indie ancestry.  Moody also noted that [encrypted] isn't actually the game's proper title. The game's real name is contained in the four big glyphs on the title screen. So, [encrypted], he said, should also be described as an Alternative Reality Game (ARG). That is, all text in the game, including the title screen and the message display below the main game display, is encrypted English text.  Moody said it's possible to decrypt this text and discover an entirely different aspect of the game. Right now everything needs to be decrypted manually, but for the game's final release, Moody will add "hooks" so that players can code their own decrypter, making the game decrypt itself on the fly. "At the moment, you'd have to decrypt everything manually, which would be fairly masochistic," he said.  As Moody noted, the game borrows heavily from Michael Brough's Zaga-33and 868-Hack, as well as Lucky Frame's Nightmare Cooperative. What Moody likes about this particular lineage of roguelikes is the way they simplify and streamline the game mechanics in comparison to more traditional excursions into the genre.  "Typically, roguelikes have a lot of systems and numbers to keep track of: stats, status effects, XP/leveling, inventories, pets/allies, etc.," Moody explained, "and that's great, but it can make for some incredibly deep games with all sorts of fascinating strategies for the player. From a developer's perspective, though, creating a game like that is an enormous amount of work. There's a reason most of the big roguelikes have been in development for decades." With [encrypted], Moody wanted to create a Brough-like game with fewer systems, one designed specifically to generate interesting interactions. He didn't want any text (English), aiming instead for abstraction, while still allowing players to intuit what is happening. As a result, [encrypted] will allow players to see that each enemy has a particular way of moving, or a specific action to perform. And, after a few plays, Moody said that gamers should be able to predict what will happen on any given turn.  What's also really interesting about [encrypted]] is that it deploys experimental audio alongside the abstract visuals. There are two parts to the game's audio. In the first part, the sound itself is entirely generated by the game, using a collection of synthesizer and audio effects algorithms. In a video Moody posted of his work on this "procedural audio," the sound and visuals "smear" and distort in almost psychedelic fashion.  Moody said that the game incorporates two subtractive synthesizers (where low-pass filters alter the signals' timbre), as well as kick drum, clap, and hi-hat synthesizers. These synths are then run through a sequence of audio effects including two granulators, one delay, a bank of eight tuned comb filters, one distortion, and one combined bit crusher and sample-rate reducer (toggled for explosions). This will result, as Moody described it, in a very dense, distorted sound, with a lot of interesting overtones and resonances. The other part of the game's audio can be found in how the synthesizers are triggered. [encrypted] uses a small collection of simple algorithms to determine when to trigger each synth. This is carried out on a bar-by-bar basis, so each synth has an associated step sequencer, and the game periodically writes new patterns into that sequencer.  "The one exception is the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> (subtractive) synthesizer," said Moody, "which has the same pattern throughout the game in order to sustain its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. Essentially, all the audio in the game is generated entirely from code; there are no samples, and no precomposed musical passages." Moody explained that this means that, when listened to as a standalone piece of music, the audio would not work particularly well. But, in the context of the game, it adds to the game's mesmerizing tension.  "The game does a lot to put pressure on the player, with the constant enemy attacks and environmental hazards forcing them onwards," he said. "And this particular combination of synthesizers and effects and procedural patterns seems to really heighten that pressure." As far as gameplay is concerned, [encrypted] mostly follows the usual roguelike mechanics. It's turn-based, and players can attack the enemies by bumping into them. This form of attack is, as Moody explained, a dangerous proposition, so picking battles carefully will be a big part of the game. And each enemy has a unique ability which players can collect and use themselves after the enemy is vanquished. The ultimate goal is to stay alive as long as possible. Moody is hoping for a September release date, but said that could be a bit optimistic. His progress can nonetheless by charted at Make Game.

                                The Ice Bucket Challenge is well on its way to raising plenty of money for ALS research — and it's leaving no tech exec dry. Tesla CEO and billionaire inventor <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> took his turn taking a cool, refreshing ice-water bath today. Musk's five boys, Griffin, Xavier, Damian, Saxon, and Kai got a good laugh out of dousing their father, though the contraption isn't quite as impressive as Bill Gates' over-engineered rig. Musk is apparently under the weather, though, so maybe he wasn't quite up to the task of one-upping the Microsoft co-founder. Gates challenged Musk yesterday, and now Musk is passing the torch on to Johnny Depp, Tony Hawk, and Minecraft creator Notch. <span class='elision'>Continue reading…</span>

                                For those who still imagine the supplement industry as some benevolent alternative to Big Pharma, behold: American vitamin peddlers are being warned against making continued claims of their products' efficacy in treating/curing the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. These warnings come courtesy of the United States' FDA and the WHO and, so far, are only warnings, with the promise of real-life penalties if firms continue pushing dishonest and dangerous marketing campaigns. "Unfortunately, during outbreak situations, fraudulent products that claim to prevent, treat, or cure a disease all too often appear on the market," the FDA warming reads. "By law, dietary supplements cannot claim to prevent or cure disease." Of particular concern is a product called NanoSilver, sold by the Natural Solutions Foundation. The product is basically a solution of tiny silver particles, and purports to be something of a cure-all for infections of any stripe. Silver has demonstrated antimicrobal properties and, in the hands of the supplement industry, this can only mean that it treats whatever disease is handy. And while indeed silver is effective in surface antibiotic applications—as a disinfectant coating for medical devices, or a antimicrobal protectant utilized around public spaces—it is also fairly toxic to humans. And despite the howling chorus of natural heath boosters (just Google "silver particles cure") the concept hasn't really been shown to cure or treat anything once it's inside the human body. Nonetheless, Rima E. Laibow, Natural Solutions Foundation's "medical director," sent a letter to a bunch of African health officials. "There is good reason to believe that there already is a natural solution for, and prevention against, the terrifying novel <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus for which, at this point, no effective treatment or counter measures are thought to exist," she wrote.

It stuck in at least one crucial place. The New York Times reports: Nigerias health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, said an unidentified Nigerian scientist living overseas had arranged for Nigeria to get a different experimental medicine, according to Nigerian news outlets. They identified it as NanoSilver, a supplement offered by the Natural Solutions Foundation, which said that it contains microscopic silver particles, although, as a food supplement, it is not tested by regulatory agencies. Silver kills some microbes on surfaces and in wounds, but it can be toxic and is not F.D.A.-approved for systemic use against viruses. After the Times attempted to contact Laibow about her products' claims, a pair of NanoSilver-boosting websites went dark, featuring redirects to a different product called Silver Solution. At least one other supplement is boosting anti-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> properties, Monolaurin, and a rumor is spreading that drinking salt water will do the trick, to dangerous effect. At least two Nigerians have died from downing large amounts of salt. The whole thing has echos of the too-often forgotten Matthias Rath reign of quackery in South Africa in the mid-00s. Rath had been an outspoken antagonist of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> suppression therapies, convincing many that antiretriviral therapies are themselves toxic, a destructive weapon against humans wielded by a malevolent pharma industry. He had an alternative in mind, of course: vitamins. With significant aid from the South African government, Rath conducted a propaganda campaign with the aim of convincing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-positive patients to give up their medications and join his study, where they would be taking vitamins instead. Many thousands of people did, and a great many of them likely died as a direct result. The whole episode was nothing short of monstrous and Rath was eventually barred from continuing his "research" and from making any more bogus claims. It's worth reading Ben Goldacre's account of the episode—and Rath's attempts to silence that account—for the Guardian, which also released a short documentary on the whole horrific mess. (Beware: it's a fully skin-crawling experience.) Unfortunately, unlike Rath's war on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> medication, there is no <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> treatment to go to war against. It's much easier to talk fearful people into something when the alternative is nothing. The Raths of the world might even view the current situation as ideal, an open doorway for spreading junk medicine on poorly educated populations at their most vulnerable.

                                For those who still imagine the supplement industry as some benevolent alternative to Big Pharma, behold: American vitamin peddlers are being warned against making continued claims of their products' efficacy in treating/curing the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. These warnings come courtesy of the United States' FDA and the WHO and, so far, are only warnings, with the promise of real-life penalties if firms continue pushing dishonest and dangerous marketing campaigns. "Unfortunately, during outbreak situations, fraudulent products that claim to prevent, treat, or cure a disease all too often appear on the market," the FDA warming reads. "By law, dietary supplements cannot claim to prevent or cure disease." Of particular concern is a product called NanoSilver, sold by the Natural Solutions Foundation. The product is basically a solution of tiny silver particles, and purports to be something of a cure-all for infections of any stripe. Silver has demonstrated antimicrobal properties and, in the hands of the supplement industry, this can only mean that it treats whatever disease is handy. And while indeed silver is effective in surface antibiotic applications—as a disinfectant coating for medical devices, or a antimicrobal protectant utilized around public spaces—it is also fairly toxic to humans. And despite the howling chorus of natural heath boosters (just Google "silver particles cure") the concept hasn't really been shown to cure or treat anything once it's inside the human body. Nonetheless, Rima E. Laibow, Natural Solutions Foundation's "medical director," sent a letter to a bunch of African health officials.

                                You won't believe dramatic new portrayal of Silk Road... but you should. Johan.V./Flickr, CC BY Alex Oates' debut Fringe play traces the journey of 19-year-old Geordie lad Bruce, as he begins dealing cocaine via the illicit online marketplace Silk Road. Under the guise of a coming of age drama, the play – also entitled Silk Road – sets out to explore some of the issues surrounding the online trade in illegal drugs. As well as having the novelty of being the first play funded by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, experts confirm that Oates' depiction of Silk Road is substantially accurate. In plain terms, the now defunct Silk Road was an international crypto-market – an encrypted, eBay-style marketplace, accessible to anyone with an internet connection, but located beyond the reach of conventional search engines like Google. Silk Road users around the world could anonymously buy and sell illegal drugs, and other black market items, using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. Goods sold on this crypto-market were typically dispatched via conventional mail, and sellers were subject to customer feedback, much like on Amazon. A battle for legitimacy Oates' depiction of the Silk Road community is quietly positive. The playwright explained that as part of his research, he downloaded Tor – a browser which allows users to access the deep web anonymously – and created an account on Silk Road. His impression was of a nice, welcoming, and helpful group of people. Oates said: “I think because they have such a firm political ideology behind them, they want to create a good impression.” Given the negative impacts associated with the consumption, trafficking, and dealing of illegal drugs, audiences could be forgiven for feeling sceptical about Oates' portrayal of ideologically motivated, anonymous drugs traders. But James Martin, a senior criminology lecturer, explained that these conflicting representations are the result of a battle for public legitimacy. Martin explained that online dealers say that they do this for ideological and political reasons, and that they’re making the drugs trade safer for consumers, dealers, and the general public. But according to Martin, law enforcement agencies like the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) are premised on policies that prohibit drugs, and so have a vested interest in promoting and maintaining negative stereotypes of drug dealers, both online and on the streets. Experts broadly agree with Oates' representation: “One of the things people misunderstand about Silk Road is that they think it is purely about drugs,” said Jamie Bartlett, whose new book explores phenomena like Silk Road and the dark web. Bartlett explained that while drugs were central to the site’s modus operandi, its broader, underlying philosophy supports the free market and the use of crypto-technology to guarantee individual liberty. “Silk Road started out with these grand ideas; this commitment to libertarianism, and to nonviolence,” Martin explained. The site’s founder, Dread Pirate Roberts (allegedly Ross Ulbricht), has spoken publicly in an interview with Forbes, about wanting to instigate a global crypto-anarchist revolution. “Silk Road had quite a sophisticated and very explicitly articulated vision,” Martin said. As a self-proclaimed haven of libertarianism, Martin explained that Silk Road’s ideology rested on the notion that the war on drugs and the drug prohibition has made the trade a lot more dangerous, and that services like Silk Road are actually a public good. Market appeal In Oates’ play, things start to go wrong for Bruce when the established local dealer – Mr Shaggy – starts to defend his turf. Shaggy unhesitatingly uses threats, violence, and coercion to manipulate Bruce into a partnership. According to experts, the contrast between the stereotypically aggressive drug dealer on the streets, and the more peaceable, enterprising Silk Road user, is one that holds true in real life. Martin explained that online drug vendors are unable to compete with each other using the tools of conventional dealers, namely violence and intimidation. “It’s a buyers market online, and there are thousands and thousands of dealers who all want your business,” Martin said. So instead, online vendors innovate. “One of the ideas that I explore in my new book, Drugs on the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dark Net">Dark Net</a></span>, is that as a conventional cocaine dealer you need to maintain a hard-man persona, to deter people from messing with you,” explained Martin. But online, dealers are free to create a public image that is more sensitive and might appeal more to customers. Martin said that throughout his studies on crypto-markets, he has observed a convergence with the marketing strategies that are typically associated with the conventional economy, like two-for-one gimmicks and holiday specials. He also referred to the emergence of ethical drugs marketing. The question remains, that if crypto-markets are easily accessible via encrypted browsers like Tor, why aren’t conventional dealers adopting these new methods? Bartlett said his research indicates that online communities tend to attract like-minded people. “If you’re a libertarian tech person who is interested in cryptocurrencies and cryptomarkets, you will find out about sites like Silk Road, and you’re more likely to join them,” he said, labelling the phenomenon a “self-selection bias”. The crack down At the conclusion of Silk Road (the play), Bruce realises that he has left an online “paper” trail – bank account details, compromised encryption keys – and that the authorities are converging on him. This ending mirrors key aspects of what is known about the closure of Silk Road. Both incidents can be interpreted as the result of human error. Martin said that although the closure of Silk Road was very destabilising initially, it “transformed into an act of creative destruction”. The BBC recently reported that the number of adverts for illegal drugs on the dark web has doubled, less than a year after the FBI seized Silk Road. This supports Martin’s claim that there the site’s closure left a huge market share up for grabs. “New sites are trying to outsell each other … it’s created a really dynamic online space, and the crypto-market trade is bigger now than it’s ever been,” he said. Despite claims that the Silk Road bust gave “clear notice” that law enforcement agencies have the motivation and resources to arrest illegal users of crypto-markets, experts thought otherwise. According to John Collins – coordinator of the International Drug Policy Project at LSE – the resources required, as well as the legal complications of enforcing laws across jurisdictions, make the probability of enforcement success quite small. “It would really be a case of pushing back the tide,” he said. Whatever attitude one takes toward drugs, it is obvious that sites like Silk Road challenges stereotypes and raises thought-provoking questions over drugs policy and enforcement. Oates' intelligent representation of these questions in his play Silk Road offers accessible and engaging insights for Edinburgh Fringe-goers.

                                Ars Technica reports that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> today wrote that Tesla will remove mileage limits on its warranty policy for all Tesla Model S drive units. The warranty, which will still span eight years, won't have a cap on the number of owners for each vehicle. People who purchased Teslas before today were told that the warranty period for the drive unit expired after eight years or once the car logged over 125,000 miles. The revised warranty applies to new vehicles and Model S cars that are already on the road. The article mentions that quite a few Tesla owners have had to have their drive units replaced; out of warranty, that runs about $15,000. Musk's announcement acknowledges that the change may cost the company some money, but says he's "confident it will work out well in the long run." <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                There's no real beating around the bush here: Motherboard has gotten its hands on some horrifying footage of hunting and wild animal abuse in Tanzania, where a company known as Green Mile Safari has been caught allowing its clients to hunt protected animals with semi-automatic weapons, run over animals with jeeps, and otherwise torture animals before killing them. The footage is so graphic, the crimes so egregious that the Dallas Safari Club, in a letter to Tanzania's minister of natural resources and tourism, said "without question, the video depicts some of the most abhorrent displays of unethical hunting behavior and animal abuse ever recorded." When it's done correctly, in an ethical, monitored way, there's an argument to be made that controlled hunting can actually be good for conservation. African hunting blocks are often located in the some of the poorest areas of the continent, where agriculture is impossible and where poachers often run rampant (or, in many cases, the poachers are locals themselves).  Watch: An Inside Look at America's Exotic Animal Trade Hunting inherently brings in an influx of money and law enforcement, so the thinking goes that poaching and monetary burden of endangered animals can be reduced with the practice. That's not what's happening here.  Representatives of Green Mile, owned by Awadh Ally Abdullah and Abdullah Bin Butti Alhamed of the United Arab Emirates (its website is also hosted in the UAE), can be seen in the 2012 "highlight" video above—which is somehow promotional material for the company, and which sources say is cut from a larger, two-hour raw video—shooting wildlife from jeeps, running over a baby gazelle with the jeep, allowing young children to shoot at animals, and capturing a baby zebra and torturing it while it cries and tries to get away.  Repeatedly, hunters on Green Mile Safari trips watch animals writhe as they slowly die. At one point, a hunter shoots a writhing zebra with a rifle attached to a tripod from several feet away. "What you see here are hunters treating this like their personal playground," Mary Rice, the executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency, told me. "We condemn the abuse that's taking place." The abuses originally came to light back in March, but Green Mile Safari, which several Tanzanian media outlets have suggested is well-connected politically, retained its hunting license until July, when Lazaro Nyalandu, the country's minister of natural resources and tourism revoked its permission to hunt. The footage itself has been seen by the Dallas Safari Club and members of Tanzania's parliament, but has not, until now, been released to the public. "Our country and its resources are owned by all Tanzanians. It is strictly prohibited for any person or company both local and foreign to sabotage the countrys economy by destroying the resources, Peter Msigwa, Tanzania's shadow minister of natural resources and tourism said at the time. But Green Mile is fighting that decision: It has threatened to sue the government for revoking its licenses, and there's a chance it could win. After the video was initially shown to Tanzania's parliament, no action was taken, perhaps because Green Mile is well-backed financially from its owners in the UAE. It wasn't until Nyalandu unilaterally revoked the license that hunting tours stopped. Msigwa and Nyalandu did not respond to a Motherboard request for comment, but a representative with Green Mile told me that the government—and the Dallas Safari Club—are to blame for the abuses, which is a fairly dubious claim. "Green Mile Safari Co. Ltd is also wondering why such abuses could have happened in the presence of professional hunters and Government Game Officers!," the company told me in an email. "The so called 'wild animals abuses' as seen in the hunting video were well planned by our business rivals from USA, for reasons best known to them! One will wonder why Dallas Safari Club praised the Minister shortly after he had punished the Green Mile Safari Company." The Dallas Safari Club received a spate of negative attention recently for auctioning off the chance to hunt a black rhino, but there has been no evidence that the club has been involved in any abuses of the magnitude shown in the Green Mile video (or any abuses, really). "It's a video they created and produced of their hunt," Ben Carter, Dallas Safari Club's executive director, told me. "We don't think that paints a very good picture of the hunting community, and that's not what's hunting's about. Anytime we see something like this happening, we're going to speak out about it." The Green Mile representative did not deny that the abuses occurred during Green Mile Safari-sponsored trips, and didn't deny that the abuses happened. The company said that it "learned about the said video through [Dallas Safari Club's] letter." The EIA's Rice, meanwhile, told me that, at the end of the day, Green Mile is responsible for its actions. "Although the clients are involved in the abuse, the hunting company itself are the ones who are liable," she said. "If it's done with integrity and professionalism, the animal is tracked on foot and dispatched with a single shot. There will be a professional hunter will be there to dispatch the animal quickly if the client has been unable to do that." That, clearly, is not what happened here. And it shows the perils and pitfalls of poorly regulating an activity that will inevitably, in the minds of many, be linked to poaching and animal abuse, even when it's done with the utmost care. The problem isn't limited to Tanzania. While there are well-managed safari hunting operations, limited regulation and enforcement has led to corruption and abuses throughout the industry. In one notable case, a rhino horn dealer was arrested after he paid prostitutes to pose as hunters to skirt South African hunting regulations in a bid to quasi-legally export rhino horn from the country. Regardless, allegations of hunting abuse have a long history in Tanzania, and there have been anecdotal stories of things like what you see here happening, but this is the rare, and perhaps first, case in which solid evidence of hunters screwing with and torturing animals has come out.  It probably won't be the last. "We now suspect that many other firms are involved in this illegal practice, Msigwa said last month.

                                There's no real beating around the bush here: Motherboard has gotten its hands on some horrifying footage of hunting and wild animal abuse in Tanzania, where a company known as Green Mile Safari has been caught allowing its clients to hunt protected animals with semi-automatic weapons, run over animals with jeeps, and otherwise torture animals before killing them. The footage is so graphic, the crimes so egregious that the Dallas Safari Club, in a letter to Tanzania's minister of natural resources and tourism, said "without question, the video depicts some of the most abhorrent displays of unethical hunting behavior and animal abuse ever recorded." When it's done correctly, in an ethical, monitored way, there's an argument to be made that controlled hunting can actually be good for conservation.

The finding takes scientists one step closer to a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> cure.

In patients on anti-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> drugs, latent virus can persist indefinitely. The “shock-and-kill” approach used in the research induced these hidden or latent viruses to resurface by using a combination of three drugs. “It proves the principle that a combination of drugs that activate latent virus together with antibodies can induce remission – at least in a slightly artificial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected mouse model,” she said. Professor Lewin said the principle wasn’t new. “This has been an idea we have been exploring for many years in test tube models of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> latency and more recently in clinical trials. In the few clinical trials recently completed, a range of drugs that are used for treating cancer could wake up latent virus in people but the infected cell wasn’t killed,” she said. To kill the cells, the researchers boosted the mice’s immune systems using powerful antibodies known as “broadly neutralising antibodies”. More than half (57%) of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected mice treated with the combination activating drugs together with these antibodies could keep the virus under control. Professor David Cooper, director of the Kirby Institute at the The University of New South Wales said the research represented an important model but added it was difficult to extrapolate the results to humans. “The mice were treated with the antiretroviral therapies within a day or two of infection and that is not the case globally. People don’t usually know they’re infected as soon as that,“ he said. “Many people in low- and middle-income countries aren’t identified until they get an opportunistic infection like tuberculosis and at that late stage, the amount of latent virus is very large,” he added. One unique aspect of the research was the use of three drugs to induce the latent infected cells to come out of hiding. Professor Lewin said there had been clinical trials using one drug to activate the latent virus and it was known that using two drugs to activate latent virus – at least in test tube models – led to a better effect than each alone, but a combination of drugs have not yet been tested in clinical trials. “This study went a step further and used three, showing that three drugs are better than two, which is better than one,” she said. “And these drugs worked in keeping the virus under control when combined with one of these potent antibodies.” Professor Cooper raised concerns about the toxicity of the drug combination used in the research. “One of the agents that they used in the study has been approved to treat a rare type of lymphoma, and it’s fair to say that it’s not a particularly light therapy,” he said. “It’s possible that the other types of drugs they use to shock might have these sort of toxicities. It’s very hard to tell in these mice, what the toxicities of these drugs are.” Both Lewin and Cooper agreed that safety was a key concern when trying to activate latent virus, given antiretroviral therapies were safe and allowed people with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> to have a normal lifespan. “What is interesting here is the role of broadly neutralising antibodies in eliminating latent virus,” Professor Lewin said. “These antibodies have recently been shown in monkeys to work well in preventing infection. And there are studies giving broadly neutralising antibodies to monkeys and humans on antiretroviral treatment to see if they can help keep the virus in remission.” “Whether you need three agents to activate latent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> and whether that’s even feasible given potential drug interactions, I’m not sure. But it is exciting because it shows broadly neutralising antibodies and combination activation could play a role in the kick-and-kill strategy,” she said. “That has not been shown before.”

                                It is the landscape of the interior that is most strongly associated with Sculthorpe’s music.'Two movements - Peter Sculthorpe', a portrait by Danelle Bergstrom, 2008 Archibald Prize. AAP/ Supplied Australia’s most distinguished composer Peter Sculthorpe (1929-2014) has left a magnificent legacy – his music. Sculthorpe pioneered a uniquely Australian sound. The distinctiveness of his music emerges from its connection with the landscape, the Indigenous inhabitants of the land, and with South-East Asian music. Many excellent obituaries have been published over the past week covering this, including Stuart Greenbaum’s on The Conversation, but another lesser-known legacy is his influence on two of his first students at Sydney University, composers Ross Edwards and Anne Boyd. Music ‘shaped by this land’ The geographical isolation of Australia from Europe coupled with the concept of landscape entwined with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island music, plays an important role in shaping Sculthorpe’s musical style. Explaining his use of Aboriginal music, Sculthorpe said that it: always seemed foolish not to take heed of a music that has been shaped by this land over many thousands of years. Although there are many kinds of landscape in Australia, it is the landscape of the interior that is most strongly associated with Sculthorpe’s music. This landscape is imagined as a vast, flat, arid place. It is particularly evident in works like Sun Music I (1965) where, as Gordon Kerry noted: colourful, fragmentary events take place against static <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> or luminous clouds of sound. Sculthorpe’s style is antithetical to the complexity of European serialism. It is not about the creation of an intellectual framework – such as a 12-tone row – for the expression of a musical idea. Rather, the music springs from a deep and personal engagement with human concerns. At a very young age, growing up in Tasmania, Sculthorpe was attuned to emotions such as loss, grief and loneliness. Anne Boyd summed up Sculthorpe’s music as having: a dark sorrowing under-side powered by a sense of loneliness, of yearning and of regret. Peter Sculthorpe at the National Library in Canberra with some of his archived work, 2002. AAP/ Alan Porritt The music gives expression to these emotions in works like Irkanda IV (1961), composed as a memorial to his father. The Aboriginal word irkanda literally means “scrub country” but for Sculthorpe it was associated with the idea of loneliness or “lonely place”. Whereas the Irkanda series represents the individual alone in space and time, the Sun Music series that followed presents a world devoid of human population. The orchestra is treated like a gigantic percussion instrument. Gradually through the Sun Music series there is an abandonment of European characteristics in favour of influences from Asia, in particular, the gamelan music of Indonesia and traditional music from Japan. Sculthorpe considered Australia as part of Asia. From the mid-60s onwards, Sculthorpe’s music became more and more imbued with Asian aesthetics, as well as with the music of Australian Aboriginal culture. Works such as Mangrove (1980), Earth Cry (1986), the latter a recasting of an earlier work, The Song of Tailitnama (1974) and Kakadu (1988) exemplify this style. His last large-scale work was his Requiem for mixed chorus, didgeridoo and orchestra (2004). Sculthorpe the mentor Australian composer Ross Edwards inherited something of the Sculthorpe legacy. In his own unique way, Edwards taps into the diversity of Australia and its natural environment. For Edwards, the main preoccupations are with landscape, birds, frogs and insect life. The music falls into two styles, one marked by slow ritualistic music, exemplified by a work such as Yarrageh-Nocturne for percussion and orchestra (1989), and the other by lively, rhythmic music as heard in works such as his oft-performed violin concerto Maninyas (1988). Ross Edwards and Anne Boyd were both close to Peter Sculthorpe. Boyd says that without Sculthorpe she would never have become a composer. She and Sculthorpe were engaged at one point. Although the marriage did not eventuate the relationship was deep and long-lasting. She was by his bedside in the last days of his life. As I Crossed a Bridge of Dreams - Anne Boyd. The genetics of one composer to the other are strongly evident in this relationship. The father-figure Sculthorpe passes on to the younger Boyd his ideas about music and its connection with landscape, indigenous music and the music of South East Asia. As an undergraduate student of Sculthorpe (1963-69) at Sydney University, Boyd absorbed his ideas. Boyd, like Sculthorpe, had a childhood marked by loss, grief and loneliness. She suffered tragedy at a very young age with the death of her father and then, aged 12, her mother. Music was her companion throughout as a child growing up in outback Queensland. For Boyd, the landscape surrounding her in her childhood years was etched with sorrow but also with great beauty. The childhood memories of landscape were powerfully re-awakened when she was introduced to the music of South East Asia by Sculthorpe. Boyd went on to develop and refine an Asian aesthetic, establishing a reputation for her uniquely original voice in works such as As It Leaves the Bell (1973), Angklung for solo piano (1974) and As I Crossed a Bridge of Dreams for 12 unaccompanied voices (1975). These works broke new ground and have since found a place within the established contemporary repertory worldwide. Through her collaboration with the Korean poet Don’o Kim, she conceived the basis of music to be the intersection of Christian love with Buddhist silence. Both Edwards and Boyd have, in their own distinctive ways, earned a place alongside their “father” in the world of Australian music. More than this, Sculthorpe’s encouragement of Boyd has produced one of the most important women composers in Australian music. Ultimately, the influence on all three composers is Australia itself. The outstanding legacy that each of them leaves, then, is a spiritual connection with the land.

                                You can shine light on a dog, but it's still a dog.cabancreative/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA A passer-by happens upon a drunk searching for a lost wallet under a streetlight. With nothing in plain sight, the passer-by asks “Where did you drop your wallet?”. “Over there,” gestures the drunk across the street, “but I’m looking here because this is where the light is.” We often look for answers in the easiest place and not necessarily where the answer is to be found. As marketing moves from subjective art toward objective, data-driven science, are we seeing the emergence of a streetlight effect? Are even the very best big-data driven practises guilty of asking the wrong questions of the wrong data? Wrong from the start Most companies turn to analytics when early growth starts to slow. The familiar refrain, “Let’s make better use of our existing data”, heralds the onset of maturity, This when the early days of triple and double-digit growth are well and truly past. Initial questions asked of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> are typically, “Who are our best customers?” and “Which products are most profitable?” It soon becomes clear that performance differs by region, season and a host of other factors. So, it’s not long before we want to know, “How do quarterly sales in region A compare with region B, on products X, Y, and Z?” Next comes propensity to respond (PTR) modelling, used to classify prospects for acquisition, cross sell, churn, or fraud. Where they exist, single customer views enable an entire family of PTR models used to determine next best actions. Competing marketing priorities soon warrant marketing mix modelling, to estimate the value of advertising spends across different channels. This naturally leads to attribution modelling, to estimate how each channel contributes to the final sale. The current holy grail of big-data driven marketing is to offer in real time the most likely product, at the most likely price, to the most likely customer, at the most likely time, via the most likely channel. The past doesn’t always help predict the future But does <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> and analysis make sense in the first place? Like the drunk under the streetlight, have we been seduced into looking for the answers where it is easiest? Namely, in the data we gathered from past sales to previous customers. Is this relevant for understanding future sales to future customers? Nothing in the customer data gathered, or in the way it is presently being analysed, addresses the fundamental consumer desire. This to find the best available combination of price and product at the lowest search cost. All that segmenting and clustering and PTR scoring leaves our future consumers cold, stranded, outnumbered – feeling besieged and beset upon. Consumers are bounded rational humans optimised over generations for “fight or flight” and not for solving the multidimensional optimisation problem that is rational consumer choice. Tasked with buying a car, my siblings, with common genetic and environmental influences, will likely arrive at different consumption choices to mine. If those closest to me exhibit different preferences, then why are these “previous customer” strangers with no common nature or nurture to me being used to suggest products for me? Why model the choices of thousands of people I don’t know, and who don’t know me, in an effort to suggest products to me? No consumer identifies with the clusters or segments thrown up by maximum likelihood models. In fact this type of modelling belies the constant state of flux wrought by Adam Smith’s invisible hand, and writ large in every single consumption choice. It is a complex and rapidly changing world we inhabit with little known by these analytical models about a customer’s current preferences and circumstances. The circumstances of markets, like those of individuals, can change in an instant. Products sell out, forcing consumers to choose from what’s available or to wait. Products stagnate. Promotions and discounts alter the relative attractiveness of one product compared with another, stimulating sales of one and depressing sales of another. Individual finances wax and wane as personal circumstances alter. Each and every purchase decision is a moveable feast. Even simple choices become rapidly complicated. It is little wonder consumers throw their hands up and head for the safe harbour of brand, or convenience, or availability. Focus on ‘<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=small data">small data</a></span>’ instead The data we should be analysing − <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=small data">small data</a></span> − is product attributes and prices which change over time. This is the data consumers – your customers and your competitors’ customers – are using when choosing. To the extent of their ability, each consumer is assessing, comparing and evaluating the products and services on offer. These are bundles of attributes with their corresponding “shadow prices”. Trading this attribute off against that, trying to identify the best combination of attributes with their shadow prices to suit oneself. Taking into account one’s own dynamically altering preferences over the attributes and one’s own changeable circumstances. What you should be doing is maximising the “willingness to pay”, that is the “consumer surplus”, of your potential customers. They will then tend to choose your product in preference to that of your competitors, depending on the bundle of attributes provided by your product. Analysing customer data to minimise the error of estimation, isn’t helping your customers to solve their problems – it is proliferating them. The manifold combinations and permutations are adding to the burden, not lightening the load. Customers will pay you with their custom, for simply reducing their search costs. Faced as they are with overwhelming choice, customers want up-to-date, reliable, valid and trustworthy recommendations. These embody their own personal preferences and budgets, both of which are instantly available. A version of this article first appeared on BusinessThink.

                                The Indonesian media often portrays the lives of transgender people as "sinful" and wrong. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade/Flickr, CC BY-SA A transgender woman with heavy makeup, a red wig and dressed in pink is chased by her pimp’s henchmen. A young woman hides her in her house. So begins the TV drama, a story of repentance of a transgender person. In a supposedly happy ending, the transgender woman “returns” to being a man and marries the young woman. In the film “Insyafnya Seorang Waria” (Realisation of a transgendered woman) the lead role transformed into a heterosexual man. To celebrate the Islamic holy month Ramadan and the Eid Fitr, Indonesian television station RCTI recently ran the TV drama Insyafnya seorang waria, which loosely translates as “Realisation of a transgendered woman”. Transgender women rally for their rights in a 2008 photo. LGBT rights groups protested over the film. Yulian Hendriyana/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA The film has drawn criticism from LGBT rights organisations in Indonesia for its misrepresentation of transgender people. Some members of the LGBT group protested through the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission, a government body that oversees implementation of broadcasting law in Indonesia. They have yet to receive feedback from the commission or the television station. The film has a religious theme that is currently popular on various television channels in Indonesia. Since the fall of Indonesian dictator Suharto, who clamped down on any political dissent, political Islam has undergone a revival. With this, religious themes have become more common in popular culture. Transgender people in the media A compound from wanita (woman) and pria (man), waria is an Indonesian term for transgender people. They have always been visible in the nation’s media. Films with waria characters abound. Waria characters are also often presented in films, soap operas, comedies, infotainment and talk shows. Waria are often portrayed in a scornful manner. The media often make fun of and bully waria characters, using them as a laughing stock. Further, media portrayals of transgender people in Indonesia often start from the assumption that it’s a sin to be a trans. The film Insyafnya seorang waria is a blatant example of this. The often over-the-top portrayals of waria depict transgender people in a negative light. In one of the film’s scenes, after “transforming” into a masculine heterosexual man the lead actor says: “It’s so hard to be good.” This statement implies a past as a waria is something bad, that being a waria is wrong. Commodification of religious discourse The use of the word insyaf, which means “to realise”, in the film refers to someone being aware of his or her mistake and trying to fix it. Another word that is often used in religious-themed cinema is tobat, meaning “to repent”. To realise (one’s mistake) or to repent is to become religious, usually by being a pupil of a religious teacher who would guide them to the right path. In Insyaf, the film’s lead changes the way she dresses into Islamic masculine clothes. She “realises” her mistake and “transforms” herself to be a “normal” heterosexual man. In Insyaf, the past is depicted as a dark side to be forgotten. As the transgendered woman becomes a heterosexual man, she becomes a he. As if one’s pronoun is a choice. As a man, he should marry a woman as a manifestation of the ideal norm for masculinity. The film ends with a wedding ceremony. Insyaf’s narrative is an effort to reproduce and preserve the heteronormativity ideology in Indonesia’s society. The right and normal sexuality is heterosexual within marriage. Anything outside of that is considered perverse and not normal. In this context, the media become part of surveillance practices – borrowing Foucault’s term – to discipline individuals' sexuality. Through films, soap operas, infotainment and others the media become part of the regime of truth. It disseminates the discourse on transgender identity as something that defies social and religious norms. With films such as Insyaf, the media play a role in defining the boundaries of accepted sexuality within the society. To do this, the film deploys religious discourse, especially Islam, to affirm moral norms on sexuality. Sexuality becomes a battleground for power in order to control social order. Religion is used to set up rules that dictate which sexual practises are acceptable. The use of religious discourse through the media is a manifestation of the commodification of religion in contemporary Indonesia. Misrepresentation harms transgender people Media misrepresentation of transgendered people can influence people’s perceptions and attitudes. Transgendered people in Indonesia face violence, stigma and discrimination on a daily basis. There have been numerous reports of deaths and assaults on transgender women by officers of the state and the public in general. Laverne Cox, who plays a transgender woman in Orange is the New Black, is an advocate for better media representation for transgender people in the US. Cynr/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND In 2008, the debate about waria representation in the media surfaced when the broadcasting commission prohibited the media from using campy waria characters. However, they did this more to “protect” children and prevent them from imitating waria. Indonesian broadcasting law prohibits programs that portray minority groups and people with disabilities in a negative light. Globally, there have been breakthroughs in media representation of transgender people. In the US, TV series such as Orange Is the New Black and Glee) have featured transgender people as not mere caricatures but rounded complex characters. Insyaf and the lack of action from the broadcasting commission show Indonesia still has a long way to go.

                                What do your shopping decisions tell marketers about you?Daniel Lee/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND The days when Coles and Woolworths only sold groceries are long gone. Both are now established players in a broad range of consumer markets, with interests in liquor and hotels, fuel and convenience, general merchandise and mobile phones. With a network of over 1,600 supermarkets, 1,100 service stations, 2,200 liquor stores and nearly 400 hotels, the supermarket duo are now getting ready for a war with Australia’s big four banks. Dubbed the “clash of the titans” by the ABC’s 7.30 program, Coles and Woolworths are said to have entered high-level talks to create their very own banks. In September 2013, Coles took the first steps towards providing financial products to the Australian market when it applied for the necessary licences. In late June 2014, Woolworths registered the trademark Woolworths Money with the Australian Trade Marks Office. While the new trademark enables Woolworths to centralise its financial offerings, such as insurances and credit cards, it may signpost a desire to expand into deposit taking, personal loans, residential mortgages and even superannuation and retirement funds. It appears Coles is following suit and it has registered the trademarks Coles Money and Coles Financial. The two supermarkets have dipped their toes into the banking pool in the past, offering credit cards and insurance policies, while just last month Coles announced it was moving into the personal loan market with GE Capital. But this latest venture has the potential to change the way banks do business. Rather than using standard measures of risk, Coles and Woolworths will be relying on your shopping habits to give them that competitive edge over the other banks. The power of major retailers has sparked protests in the UK as well as Australia. Jon Starbuck/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA An appetite for data Following in the footsteps of the British supermarket retailer Tesco, Coles and Woolworths plan to use shopper data — such as where a customer buys fuel to detect how far they drive — to tailor and develop their financial products. 14.5 million Australians use FlyBuys and Woolworths Rewards loyalty cards, gathering a treasure-trove of data on consumer habits, budgets and lifestyles. Combine this with data from partners like Telstra, Qantas, WebJet and Medibank, it becomes pretty clear that Coles and Woolworths will have an advantage. In a recording obtained by the ABC, Woolworths Director of Group Retail Services, Penny Winn, explained how the company might use this consumer data to assess financial risk. Customers who drink lots of milk and eat lots of red meat are very, very, very good car insurance risks versus those who eat lots of pasta and rice, fill up their petrol at night, and drink spirits. What that means is we’re able to tailor an insurance offer that targets those really good insurance risk customers and give them a good deal. At the other end of the spectrum they will also avoid those customers engaged in risky behaviours, such as people buying a lot of medicines and vitamins to reduce high blood pressure or high cholesterol – or these new banks could charge a higher premium for car insurance to people who purchase performance car magazines. The possibilities are endless. Risky business Graeme Samuel, former chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), believes that ready access to consumer data could be just what is needed to shake things up among the big four banks and force cheaper products overall. One of the masterminds behind Tesco Bank in the 1990s is Andrew Higginson, and he says Tesco’s database of shopper information proved invaluable in developing finance products. Simple examples would be, say, if you had a group of customers who tended to buy their fuel from Tesco in the same place every time, you could deduce that those customers might only travel short distances in their local neighbourhood. In a car insurance sense, that’s a lot safer. There’s a lower risk of accidents than someone who might be driving thousands of miles up and down the country every year. Samuel also points out online giants such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon are already using data to profile consumers and it’s simply the way people now do business. Yet some privacy activists have raised questions about the legality of such practises. Flybuyer beware Independent consumer group Choice says customers of both supermarkets may not be aware of how much information they are giving away. An evaluation by Choice of the various rewards programs available found most of these programs offer such poor rewards that you generally save less than a dollar per $100 spent. In return the supermarkets gain access to a well of information, including whether you’re a smoker, prefer organic produce or buy low-fat margarine. We have no doubt this looming combination of shopping, financial and insurance data will give Coles and Woolworths unmatched power to segment markets, tailor offers and mitigate their risks. The supermarkets will claim the use of “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” will inevitably lead to lower costs for safer drivers and financially responsible consumers, and this is a good thing. But we wonder if customers will continue to part with their information so freely if they become more aware of the impact it has on other parts of their lives, such as the cost of their insurance or home loan.

And no more so than in the area of humanities and creative arts research. If I had a dollar for every person who has told me over the past year or so that you can’t learn anything about art/culture/society from studying “the numbers” I would be my own independently financed research institute by now. And yet the current and important debate about private telecommunications data, prompted by proposed revisions to national security laws, shows just how revealing large-scale transactional metadata can be. Since the end of 2012 a team of researchers at Deakin and RMIT universities has been gathering global film business data to determine and measure the critical factors affecting film industry performance in a period of transition. The project, called Kinomatics, is also an opportunity for us to assess the usefulness of metadata-driven research for a field like cinema studies. What is kinomatics? The term “kinomatics” is derived from the word “kinematics”, the study of the geometry of motion, and “kino”, a term for cinema. We like to think of Kinomatics as the study of the industrial geometry of motion pictures. As such it is not at all like the typical approach to university-based cinema research. This visualisation shows the distribution of cinema “playweeks” around the world – that is, the day of the week on which films open. Alwyn Davidson/Kinomatics Kinomatics is part of a broader, emerging disciplinary shift in the humanities, away from a traditional focus on measuring the value and meaning of cultural artefacts (such as films) to recognising instead the significance of cultural flows and transactions. Kinomatics began as the offshoot of an Australian Research Council-funded project examining the contemporary business of cinema distribution and exhibition in Australia. The film business is, and has been from the outset, a global enterprise. So in order to really understand Australia’s film economy we quickly realised we needed a more global perspective, one that could account for the cinema’s international, interdependent, overlapping and uneven networks. This image describes the predominant films screening in Australia on Boxing Day 2013. Blue: The Hobbit 2; Green: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty; Purple: Frozen; Orange: Anchorman 2; Yellow: Philomena; Grey: Other titles. Alwyn Davidson/Kinomatics Our focus had shifted from trying to understand which particular aspects of which particular movies might explain film industry performance – Was it the depressing script? Was it the inadequate budget? – to a more systemic overview. This adjustment in turn required us to find different sources of evidence to answer our questions. (What is the impact of environmental conditions on film diffusion? What are the spatial and temporal dimensions of cinema circulation?). Rather than the content of the films themselves we were much more interested in the metadata that describes the cinema’s social, institutional and commercial transactions. Working with Big Cultural Data: three supersize takeaways The Kinomatics dataset that forms the basis for our research is a unique collection of more than 250 million “showtime” records, capturing information about all film screenings in 48 countries over a 30-month period (2012-2015). The locations of the cinemas around the globe that are contributing data to Kinomatics. Alwyn Davidson/Kinomatics Kinomatics adopts many of the techniques that have been developed in recent years within the Digital Humanities. These include the use of APIs, visualisation techniques and data analysis approaches based around the making and mining of the horizontal relationships between data (rather than the vertical relationships favoured by archivists, for example). As one of the first “big cultural data” projects of its kind, Kinomatics has been a massive learning curve for the research team. Here are our top three takeaways as we’ve come to grips with our supersized database: 1. It’s not how big your data is, it’s what you do with it that counts. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> doesn’t necessarily refer to the size of the data (after all today’s “big” data is tomorrow’s iota) but it does mean that the size of the data is one of the problems that need be resolved. In fact, in Kinomatics the data just keeps growing. Through further integrating different types of data (demographic data, social media data, technical infrastructure data, economic and financial data and climatic data, for example) we have been able to explore the value of an “expanded” approach to cultural data, rather than simply focusing on the idea of one “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>set” per se. 2. Big Cinema Data requires a “big” range of expertise. We are a collaborative team with a wide range of skill sets. And yet we could always do with more. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big data">Big data</a></span> studies involve accumulating your evidence base before you begin to develop your approach to it. This iterative and exploratory approach differs from conventional academic methodologies. We often confront colleagues who believe that working with data involves proposing a query and, hey presto!, an answer magically appears on the screen. Working with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> involves careful consideration, multiple iterations, experimentations and interpretations. It’s a process of constant decision-making. In a sense <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> studies are always in beta. In our experience the bigger the team, the more considered the approach can be. 3. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> does not always lead to Big Breakthroughs. In part, the backlash against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> represents a classic Gartner hype curve trough. But data scepticism is important. No matter how large your dataset, it is never comprehensive and it is never unbiased. In our experience we have been able to make assertions about specifically defined research problems that account for the type of data and the way it has been gathered. For example, part of our interest in the factors concerned with the diffusion of film across cinemas around the globe is to better understand the factors that drive diffusion and diversity in domestic film markets. We’ve explored this by looking at a range of case studies such as the spread of High Frame Rate technologies via the release of The Hobbit movies; the volume of transactions between cinema nations expressed in the form of dyadic networks; the relationship between the flow of remittances (the money sent home by migrants) and the movement of Indian films around the globe; and engaging everyday cinemagoers with our dataset through the CinemaCities Ranking index. Working with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> requires a changed mindset. Researchers need to be able to work at scale and be comfortable answering questions with probabilities rather than definitive conclusions. Perhaps the critical question now is not what we can do with the data as much as what the data is doing to us as researchers.

Millions of gallons of a cocktail of water, sand and chemicals are injected into the horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale, releasing the gas—and causing violent protests in Europe and parts of America.Geothermal energy, by contrast, has yet to stir much controversy. Most geothermal plants are located where water has seeped down into the Earth’s crust, been heated and forced back up through permeable rock. Drill a well to between 3,000 and 12,000 feet, and the searing water and steam can be released to drive generators.Geothermal is a minnow among power sources. America has the world’s highest installed capacity of geothermal generating plants—3.4 gigawatts’ worth at last count (see first chart)—but they generate only 0.4% of its electricity (see second chart).

                                China is betting long-term on unconventional gas, but it is running into problems developing its vast shale resources.
