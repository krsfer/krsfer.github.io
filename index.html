							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								Imagine this: You're sitting in a booth in TGI Fridays, minding your own business, thinking about which appetizer to order, when a flying <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> covered in mistletoe comes careening at your face. This is literally what happened to photojournalist Georgine Benvenuto last Thursday evening at a TGI Fridays in Brooklyn. The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>, NYMag reports, is "part of a TGI Fridays promotion meant 'to help inspire more guests to come together underneath the mistletoe and experience #Togethermas this Christmas.'" Benvenuto told NYMag that she arrived at the TGI Fridays on assignment — she was to take photos of couples kissing underneath the promotional <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. She was joined by a few other writers.  The man operating the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s (there were a few) was showing "Vanessa Ogle, the Brooklyn Daily reporter writing the story, that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> could land easily on her hand." Here's what followed, in Benvenuto's words to NYMag, It kind of landed, but it did something to her hand--I don't know whether it was buzzing or what--but she flinched. And when she flinched, I was standing maybe a foot away from her, and this smaller toy <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> for children flies into my face at that point. It was like I couldn’t get it off because I guess the mistletoe part had fishing wire on it--that’s how it was attached--and it got caught in my hair and it kept twirling and twirling and twirling while this thing is on my nose. That’s how it ended up cutting me under the chin, I think it had four blades. So immediately like I’m trying to get this thing off as if it was a huge bug trying to shoo it away. "If that would've hit me in my eye, I wouldn't be working tomorrow," she adds. "If this thing continued to spin, it would've taken my eye out without a doubt."

							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> is a bookish billionaire — as we've reported before, he has a love of all things science fiction.  On Monday, he tweeted about a favorite book that's helped clarify his galactic ambitions. "Reread Asimov's Foundation series," he said. "Brilliant."  In interviews, Musk has said that "Foundation" by Isaac Asimov is "one of the best books" that he's ever read. The trilogy tells the story of an intergalactic empire that falls to pieces, with a dark age waiting on the other side.   "Foundation" is a "futuristic version of Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,'" he told the Guardian, referencing the famous history that followed Rome from its breathtaking heights to the fall of Byzantium. From "Foundation," Musk learned that every civilization — including our own — will one day falter.  "The lessons of history would suggest that civilizations move in cycles," Musk told the Guardian. "You can track that back quite far — the Babylonians, the Sumerians, followed by the Egyptians, the Romans, China. We're obviously in a very upward cycle right now and hopefully that remains the case. But it may not. There could be some series of events that cause that technology level to decline."  And when that happens in our case — when humanity hits its own dark age — what's the best thing we can do to make sure it's as short as possible?  By having the human race become, to use Musk's favored terminology, interplanetary. Thus the need for SpaceX, the privatized space exploration company that Musk started back when only nation-states were trying to launch rockets out of Earth's atmosphere.  "Given that this is the first time in 4.5 billion years where it's been possible for humanity to extend life beyond Earth," he said, "it seems like we'd be wise to act while the window was open and not count on the fact it will be open a long time." <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: 9 Decisions That Shaped <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>'s Extraordinary Career Join the conversation about this story »</span>

								At the recent OPEC meeting Saudi Arabia argued for oil production levels to remain stable. www.shutterstock.com As at early December, the international price of crude oil is around US$70 a barrel, depending on grade. Over the last six months, oil prices have slumped by 30% and crude oil is now at its lowest level since mid-2010. Recently OPEC members elected to ignore this price slide and chose not to cut production. What drives oil prices? Despite this recent price slump, oil prices remain within a historically high band. This price surge started in around 2003 and reflects the persistent long-term growth of the key oil import markets of China and India. The price surge was only briefly interrupted in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis due to negative economic conditions. At this time, in December 2008, the Brent spot price briefly dropped to US$34 a barrel. Regional contingencies like wars and civil strife also influence oil prices. However, there is some room for deliberate policy influence, notably by OPEC members, which produce 40% of the world’s oil supply. These countries also produce a much higher global proportion of oil with very low production costs. Since the OPEC crisis of the 1970s, OPEC, especially the key “swing producer” Saudi Arabia, has used its surplus capacity to influence price. The OPEC cartel is clumsy, however, given that some member states have an incentive to “cheat” by exceeding their authorised production quotas. The fallout from OPEC’s decision to maintain production At its meeting in late November this year, OPEC effectively endorsed the position of its so-called oil price “doves” (Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait) that there be no attempt to cut output levels. A cut in output would act to reverse the recent price erosion. OPEC’s decision was to retain the aggregate production target of 30 million barrels a day - a level that was agreed back in December 2011. The November decision has been to the detriment of Russia, which is not an OPEC member but a major oil and gas producer and exporter, along with OPEC members Iran and Venezuela. Each of these oil price “hawks” is suffering from painful and potentially destabilising major declines in petroleum export revenues. Table 1 indicates two versions of a series of break-even points below which national oil producing states and their budgets suffer as the price of oil declines. It remains to be seen whether oil prices at their current levels will limit Saudi Arabia’s considerable financial support to Egypt’s military regime and to Sunni elements in the Syrian civil war. It is unlikely, however, that oil prices will continue to fall significantly in the medium term. Market-induced cuts to production by high-cost suppliers will limit further price declines. For example, United States supplies of “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tight oil">tight oil</a></span>” are said to be at risk once global oil prices fall below US$60 a barrel in terms of the current costs of existing operations or even US$90 a barrel in terms of investment in new projects. The economic impacts of the recent oil price slump on the global macro-economy are multiple, complex and conflicting. Though not typical, the Australian case is illustrative. The windfall of falling oil prices reduces the cost of net oil imports and favours industries sensitive to transport costs. However, LNG exporters tied to lower oil prices may experience some reduced profits. Benefits to the oil-dependent Chinese, Indian and Japanese economies will also indirectly benefit Australian exporters of raw materials and energy-related commodities. US petropolitics and US-Saudi alliance: perhaps over-blown? Since the mid-1970s, geopolitical theories of oil price determination have relied on the notion that the US can influence Saudi Arabia’s “swing producer” capabilities. This alliance dates back to US President Franklin Roosevelt’s historic meeting with Ibn Saud in 1945. It has been reflected in Saudi Arabia’s role in stabilising oil prices in the mid-1980s and during the first Iraq war in the 1990s. However, the Saudi-OPEC role in reversing the dramatic collapse of oil prices in 1998 was a case of rectifying its failure to foresee the Asian economic crisis, and required no prompt from the US. The Saudi failure to endorse production cuts at the November 27 OPEC meeting has been depicted as reflecting US wishes. Specifically, that the US might have wished to place continued pressure on the three “price hawks”, which also happen to be US adversaries. However, OPEC’s own agreed rhetoric emphasised the need for OPEC to nurture a global recovery in the major oil import-dependent economies of China, India and Europe, to the advantage of major oil exporters. The most important recent major development on the supply side of global petroleum markets is the US-based “revolution in non-conventional petroleum”, including <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>-based production of “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tight oil">tight oil</a></span>” and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span>. Two geopolitical claims are made about this development, which supposedly allows scope for the US to reduce its entanglement with Middle East politics. The first is the claim it permits the US to pivot toward East Asia. This questionable aspiration is now being undermined by the Islamic State crisis in Iraq and Syria and the increasing tension between OPEC’s oil price “doves” and “hawks”, respectively led by (Sunni) Saudi Arabia and (Shia) Iran in particular. The other claim is these new production developments will allow the US to wield an “oil weapon” directly, rather than through Saudi Arabia, through its supposedly enhanced control over petroleum markets. This is a prescription embraced in the US both by supporters of deregulating US petroleum exports and by foreign policy hard-liners. However, current US pressure on the Iranian and Russian economies and their petroleum sectors has taken the form of selective and targeted economic sanctions rather than the less discriminating blunt method of undermining world oil prices. The much celebrated US-based non-conventional petroleum industry also has a high cost structure. Commercially this industry favours higher oil prices just as much as price “hawks” such as Russia.

Mophie RED iPhone Case There are so many reasons to love this RED iPhone 5 case ($120)—the ruby color, the fact that it comes with a juice pack air case for when your battery runs low, and most especially, the fact that five percent of the proceeds go to the Global Fund to help fight <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>. Mend 13-Inch Laptop Sleeve Handmade in Uganda, this laptop sleeve ($25, originally $59) isn't just gift-worthy for its sleek look. The case was created by the organization Invisible Children to help empower women affected by the Lord's Resistance Movement conflict. Vers 1Q Speakers Your friend or family member can jam to her favorite tunes thanks to this wireless wooden speaker ($130) with Bluetooth that remembers up to 10 devices. Even better, the company will match your $1 donation to the Arbor Day Foundation if you choose to do so at checkout.

								Will small video cams like this keep police honest? Michael Brown’s recent shooting death by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson illustrates the pressing importance of digitally documenting police activity, while Eric Garner’s case illustrates the limits. Had Officer Wilson been wearing a body camera, we would have a far better understanding of just what, exactly, triggered Brown’s death. But the existence of a video capturing Garner’s death-by-chokehold was not enough to persuade a New York grand jury to indict. So what does this tell us about the value of recordings? We need recordings, and we need them not just to investigate high-profile shootings. There is a growing demand for accurate recording of the entire spectrum of police activity, making greater transparency of policing an urgent priority. However, recordings by themselves are not a magic bullet. The need for more recording is undeniable. Unless a bystander has a cell-phone camera ready, our knowledge of contested facts too often depends solely on the reports of police officers and the citizens with whom they interact. Although we know that most police officers do make a good faith effort to accurately report the facts, we also know that some officers do not. For instance, according to a recent survey one out of every seventeen Denver police officers has been subject to administrative discipline for “departing from the truth” in matters related to their official duties That figure counts only those who have been formally sanctioned. Concerns about police dishonesty extend throughout the evidence-gathering phases of criminal procedure. Police officers have been found lying about observing suspects engaged in illegal activities, where and how contraband was recovered, and whether suspects consented to searches, were given Miranda warnings, or confessed. The mind can play tricks on us Even when police make good faith efforts to comply with the law, unintentional bias, poor memory, and sloppy procedures can undermine the accuracy of arrest reports, interview reports, and testimony. This leads investigators and courts to make incorrect inferences regarding the reliability or admissibility of evidence or even, in some cases, about a defendant’s substantive guilt. Problems of this sort arise because the investigatory process occurs in a black box. Absent blind trust in the accuracy and honesty of first person accounts, we cannot be confident that we know what really happened. While there are limits, digital recording technology presents a promising solution. Although some jurisdictions have begun to experiment with new recording technology, no jurisdiction has implemented a comprehensive digital recording requirement for all police activities. But it could be done. The technology now exists to cheaply and easily document all aspects of a police investigation. Stationhouse questioning and lineup administration could be easily handled through use of conventional video recording devices. Dashboard cameras already record highway stops in numerous jurisdictions. For encounters in the field, as President Obama recent urged, so-called “body worn video” could cheaply and easily be used to document police-citizen encounters. There are numerous reasons to use technology to monitor police activity. Visual recordings provide far more complete and accurate evidence of key evidentiary events, such as police-citizen confrontations, confessions and eyewitness identifications. Without recording, prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges, and juries are all left reconstructing the key events of an investigation based on often conflicting hearsay accounts from police, the defendant, and eyewitnesses. Given the ease of making a digital recordings, it is simply crazy to expect juries routinely to accept police officers’ hearsay accounts when they could instead be presented a real-time recording of the event. Given the obvious advantages, the question is not whether we should routinely record police activity, but why such recording technology hasn’t already been more widely adopted. Police have their own reasons for objecting to video There are four main reasons. First, police departments believe, rightly or wrongly, that secrecy is vital to their effectiveness, and that courts and the general public will misperceive or misinterpret their conduct if they are caught taking shortcuts. Second, even entirely by-the-book police officers resist pervasive recording because of privacy concerns. Third, figuring out how to handle massive amounts of digital data presents real hurdles, and courts are reluctant to devote the resources needed to sift through the massive amounts of data that would be produced by pervasive recording, nor have they mastered how such data can be presented to jurors cheaply, efficiently, and consistent with traditional rules of evidence. Finally, police departments point to tight budgets as a reason not to invest in digital recording. While these are real concerns, they are not insurmountable. Jurors are surprisingly sophisticated when it comes to understanding, and tolerating, legitimate but deceptive or devious investigative strategies. The police need for tactical secrecy must, at some point, give way to the need to deter police misconduct and document facts that might be critical to the determination of guilt and innocence. Likewise, police officers’ potential privacy concerns, while understandable, are overstated. Employers generally are free to surveil their employees as long as they provide adequate notice. Police officers, moreover, are uniquely public actors and are routinely expected to perform their duties in front of spectators. (Of course, privacy concerns are not limited to police, and may be even more acutely felt by citizens who interact with them. Protections would need to be developed for them.) Finally, neither court procedures nor police budgets should stand in the way. The expense of digital cameras is relatively small. If using cameras prevents even one one major civil rights lawsuit, it would more than cover the costs. And whether or not we move toward widespread recording, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> is coming, and lawyers and courts will have to learn to handle it. The justice system will adapt. Of course, cameras are no panacea. The Eric Garner case is only the latest reminder that people can see an event for themselves and still disagree about what happened. The difference, however, is that with the video, we have a basis for discussion. Like the Rodney King beating before it, the recording is the prerequisite for the conversation that followed. Factual knowledge is needed to figure out how, or whether, things must change. And increased transparency is needed not just in force cases, but at every stage of criminal justice. As both the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases so tragically demonstrate, we need to know the facts. That much is obvious. Figuring out what to do with that knowledge is more difficult, and even more essential. _ Russell Dean Covey does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.

								<span class="enum">3.</span>Is Ebola diverting resources from other neglected diseases?
							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								Ebola isn't the only disease we need to worry about. Jason Reed/Reuters Thanks in part to the Ebola crisis, neglected diseases have grabbed the world’s attention. These diseases predominantly affect developing nations with limited resources to fund research, pay for treatments, and support public health infrastructure. The commercial prospects for drugs and treatments targeting neglected diseases are also limited, which in turn means that there is little research and development. But now some scientists worry that increased funding for Ebola will draw funds away from other research programs targeting diseases such as malaria. As the outbreak continues, more resources are being poured into Ebola drug and vaccine development. A number of public and private sector stakeholders are now heavily involved in development and clinical trials. But companies like Tekmira and Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the producer of the Ebola treatment ZMapp, need larger partners to move investigational drugs past the early stages of clinical development, and to ramp up production once the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves a drug or vaccine for marketing. With funding for most neglected diseases stagnating instead of growing, the Ebola crisis may, however, be diverting attention away from the resources required to continue to combat diseases with a substantially larger disease incidence. Moreover, experts say that the Ebola outbreak has produced a “silent killer.” Thousands of hidden cases of malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and typhoid are going untreated. Thomas Teuscher of Roll Back Malaria says under-treatment of malaria has been particularly conspicuous amid the Ebola epidemic. Investing in neglected diseases Funding increases targeting malaria, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDs">AIDs</a></span> and tuberculosis have cut infection rates and boosted survival. In 1999, the global investment in neglected disease drug development was less than US$100 million. Around 2000, funding began to increase significantly, due to an influx of resources from governments, philanthropies, product development partnerships (PDPs) between public and private sector, and private industry. By 2008, investment in neglected disease drug development rose to nearly US$3 billion. Since then, however, funding has plateaued. Most of this funding has been directed at just three diseases: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, malaria and tuberculosis. These three diseases are called the “Big Three” as they take up two-thirds of the total number of dollars invested in neglected diseases research. Spending on research for pediatric treatments for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> accounts for about one-third of neglected disease funding. Malaria and tuberculosis account for 17% and 16%, respectively. It’s worth noting that resources targeting Ebola drug and vaccine development were negligible through 2012. This funding increase appears to have produced results. Since 2000, 46 new drugs have been approved, treating a multitude of diseases, including <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, malaria, leishmaniasis, and typhoid. And from 2009 through 2013, regulatory agencies approved 20 new products, ranging from vaccines to tests and treatments for tuberculosis, Chagas disease, and cholera. Because of these new products and better access to existing drugs, the number of new <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infections among children worldwide has decreased by over 50% since 2001. The death rate from tuberculosis has decreased by 45% since the World Health Organization declared it a global public health emergency in 1993. Malaria mortality rates have fallen by 42% worldwide since 2000. But, the inclusion of newly approved products on the World Health Organization’s Essential Drug List has been slow and limited, with only 44% of products approved after 2000 added. This list contains drugs that meet the health care needs of the majority of the population, and therefore should be available at all times in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms. Drug developers could do more to facilitate access, in particular, by working closely with the World Health Organization to expedite assessment of the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of new approvals. Annually the “Big Three” still cause over 3.5 million deaths across the globe. Other diseases, such as leishmaniasis and Dengue fever, contribute to over 20,000 deaths each. Malaria and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> appear to have benefited most from increased funding, while there has been much less success in other diseases, such as trachoma, river blindness, Buruli ulcer and Dengue fever. This uneven progress indicates funding could be better targeted. Moving forward, efforts by product development partnerships, the pharmaceutical industry and governments worldwide to address neglected diseases must expand. Additionally, funding of neglected disease drug development should be a function of both the disease burden (morbidity and mortality) suffered and the lack of treatment alternatives.

								<span class="enum">2.</span>In Conversation with Nigel Crisp: Ebola response and lessons from African health leaders
							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								By sharing their insights and knowledge, African leaders can improve health throughout the world. The Aspen Institute/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND Ebola has focused the world’s attention on the challenges of health care in Africa. The continent has 11% of the world’s population but 25% of the world’s disease burden. It also has just 1.3% of the global health workforce. Yet African health leaders have shown enormous creativity, innovation and leadership in tackling global health challenges. University of Melbourne Professor of Public Health Rob Moodie spoke with Lord Nigel Crisp about his new book – African Health Leaders: Making Change and Claiming the Future – and the lessons Australia and the world can learn from African health leaders. Nigel Crisp is an independent crossbench member of the House of Lords, where he co-chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Global Health. Lord Crisp was chief executive of the National Health Service in England and permanent secretary of the UK Department of Health between 2000 and 2006. Speaking with: Nigel Crisp. Rob Moodie: If I could start out by setting the scene from your latest book, African Health Leaders: Making Change and Reclaiming the Future. In it, your co-editor, Ugandan doctor Francis Omaswa, writes that over the past 30 to 40 years, the relationship between donors and African countries has been pretty mixed. As he says, donors have helped improve things but it’s been done at a price. He talks about a loss of core values, the loss of self-respect, self-confidence and self-determination. What do you think has gone wrong? Nigel Crisp: Well, I think there was a certain inevitability about it. The quotation he uses is: we went begging for help and we got it in return for some of our core values. I suppose they were in the position of being weak in terms of their negotiating position, they were looking for help, and I suppose we came in from the west (and I associate the UK and the US and Australia and elsewhere) and tried to do our best. You’ll know that very often you can come into a country and you can think you know the solutions because actually you’ve seen something similar in your own country. What, of course, you often forget and it takes you some time to remember and recognise, is that there are big cultural issues about how you do things and it’s not just as simple as applying our knowledge in another country. You can’t just transplant western health policies into African settings. hdptcar/Flickr, CC BY Now, a lot of what was actually done by the west has been terrific, obviously things like the development of antiretovirals and so on. So there’s western science and all sorts of very good things. But we’ve slightly steamrolled it, and there’s also been political issues. If I take the American example of PEPFAR, they had to report to [the US] Congress very clearly on results and what they were doing, and that political tie pulls them back into Americans doing things, rather than Americans supporting other people to do things. Rob Moodie: The other argument that you spell out are the huge challenges for Africa. It has 11% of the world’s population, but 25% of the world’s disease burden, 65% of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> burden and a huge cut of the malaria burden, yet such a tiny proportion of the global health workforce. You note that there have been some real successes out of this sort of adversity – task substitution is one. Your book is telling us what can we learn from African leaders in this regard. Nigel Crisp: Yes, well I think there’s a lot of hidden stories, unsung heroes, because inevitably in the UK and America and around the world the stories you hear are the stories about your own people. We hear about the great successes of the Bob Geldolf sort of mission and we don’t hear these stories from people actually within the situation, the leaders who are there all the time. Within the book you’ll have noticed they’re always very respectful of the help that others give them, they’re welcoming of the help that others give them. But they want more space for themselves. You do have these fantastic leaders. Let me start with Miriam Were in Kenya, 1976. Top medical student of the year, she did her PhD then on patient participation. And she did it on patient participation in 1976 because she’d recognised that actually the biggest issues about health were about hygiene and how patients behaved and how villages behaved. She was going to have the biggest impact by doing that. So she set up these programs, which are really the forerunners of many community health worker programs all across Africa. And it’s a really interesting set of issues about not just patient involvement, but community involvement – how you get people involved. Community involvement has a big impact on health outcomes. hdptcar/Flickr, CC BY Some of that has now been taken and copied and is being used in New York, working with a different sort of community but using the same sort of principles. So here you have a really important point about how you use a community to help itself, or how you help a community to help itself. Or the other one that was also in 1976 was a young doctor called Pascoal Moccumbi who, like a lot of these leaders, had been in exile fighting a revolution. The Portuguese left after independence in 1974. By 1976 he found himself the Minister of Health, and he found he had no doctors because the Portuguese had left and they were basically the doctors. His biggest pressing problem was pregnant women and how to care for them. So he set up a program of training, essentially nurses, to be able to do obstetric surgery, including Cesarean sections. They did it so well that it was being done at the same complication rate as it would be with physicians, at about a third of the price. And, of course, the nurses stayed in the country. Now, 37 or 38 years later, it’s still continuing as successfully as it was then, and it’s peer-reviewed and so on. It has been a really interesting success story and I think that whilst I’m not suggesting that here in Australia that cesareans should be done by nurses – others may wish to suggest that – it’s a point about the principles. It’s about opening your mind so you don’t have to think in terms of the boundaries of doctors and nurses that have essentially been negotiated through trade agreements and that there are some principles which show how you can actually do that sort of task-shifting successfully. Rob Moodie: In fact, in the UK, and certainly in Australia, we could learn from that in terms of practice nurses and nurse practitioners. It seems to be an ongoing demarcation dispute with the doctors, can’t we learn from that? Nigel Crisp: Exactly, and I gather you have an issue about nurses and endoscopists at the moment in Sydney or somewhere, I was told. Task substitution must be seen as part of a bigger plan of teamwork. Woody Collins/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA Well we’ve gone past that in the UK; we’ve actually got nurses and endoscopists and they’re just normal; and we’ve got nurses prescribing and so on. But it’s the same set of principles. There are basically five principles we pull out in the book, which are: Make sure you’ve got a plan. Make sure you’re recruiting the right people because it’s not just any nurse. Make sure they’re properly trained. Make sure they’ve got access to supervision and the ability to refer. Because quite a lot of these schemes – and there have been lots of them around the world as you’ll know – have failed because when people got out of their depth there wasn’t someone to refer on to. Then, finally, make sure that this is seen as part of a bigger plan of teamwork and teams. By and large, when you see those five things applied, you see these things working successfully – whether they’re in the UK or Australia or indeed in Malawi or Mozambique. Rob Moodie: If I could also ask you about the question or the issue of the day, which is obviously Ebola. It has focused so much international attention on health systems in West Africa. But also, it really does bring this up as a global issue: what’s our international response? What’s the capacity of the local workforce? And what might we have done better, both there and internationally, to have responded to the challenge of Ebola? Nigel Crisp: Well, what I think is interesting about Ebola – and you’ll know this better than I – is that it’s not that easy to transmit. You’ve actually got to have contact with body fluids, unlike something like SARS, which is therefore much more frightening. In the 38 years since Ebola was identified, we’ve had 25 outbreaks and they’ve all been contained fairly quickly. So what’s different this time? What’s different is it’s in some of the poorest countries whose infrastructure has been almost destroyed, and the international response was too slow. Again, you’ll be aware that in Nigeria, for example, and in Congo even, DRC even more interestingly, they had outbreaks as part of this which they controlled. So the Congolese doctors dealt with it by themselves without any international help. This international Ebola response was too late. EPA/Kirstin Palitza But in these three areas [Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia], I think the international help was late. Amongst other things, one of the reasons was when H1N1 was thought to be a pandemic, about two years ago, the WHO was considered to have overreacted: stockpiled drugs that weren’t necessarily the right ones and generally overreacted. I think on this occasion they’ve under-reacted, or slowly reacted, in part because they overreacted last time. They got heavily criticised. So there’s sort of no win here. So, anyway, they got it wrong, so people have gone in later. What is needed now is a massive input because the thing has got big and it’s massively important that it’s got on top of, partly – again, you’d know better than me – because there is the possibility of it mutating the longer it carries on and therefore it could become more dangerous. And, secondly, the impact, which is not just the impact of the deaths of Ebola. It’s the impact of the deaths on society, from everyone avoiding hospitals and dying of other things. It’s the impact of the farmers not planting their crops. It’s the impact on the economy and so on. So there’s a real need. I think two of the lessons that come out of this are, firstly, this is very connected with communities. It’s very connected with communal practices and cultural practices of washing bodies after death and these sort of things. This takes us back to the point that actually in a health system it needs to be built bottom-up. It needs to be built from community workers upwards. It needs to be about the paitent-empowerment type stuff Miriam Were was doing in 1976. And our support in the future for countries like Sierra Leone needs to recognise that health systems need to be strengthened in that way. And that means building local leadership and supporting local leadership. When it comes to the international response – and there needs to be international response – I think clearly there needs to be a rethink about what happened on that and particularly on a public health issue. I think we’re better at natural disasters – though this is a national disaster, I suppose – I think we’re better at earthquakes and things. Africa has 25% of the world’s disease burden. United Nations Photo/Flickr, CC BY-ND We need to have better ways of responding to public health crises. But I suspect there’s also need for an African response so that it is people with at least some potential local knowledge and so on who can work with local communities. Rob Moodie: I think you’ve raised a terrific point there. Colleagues have mentioned to me about the sort of response to date which has been a very medical, very military response to Ebola and has not really yet involved the community as we did with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. And I think we learnt a lot about the involvement of communities in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. Do you think that’s what we should be doing here? That sense of making sure the community is actually involved in the fight against Ebola? Nigel Crisp: I think so. I’m going to quote again a wonderful expression in the book from Miriam Were: If it doesn’t happen in the community, it doesn’t happen in the nation. That’s where you’ve got to start. There’s another great African quotation: Health is made at home, hospitals are for repairs. So both of them make the point that you’ve got to start where the people are. Start with their culture. Start with their understanding and work up from there. I think we need to do that. Now where Ebola is, you’ve got to involve the military, you’ve got to involve the clinical interventions, because it has gotten big and it’s out of control. Well, not necessarily out of control, it’s sort of coming into control and it will take some time to do that sort of response. The tragedy would be if we came away from this thinking that’s the sort of response we have to build up for the future. What you’ve got to build for the future is the resilience of the communities and an ability to respond as close to them as possible. Health systems need to be built from the bottom up. hdptcar/Flickr, CC BY Rob Moodie: Nigel, if I could get you to look at the future and the big challenges of health and health care in Africa. In your view, how are African nations going to balance this need to boost local health-care systems, their prevention systems, fight infectious disease and now pick up the battle against non-communicable diseases, like cancer and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. How do they manage these challenges? Nigel Crisp: Well, what we say in the book, and I defer here to the Africans and particularly my co-editor, Francis Omaswa, is the first thing the Africans need to get their act together, they need to be more confident. He’s got a wonderful quotation in the beginning of the book which is something like: when we Africans feel the sense of shame of our position, we will act. I think there is a big thing about Africans being self-confident enough to make things happen and not to be too dependent on the international community. So he sees that as a real starting point, and he can say that as an African and I can’t say it as a European. The second thing is that there will still need to be very substantial support from the west and the east, the richer countries of the world, and that needs to be done on the basis of what we call co-development: a recognition that it’s in my interests too to help you develop your health system and that I will learn stuff from you and you will learn stuff from me. Another great quotation is: everyone’s got something to teach and everyone’s got something to learn. I think there are all kinds of opportunities for us to be much more creative in the way in which we work in these countries. Just to take one is around staffing. You know the brain-drain issue of people having some level of health training and then leaving Africa and coming and living elsewhere (and this applies in other countries around the world). This is an important issue, but the even more important issue is that simply not enough people are being trained. Health is made at home and in the community. DFID - UK Department for International Development/Flickr, CC BY If every African who had ever left, having had some health training, went back, it would deal with about 10% of the problem. The numbers are roughly about 150,000 have left and you need about 1.5 million. Roughly speaking, that’s the shape of the figures. So that tells me two things. One is that we need to do much more to train more people, so I think part of our support can be that. But I would also put forward the proposition that maybe we should be training some of our people there. What would it be like if we actually had a year out of our training and had training in Africa? It would be a damn sight cheaper for us and what would be interesting is we would pay the university, you know you’d twin the university between Melbourne and Blantyre and you from Melbourne would get the cheaper deal for that second year and you’d be paying Blantyre. Rob Moodie: You might study in Malawi, that’s a great idea. Nigel Crisp: So there’s that sort of stuff that can change the nature of the relationship and then the third thing is actually what’s the vision here, because we’ve got the wrong vision in our country. From what I’ve read I think you and I probably have a similar vision. The future is about mobilising society to improve health. The great stuff in the UK of creating the NHS in 1948 was bringing together all the health systems – the private, public and everything – into a goal to improve health. What we’ve got to do now is to bring together all sectors of society that have an impact on health in order to improve health. I think the Africans can be a bit ahead of us and that’s why, again in that book, we talk about health being made at home and in the community. I think I read that you’ve written something similar to that, about having to counteract the forces in society that currently make people unhealthy. Rob Moodie: Yes, you’ve particularly got to watch what the tobacco companies, alcohol companies and junk food companies are doing in Africa as well, because they will somehow be driving these non-communicable diseases. Nigel Crisp: Well, they will do indeed. I think Africans can be ahead if they’re confident enough about not trying to copy us. Africa is a diverse region with different problems requiring different solutions. European Commission DG ECHO/Flickr, CC BY-ND Rob Moodie: Finally, if I can just mention we’ve been teaching and training hundreds of young African doctors here in our school of public health. A couple of young Ugandan doctors, who topped the subject I teach, have gone back to Kampala and there are 20 of them back there, a young generation. I have enormous confidence, I must admit, in the new generation of doctors and health leaders there. Is that what you sense as well? Nigel Crisp: I think so. Our book is about three generations. It’s the 80-year-olds who were there at the beginning of independence. It’s the three current ministers, well actually two - one’s lost her job - current leaders writing about stuff. And then we took the views of six younger future leaders. I think they’re all terrific, but this last group is the sort of people you’re talking about; they’re world citizens. But it’s patchy, Africa is 53 countries. I don’t know Malawi particularly well, but there’s not a huge strength in depth, I suspect, and I think one of the things we should be doing with our training is starting to build sufficient capacity. So if you’ve got 20 young doctors in Uganda who want to change the world, well they can do it. If you’ve only got two it’s a lot harder. So I think there is something about a minimum number, a critical mass is what I’m thinking of, and some countries are there or nearer there, I think. Uganda is interesting; they’ve got a doctor now who is prime minister and he’s very interested in all this, which I think is very encouraging. I’m moderately hopeful.

							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								The Trinidad-born Australian novelist Ralph de Boissière migrated to Melbourne in 1948 to escape Trinidad’s colour/class hierarchy. Breakdown Press Growing up with a Jamaican grandmother in 1970s small-town Australia was unusual. There weren’t any other Caribbean (or West Indian) people living nearby and a Caribbean community did not exist in Newcastle, New South Wales. When I interviewed members of the Caribbean community who migrated to Victoria from the 1960s to the 2000s for the book Adding Pimento: Caribbean Migration to Victoria, Australia (2014), co-edited by Lisa Montague and Pat Thomas, it put my grandmother’s migration into the socio-political context of the time. Adding Pimento (2014). Breakdown Press Remarkably, my grandmother had come to Australia on an assisted passage – for many years, only offered to people of European background – which she was able to successfully apply for in 1971 because she’d lived in London prior to migrating to Australia. By the 1970s she was a British citizen. She was also a fair Jamaican who emigrated to Australia because her daughter met and married an Australian. Caribbean people did come to live in Australia in the 19th century, mainly through the circuits of empire established by the British or because of the attraction of the Gold Rushes in NSW and Victoria. But their attempts to migrate were severely curtailed after the White Australia Policy was implemented in 1901. My grandmother was one of the very small group of Caribbean people who had been able to migrate to Australia before the official end of the White Australia Policy in 1973, either because of the colour of their skin or due to their citizenship and/or marital status. Assisted passage which was yet another way of trying to keep Australia “white”. The Trinidad-born Australian novelist Ralph de Boissière migrated to Melbourne in 1948 to escape Trinidad’s colour/class hierarchy, which exists as a legacy of slavery. In his autobiography, Life on the Edge (2010), de Boissière describes the “crippling sense of inferiority” experienced by Trinidadians and, by extension, all West Indians as a result of the colonial system. While de Boissière himself had no problem entering Australia in 1948, his wife Ivy and daughters Marcelle and Jacqueline were detained on board the ship while immigration officials decided if they would “fit in”. De Boissière reports that the family left the ship “feeling that we were tolerated migrants”. Charlie McKenzie migrated to Australia in 1974. Breakdown Press In the 1960s and 70s, the granting of Independence, and the rise of the Black Power movement prompted Caribbean migration to Australia. The influence of communism and socialism on Caribbean political leaders such as Cuba’s Fidel Castro, Jamaica’s Michael Manley, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Guyana">Guyana</a></span>’s Forbes Burnham and Grenada’s Maurice Bishop also played a part in migration. Historian Barry Higman claimed in 1976 that Australia was seen as a “haven”, particularly by white and fair West Indians who were fleeing these socio-political changes. Charlie McKenzie, a former sugar plantation owner from Barbados, decided to migrate to Australia in 1974 after Independence because: there was an undercurrent that I didn’t know anything about and I didn’t want any part of. McKenzie left an affluent lifestyle to resettle in Melbourne. Prior to arriving, Charlie thought he would work as a taxi driver because “the only thing I could do was drive a car”, but he ended up working in the public service. Tony and Schavana Phillips left <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Guyana">Guyana</a></span> in 1978 because of the increasing socialist orientation of the Burnham government. They felt that the changes that were taking place, such as compulsory military service for all young people, including women, and the restrictions on imports were making <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Guyana">Guyana</a></span> an uncomfortable place for themselves and their family members. Tony and Schvana Phillips on their wedding day. Breakdown Press In their story, Schavana says: The country was very dangerous to live in; also the economy of the country started to deteriorate … It was really a desperate situation. We made a decision to get out and we got out. The Phillips already had family living in Melbourne, which was the main draw-card for re-settling here. It is important to note that not all Caribbean people who came to Australia in the 1960s and 1970s, were fleeing the region because of these shifts in power and political ideology; nor do they necessarily share the same political views as those who did. Some saw Victoria as providing greater job opportunities, or they had family or marital ties here. But Australia was not the destination of choice for the majority of Caribbean people, because it was initially against their attempt to migrate. Instead they emigrated to the United States, Canada and the UK where there were and still are large Caribbean diasporic communities. After the White Australia Policy was abolished in 1973 more Caribbean people migrated to Australia but mainly because they had met and married Australians, or because they had chosen Australia for work and/or educational purposes. The Caribbean community in Victoria mainly comprises people (of many races and ethnicities) from the English-speaking or Commonwealth Caribbean, including some who identify as Black British of Caribbean descent. Like adding pimento to Caribbean food, the Caribbean community has added yet another layer to multicultural Victoria. Adding Pimento: Caribbean Migration to Victoria, Australia (2014) is released today, Monday December 8. CaribVic (the Caribbean Association of Australia) received a grant from the Victorian Multicultural Commission to publish Adding Pimento: Caribbean Migration to Victoria, Australia, of which I was an editor. I am also a member of CaribVic.

That global response saved millions of lives and encouraged international support to address other public health challenges, including malaria, family planning, and maternal and child health.

								If 2014 was the year that Apache Hadoop sparked the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> revolution, 2015 may be the year that Apache Spark supplants Hadoop with its superior capabilities for richer and more timely analysis. “There is a strong industry consensus that Spark is the way to go,” said Curt Monash, head of the IT analyst firm Monash Research. “Next year, you will see a lot of [Hadoop] use cases that transcend Hadoop,” said Ali Ghodsi, CEO and co-founder of Databricks, a company formed by a number of the creators of Spark that offers a hosted Spark service, as well as technical support for software distributors selling Spark packages. Spark is an engine for analyzing data stored across a cluster of computers. Like Hadoop, Spark can be used to examine data sets that are too large to fit into a traditional data warehouse or a relational database. Also like Hadoop, Spark can work on unstructured data, such as event logs, that hasn’t been formatted into database tables. To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here

								THIS year’s Christmas parade in Lindsay, in the heart of Oklahoma’s oil country, featured the Stars and Stripes every ten yards, 11 horses with riders in Santa hats and a rifle salute by veterans. But the highlight was a thundering, bright red oil tanker covered in fairy lights and owned by Hamm & Phillips, an oil-services firm with local roots that has ridden the shale boom in the state and across America.That energy revolution is the envy of the business world. Abundant oil and gas have been extracted from underground rocks by blasting them with a mixture of water, chemicals and sand—“<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>”, in the jargon. As well as festive spirit, the firms responsible embody an all-American formula of maverick engineers, bold entrepreneurs and risk-hungry capital markets that no country can match.Yet now that oil prices have fallen by almost 40% in six months, these firms’ mettle is being tested. Across America shale-shocked executives will spend Christmas overhauling their strategies to cope with life at $70 per barrel, even as investors dump their firms’ shares and bonds.

That, at least, is what some members of Switzerland’s right-wing People’s Party (SVP) would have you believe. Thanks to the SVP, Switzerland will vote on November 30th on a radical proposal to boost the central bank’s gold reserves. Bigger reserves, activists argue, will make the Swiss economy more stable and prosperous. In fact the opposite is true.SVP activists forced the referendum by collecting the necessary 100,000 signatures. They are annoyed at the behaviour over the past few years of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), Switzerland’s central bank. In the late 1990s it came to the conclusion that it held far too much gold. Its reserves were worth 25% of annual imports, while Germany’s were worth just 6%. The tumbling gold price at the time also made the hoard seem less sensible. By 2005 the SNB had sold half its gold—1,300 tonnes.The SNB then added insult to injury, by acquiring big reserves of a different sort.
