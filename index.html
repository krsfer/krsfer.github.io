                                Mobile Insider is delivered first thing every morning exclusively to BI Intelligence subscribers. SAMSUNG AS A PLATFORM: The Wall Street Journal reports that the Korean handset maker is officially hiring developers and engineers that will work on a proprietary Samsung mobile platform and related applications. One of the pioneering applications is its proprietary Milk Music streaming service. For now, the service is only available in the U.S. and on the Galaxy line of devices, but it has generated 380,000 downloads in a little over a month, according to Wonpyo Hong, president of Samsung's Media Solution Center. Hong spoke at length with The Wall Street Journal on connected cars, mapping software, and where it's partnership with Tizen fits into the picture. (Wall Street Journal) EXCLUSIVE GAMES: Apple and Google want to takeover one of the most lucrative markets in the mobile world: gaming. As we first reported yesterday, the two companies have allegedly been luring developers with exclusive deals that would ensure that popular games hit either of their respective app stores first. For the developers, the deals give their games a boost in app store rankings, allowing them to gain greater visibility. For Apple, securing exclusive deals with popular games helps it hammer home the idea that the App Store is better-stocked than Google Play.  Console-based gaming originally developed the idea of securing exclusive platform launches, but the concept is new to mobile gaming, the fastest-growing segment of the gaming industry.  All in all, independent game makers are the real losers here. These exclusive deals with large gaming companies cut off smaller game makers from space in the featured section of app stores. But the long-tail of mobile gaming money means indie games might fare better at the bottom of the market, anyway, thinks Keith Katz, CEO at mobile game incubator Execution Labs. "I think money is flowing down the charts,” Katz said to Re/Code, “And I don’t think that was always the case." (Wall Street Journal, Recode) QUOTE OF THE DAY — "There's an overarching architecture that I'd like the company to be known for in three to five years, ... which is called a machine-to-machine. Some people like to describe this as the Internet of Things or All Things Internet ... The device doesn't necessarily have to be a handset. But the devices could be anything out there. It could be your car, things in your house, and so forth. Everything gets connected. And we like to become a major hub of that." — BlackBerry CEO John Chen speaking to Maria Bartiromo of USA Today. (USA Today) APPLE NIXES CARRIER BILLING RUMORS: Reports of an Apple deal with China Mobile to charge for app purchases through users’ phone bills are not true, a company spokesperson tells us. Apple has long avoided carrier billing in favor of linked credit and debit card accounts, a strategy that has helped the company amass nearly 600 million cards on file and avoids splitting app sale proceeds with carriers. Apple's app revenue in China went up an estimated 70% last quarter, according to App Annie. The Apple spokesperson noted that app purchases in China are often confirmed through an SMS text, and said the carrier billing rumors might have arisen due to confusion over the feature. (Keith Griffith, BI Intelligence) COOLPAD LOOKS TO 4G: Chinese handset maker Coolpad has raised a $175 million round of funding that will be directed primarily toward boosting the company's 4G smartphone manufacturing operations, as well as helping push expansion outside of China. Nearly 95% of the 60 million 3G and 4G phones that Coolpad hopes to sell this year will be sold in China. (SCMP) iBEACON GAINS TRACTION, WITH POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT. Slowly but surely, Apple’s iBeacon appears to be gaining traction, a development with disruptive potential for the payments ecosystem. The technology, which uses battery-friendly Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and geofencing to detect nearby devices and exchange data with them, got a major boost with iOS 7.1, which quietly upgraded iBeacon to allow it to communicate with apps even when they’re closed. Last week, chip maker Texas Instruments announced that it would integrate iBeacon compatibility across its BLE product line, “enabling manufacturers to quickly add micro-locationing capabilities to their products.” By the end of 2014, over 30,000 retailers will have beacons installed, one study predicts. Beacons have the potential to disrupt on several fronts, and iBeacon is in pole position. We’ve estimated that there are over 200 million currently deployed iPhones and iPads capable of acting as or receiving signals from iBeacons. That kind of infrastructure could pave the way for a much-anticipated mobile payment app from Apple, which as we reported last week, could be based on a combination of near-field communication (NFC) and BLE. But PayPal is also racing to get its own beacons in the field. As PayPal CEO David Marcus noted on the company's blog last week: “The proliferation of BLE chips in devices will enable the industry to create very precise, fast, and secure shopping and payment experiences.” (BI Intelligence) DISPLAY PANEL REVENUE SHIFTS TO MOBILE: Revenue from mobile device display panels is expected to overtake revenue from LCD TV display panels for the first time this year. By the end of 2014, smartphone and tablet display panel sales will make up 42% of global panel display revenue compared to a 37% share for LCD TV panel sales. In total, display panel revenue will hit $131 billion this year. (DigiTimes) YAHOO'S MOCK KNOWLEDGE GRAPH: A website called All Google Testing has discovered that Yahoo is testing a desktop search results interface that looks highly similar to the results generated on Google from its Knowledge Graph algorithm. Yahoo has been making a big push lately to improve its search product; Yahoo even wants to oust Google as the primary search engine on iOS devices. (Search Engine Land) HTC NUMBERS: A Bloomberg feature revealed that last year's HTC flagship device, the HTC One, sold about 5 million units in its first two months. The Samsung Galaxy S4 sold 20 million over the same duration, and the iPhone 5 hit the 5 million mark in just three days. (Bloomberg) <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MESH NETWORKING">MESH NETWORKING</a></span>: The U.S. State Department provided $2.8 million to a team of American hackers in Tunisia so that they could develop a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mesh network">mesh network</a></span> that would allow the country's dissidents to communicate more freely and securely during a time of political unrest.

                                Among the many changes currently sweeping through US public universities is a move away from traditional seat-time in class. Known as “competency-based education”, it is often done online, asking students to demonstrate they can meet certain core skills or competencies. Its proponents offer it up as a cure to the ills that are allegedly facing higher education today, such as underprepared students, the “skills gap” and the general “academic drift” of the university. Those against it are worried the end result will be a university education that will be cheaper in all senses of the word, but also one that is highly stratified and unworthy of the label “higher education”. Recently the push towards competencies has become linked with a movement called the “college completion agenda, which seeks, in part, to allocate public funding to universities depending on how many students finish college. Advocates, including president Barack Obama, argue it is urgently needed to move more students through higher education. Quicker through the system The Gates Foundation and Complete College America claim the completion agenda is urgently needed to get people to finish their degree faster, cheaper and with less student loan debt. It is meant to increase jobs and spur innovation in the intensified competition of the global knowledge economy. Those in favour include a rather motley amalgamation of edu-metricians in fields such as educational psychology who have been dreaming about rationalising and standardising education since the days of American psychologist E.L. Thorndike. Joining them are a variety of neoliberal think thanks, such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, who have longed to turn the market loose on one of the last holdouts of the now greatly diminished public realm. Also in favour are philanthropic groups such as the Lumina and Gates Foundations that have essentially become political action committees by another name. Finally a host of edu-preneurial companies, such as Pearsons, Udacity and others, who are hoping to be on the ground floor of the “edu-metrics” and “credentials” market in the making. Alongside them are various business interests groups who want to avoid on-the-job training costs by capturing universities and turning them into large corporate training centres. They contend that if we could only precisely define what students need to know, it would be possible to accurately measure “learning outcomes” through standardised assessments rather than relying on time spent in class. Students could then move through these at whatever pace they choose. Cheap and substandard Those who oppose this model contend that this is not education at all but simply a cheap, substandard means of providing students with credentials. With these learning outcomes in place, a large data system could be used to move entire degree programs to a competency-based model where each student would be required to meet certain measurable competences as defined by the skills needs of a business. Government would come in to help mandate the partnerships working through the boards of various university systems. Adopting such an approach would allow education to become “personalised” as students check off various knowledge and skills and receive their credential or badge. Such a process can even be done with few or no professors, such as at online universities like Western Governors University (WGU), Southern <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> University’s “College for America” or Capella University’s “FlexPath”. Students, or “education pioneers” in Capella’s adventurous sounding euphemism, who “attend” these universities will then be responsible for navigating their way through these standardised competencies. The new job of professors in this model – or “course mentors” in the eduspeak of WGU – is to develop the standards and competencies and measure students, not necessarily to teach. Indeed, teaching has no real place in this model. While the completion agenda seems to have burst onto the US higher education scene only in the past few years, the move towards competencies and away from seat-time actually has rather deep roots. It dates back to the “behavioural objectives” push in teacher training programs in the US and in vocational training reforms the UK and Australia. Students at risk While the convergence of these two reforms in the US is relatively new, they have been fuelled by a third process that has been unfolding more slowly over the last few decades – the transformation of the student into the consumer. Because of the unrelenting pressures of market forces, these students will be solely responsible for assuming the risks of their own education. Here, education is viewed as an individual investment in a person’s own human capital rather than an expenditure by society for the collective good. The result of this transformation is the creation of a “scared straight” student consumer who is forced to live in constant fear of accruing large amounts of debt, selecting the most lucrative major and finding a good job. From the student’s vantage point anything that appears to “slow down” education is considered a “waste of time and money”. Today, public higher education in the US seems to be facing the proverbial perfect storm. Those pushing the completion agenda want to crank out new graduates as fast as possible to fill a skills gap that is actually a jobs gap. Ironically, the very processes that are thought to be finally bringing market discipline to what neoliberal reformers consider to be the much too public, public university will end up pricing those very reforms as “cut-rate merchandise”. Such a realisation may come too late to preserve public higher education in the US. As higher education systems around the world begin to converge around neoliberal models of reform and open up to more online and private forms of higher education, the US model may soon become a global exemplar. In the end these reforms may either privatise higher education completely or turn it into a self-funded servant of national economic and business interests that is public in name only. Steven C.

                                <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Gluten">Gluten</a></span> intolerance covers a range of gut problems caused by ingesting proteins found in wheat, barley, rye and in some cases, oats. The three main groups affected are those with a direct sensitivity to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>, coeliac disease and people who are allergic to wheat. Although symptoms can appear similar and the terms are often used interchangeably, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance isn’t the same as coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is a serious life-long autoimmune condition of the small intestine, in which the body’s immune system attacks itself when someone with the condition eats <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>. This damages the healthy lining of the small intestine and stops nutrients being absorbed from food. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Gluten">Gluten</a></span> intolerance is also a permanent condition that damages the small intestine every time <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> is consumed, regardless of whether symptoms are present or not, but it is unclear whether the immune system is involved. Identifying the active protein In 1887, British doctor Samuel Gee was the first to make a record of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance, which he described as a “malabsorption of ingested food” in children. Removal of wheat flour and wheat products from the diet was later seen to alleviate symptoms associated with the disease – and to this day a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> free diet is currently the only successful treatment. It was later found that a particular protein in wheat was active in patients with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance and could not be removed from the gut by digestive enzymes. Equivalent proteins in rye, barley and possibly oats were also found to cause problems. So foods and drinks containing malted grains and any processed foods that contain this protein have to be removed from the diet. The main cause of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance is genetics, and the specific genes associated with the condition have been isolated. The genes produce molecules that interact with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> proteins and activate the abnormal intestinal response. But not all people with the offending genes develop <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance, which suggests that other environmental factors are implicated. These could include early weaning onto solid food, breast feeding and gastrointestinal infection. Symptoms in untreated conditions can vary which can lead to delays in diagnosis. Symptoms vary from fatigue, headaches, abdominal complaints, diarrhoea, joint complaints to vitamin and mineral deficiencies, such as iron and calcium. Bones can become weak and brittle. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Gluten">Gluten</a></span> intolerance is also associated with other autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid and liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease. An increased risk of intestinal cancer is also associated with undiagnosed <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance. Neurological conditions are also associated with. How common is <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance? Over the past two decades the perception of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance has changed from being a rare disease that affects children of northern European ancestry, to a very common condition of people of all ages worldwide with 1.4 million Americans being diagnosed with the condition every year. The condition recently received high profile coverage in the media after a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free diet was shown to have improved the performances of top sports stars. Recent studies have shown the condition isn’t just confined to western countries or those of northern European descent – <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance, for example, is as common in the Middle East. Despite it now being seen as more common, the condition is under-diagnosed for a number of reasons. Often individuals display only mild symptoms, and even though new and more accurate techniques have been introduced diagnosis still depends on determining changes in cells lining the intestine. Because of this it often takes until adulthood to be diagnosed, in fact, more than 60% of newly diagnosed patients are adults, with 15–20% over 60 years of age. Food for thought The only known effective treatment for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance is a life-long <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free diet. But studies have shown that some groups, such as adolescents, find it difficult to keep off <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> products. Poor product information on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> containing foods is also be a problem for people on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> free diets, as is cross contamination when food is being made. Useful labelling isn’t always helpful because people differ in their sensitivity to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> so a particular dose may cause a response in one person, but not in another. The availability and price of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> free foods is another factor, often there are limited ranges and are considerably more expensive than conventional products. So in patients on a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free diet, intestinal damage can continue to happen even if in small increments, and may be outside the control of the person with the condition. The use of starches and gums is the most widespread for mimicking <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> when making <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free bakery products, because they have <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> like properties. Some on the milder end of the intolerance scale may not see that having some <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> every now and again is a problem, while for others it’s a battle to maintain a completely <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free diet. But the signs are things are getting better – both in terms of diagnosis and available foods on the market.

                                Most of us are only too aware of the seemingly intractable problems we’re facing within healthcare, education, community building, environmental sustainability and regional conflict. But could interactive games provide part of the solution? The organisers of the 11th annual Games for Change Festival in New York (April 22-26) seem to think so. In conjunction with the Tribeca Film Festival, the festival will unite game creators, policy makers and educators. “Gaming for social good” – the use of digital games or elements of games for non-entertainment purposes – is a large arena that includes serious games, game-based learning, games with a purpose and gamification (or game thinking and mechanics in a non-game context). Research from the last decade has shown that, in the right context, games can provide an effective and engaging medium that allows us to explore personal identity, actively participate in learning, build social connections and take part in problem solving and decision making in a “safe-fail” space. Well-designed social-good games can produce positive outcomes by tapping into our intrinsic motivations and positive emotions. There are games that tackle social issues, such as Darfur is Dying, which raises awareness on the plight of refugees in western Sudan; FreeRice, which provides a sponsorship platform for tackling world hunger; and RecycleBank, which encourages household recycling and waste reduction. Darfur is Dying. Screenshot The use of digital games for non-entertainment purposes is nothing new. Its origins can be traced back to the early 1950s with the introduction of the first computers, when chess and checkers were programmed as computer games by scientists to run research in computer science and artificial intelligence. But it was only when the the Cold War took hold that significant investment in digital games was made by the military to simulate war games for training and battle strategy evaluation. Today, outside of the military, investment in games for social impact are undertaken by universities, philanthropic foundations and governments in conjunction with private sector organisations, and supported by advocacy organisations such as Games for Change and Games for Health. In the healthcare sector, games have been used across diverse fields such as research, rehabilitation, medical treatment, education and training. And from these, the following are some pertinent examples. Health and wellness games Medical research The University of Washington developed the multi-player online puzzle game FoldIt in 2008, which focused players on predicting the behaviour patterns of protein structures with potential applications in the treatment of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> virus, cancer and Alzheimers disease. Screen shot of Foldit. Courtesy of University of Washington. billmcclair The problem of how to configure the structure of an enzyme, M-PMV retroviral protease – a challenge that had stumped scientists for 15 years – was solved in just 10 days after it was presented to 240,000 FoldIt players in 2011. This has been a keystone example of how the combination of a multiplayer games, crowd-sourcing and distributed computing can be used as a new and innovative form of collaborative research and problem solving. FoldIt spawned other medical and healthcare game projects, including cancer research with games such as the GeneGames, EteRNA, EyeWire and Phylo. Rehabilitation Videogames using virtual reality have been used in clinical trials for the rehabilitation of stroke patients to recover function in their disabled limbs. Both the Fruit Ninja game on Xbox Kinect and virtual tennis games on the Nintendo Wii platform were found to show significant benefit to patients and act as a good adjunct to conventional therapy. There are now several iPad game apps on the market designed to assist with rehabilitation, communication and emotion management, including a wide range of games for stroke patients. Medical treatment Various games have been used as assistive tools for patients to manage their illnesses (while collecting data at the same time to further medical research). The mobile game Pain Squad was developed to help young cancer patients record their pain levels, and Re-Mission was also aimed at young cancer patients to help them manage their condition better and encourage them to adhere to their treatments. Lymphoma mission on Re-Mission videogame. Healthcare games of this type been successful as they provide immediate feedback and visualisation of the patient’s condition in a novel, interactive and fun way. Most importantly (depending on the game, the illness and the individual) gameplay helps the patient feel empowered, and in control of a situation that more often than not makes them feel isolated, depressed and helpless. Many other games or gamified tools are used, such as Triage Simulator, for training medical practitioners on emergency response, and gamified mobile apps that focus on building exercise, diet, awareness of substance abuse and behaviour modification. Triage Trainer prototype. It’s still early days in the research and testing of games for social impact. Not all problems can be solved with a game-based solution, and any use of games must of course be undertaken as part of an integrated approach. But with increasing pressure on the health system, alongside greater focus on prevention and self-managed care, games are showing strong potential as an innovative source of cost-effective and accessible solutions – just as they are in many other areas of social concern.

                                The Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System, or AACUS for short, is a set of sensors and software developed by Near Earth Autonomy for remotely piloting military helicopters. The system essentially turns a pre-existing conventional helicopter into an unmanned <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> capable of being piloted and maneuvered via tablet. The value here is in safely dispatching supplies to troops in need and in evacuating wounded soldiers without risking the life of a pilot.  AACUS is dependent on a scanning laser rangefinder to detect obstacles and gauge distances. Its Lidar (remote sensing technology) unit scans forward in order to avoid obstacles while in flight, and it can angle directly downward to search for a safe landing area. The animation below shows actual data received by the AACUS sensors. The terrain is algorithmically sectioned off into areas that get a "grade" for landing quality. Red squares are "aborts" to be avoided. The green spots are identified as safe landing spots. After a brief training session with the tablet software, Marines without flight experience can become functional <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> pilots.

                                By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to turn over key portions of a memorandum justifying the government's targeted killing of people linked to terrorism, including Americans. In a case pitting executive power against the public's right to know what its government does, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling preserving the secrecy of the legal rationale for the killings, such as the death of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki in a 2011 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> strike in Yemen. Ruling for the New York Times, a unanimous three-judge panel said the government waived its right to secrecy by making repeated public statements justifying targeted killings. These included a Justice Department "white paper," as well as speeches or statements by officials like Attorney General Eric Holder and former Obama administration counterterrorism adviser John Brennan, endorsing the practice.

                                The idea of using satellites to monitor wildlife and biological diversity probably conjures up images of radio-collared deer or tagged turtles. And while these have been key to increasing our understanding of animal distribution worldwide, we can track a lot more from space than you’d imagine – and it’s not necessary to capture and fit a tracking device first. For example, hyperspectral sensors – which capture information across the electromagnetic spectrum in very narrow bands able to detect recognisable “fingerprints” of objects – have been used to determine genetic differences in Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen), one of the most widespread and genetically diverse species in North America. Satellite information on climatic conditions and on vegetation type and dynamics can help predict animal movement and condition. These are just two examples taken from a special edition I co-edited on satellites and conservation in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B journal. Who is interested in satellite remote sensing? Basically anyone who seeks to understand large scale patterns in biodiversity distribution, or that has to deal with the management of big, remote, or inaccessible areas. An unparalleled view from above The level of information that can be derived from satellite data is pretty phenomenal, and too-often undervalued by ecologists and conservationists. For example, emperor penguin colonies can be found and the colony size estimated using very high resolution images. Changes to the extent or density of ecosystems can be tracked, and active sensors such as radar and lidar can report the 3D structure and density of vegetation. Just how “green” our world is can be extensively mapped on a fortnightly basis. So satellites help monitor both wildlife and vegetation in the natural world, able to provide information about the most remote and inaccessible places on Earth. They also capture information that helps us understand why, and predict where, biodiversity is declining. For example, measurements taken on the ground can be integrated with satellite data to track the current distributions of certain invasive species, and to predict their projected advance. High resolution images can be used to map problems associated with oil exploration and exploitation. The response of animals to shifts in temperatures or availability in food and resources can be analysed and predicted from satellite-based information. And deforestation, land degradation and the fragmentation of ecosystems as well as the expansion of urban areas have all been successfully monitored using satellites' unique viewpoint. Satellites' benefits extend beyond land to the oceans too, as there are some great examples of how satellites can support marine conservation. Spotting and monitoring oil spills is a classic example, using radar or infrared sensors. And using satellite data together with that from vessels' monitoring systems make it easier to detect illegal, undeclared or unreported fishing. Key new technologies need to be used Remote sensing is becoming central to our ability to understand and manage the natural world. From camera traps and microphone arrays, to guided <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> and Doppler radar, ecologists, conservationists and environmental or wildlife managers have been drawn towards new technological developments that provide the possibility of non-invasive monitoring. Satellite sensors are part of this incredibly powerful toolkit, and their scope to inform research and support resource management is continuously growing. For example, satellite data is now used to inform protected area management or species reintroduction programs. Perhaps obviously, the best uses for this technology and major breakthroughs are most likely to occur when remote sensing and conservation experts collaborate; yet this happens all too rarely. Conservationists and wildlife managers need better links to technical expertise and access to equipment, and working together would be greatly enhanced by common information-sharing platforms and the development of a more coordinated research agenda. Google Earth is one thing, but making government-funded satellite data and the software tools to use it freely accessible would be a key step to increase the number of new purposes the research community can put it to.

                                Most people who think they have the flu, don’t. And some people who think they have a cold, really have the flu. So what is the difference between a cold and the flu? And does it matter? A cold is a mild illness that resolves without treatment. It is a combination of some or all of the following: sneezing, a runny and then blocked nose, a sore or scratchy throat, cough, low-grade fever, headache and malaise. Doctors often refer to a cold as an upper respiratory tract infection or URTI (pronounced er-tee). They are very common – on average, you can expect three per year. There are at least 200 different viral subtypes that cause colds – the commonest by far are rhinoviruses which are responsible for at least 40%; others include <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus">coronavirus</a></span>es, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses. Following a cold, the small airways in the lungs become “hyper-reactive”. This can trigger an asthma attack and may result in the so-called “post-viral cough” that lasts for weeks. (In this setting, whooping cough should also be considered). A cold may be complicated by an ear infection and sinusitis – both of which are usually viral and do not require antibiotics. By definition, “the flu” is an illness caused by an influenza virus. True flu is much less common than a cold and can be a more severe disease – the nasal symptoms are absent but sore throat may be present. You’re likely to be much sicker and have high fever, chills, shaking, severe muscle aches, malaise, headache and a cough. Influenza is a much more serious virus. Shutterstock Influenza may progress to pneumonia and, in the elderly and those with particular chronic conditions, the risk of death is substantial. When a pandemic strain of influenza appears, the mortality in otherwise healthy people may be significant. The problem is that many people who have some or all of the symptoms of influenza are not infected with an influenza virus but rather with one of the cold viruses – we call these illnesses “flu-like”. Many people who thought they had influenza in the past will have just had a severe cold (sometimes referred to by female partners as “man flu”). Occasionally, someone with symptoms of a cold will actually be infected with an influenza virus. To add even more complexity, studies of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic show that the majority of people who were infected had no symptoms. It is not easy to identify the cause of your cold or flu-like illness. Current diagnostic testing is usually limited to patients who require hospital admission. And even then, we don’t find a definitive answer in most people. Most colds and flus are transmitted by touching the nasal secretions of an infected person and then touching your own nose or eye. The incubation period is usually one to three days and you are most infectious for about five days from the onset of symptoms. Flu Attack! How a Virus Invades Your Body Frequent hand hygiene (washing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub) will reduce your risk of infection. Masks, a common sight in Asia, have been shown to be useless at preventing transmission. The typical cold lasts between three and ten days but 25% persist for more than ten days. The persistence of symptoms often results in people inappropriately seeking antibiotics from their doctor. You can treat the symptoms of a cold with nasal decongestants and drugs such as aspirin and paracetamol but none shorten the infection. There are countless unproven claims for herbs, vitamins and minerals in the treatment of colds. In a salutary lesson that “natural” is not always safer, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2009 warned against the use of zinc-containing products in nasal sprays, including homeopathic preparations, because they were associated with a risk of permanent loss of smell. The 2014 flu vaccine protects against three strains, including H1N1-like strain. Daniel Paquet, CC BY There is no vaccine for the common cold – it is impossible to make one that can cover so many different viruses. Influenza has a seasonal vaccine that targets the most common subtypes circulating in the community but it is not 100% protective. The antiviral drugs that work against influenza – Relenza (zanamivir) and Tamiflu (oseltamivir) – reduce the duration of symptoms by just over a day on average. So, most of us are wrong when we think we have the flu. But if you were to tell the boss that your recent absence was due to “acute coryzal rhinopharyngitis”, you may get more sympathy than by just giving her the cold facts.

                                Guest author Matthew Brian Beck is a journalist and advertising strategist based in New York City. The next big thing is getting smaller and smaller. Historically, our social media experience has been chained to the first-screen browser and the one News Feed to rule them all. We've been saturated with bloated content from overpopulated streams. We've been bombarded with updates and notifications from friends and family we love, pages we Like, accounts we follow, colleagues we connect with, and acquaintances that can't even remember where we knew them from—we just couldn't keep up. We felt an impulsive urge to clean house, to make our feeds less cluttered and more manageable. But as our daily Internet consumption moves away from the desktop (and even the laptop), the landscape of social media is seeing a dramatic shift in native platforms and user behaviors. Smartphone hardware has matured. Wireless data networks have advanced. Mobile-first design has gone mainstream. But content oversaturation and deterioration of meaningful interactions is still a concern. That problematic intersection has birthed a new zeitgeist: Mobile tribes. We crave interpersonal interaction, the basic human need to connect and communicate with each other. The basal layer of social media has remained unchanged, but the chief characteristic of tribes is the tendency to categorize membership in distinct groups, movements, cultures and ideologies—to band together in subpopulations of shared interests, tastes, demographics and marketplaces. Yet, within tribes is the free will to exercise personal choice over who we connect and communicate with. That's where mobile comes in. The Age Of The Mega Platform Is Over In the post-PC era, we're increasingly finding content and connections exclusively on our phones. The first generation of social media touted "networking", but the next generation, raised in always-on connectivity, will embrace ephemerality and digital tribalism. Those users will abandon the major social networks and migrate to more granular mobile villages with simpler ecosystems. They will follow a small circle of close friends on Instagram, pin with a small handful of followers on Pinterest, message with a girlfriend or schoolmate on WhatsApp or Snapchat, or follow a co-worker's check-ins on Foursquare. Or, they will build the next platforms and apps that don't exist yet. Every platform will be socialized, but every user base will be judged on quality of life, not sheer numbers. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big data">Big data</a></span> will not matter as much as small relationships. Media and content will become less fragmented and centralized, more native and branded to the single-channel niche apps they appear in and the mobile tribes they appeal to. Even Facebook, the big-box chain of social networking, realizes its problem of content oversaturation and the trend towards granularity and mobile tribes. The company has doubled down on developing its mobile suite (where most of the company’s active power users live, and where the ad dollars are most brisk) and "unbundling the big blue app," according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. "I think on mobile, people want different things," Zuckerberg told The New York Times. "Ease of access is so important. So is having the ability to control which things you can get notifications for. And the real estate is so small. In mobile, there's a big premium on creating single-purpose first-class experiences." Brands, companies and startups that build social products, services and devices must build for app-only tribes in the future. They must think like the end user, one that has always grown up with a smartphone and a few favorite apps. These new platforms will be connected for (and by) app-only mobile natives—carefully curated and tightly managed for the community, but also streamlined for productivity and responsiveness. They must know and respect the user, and his or her mobile tribe. Because on the Internet, there's just too much stuff to see, people to meet, food to Instagram, and not nearly enough time for it all.

                                I’m a music junkie. Like many of you, my life is often accompanied by a soundtrack. I’ve got playlists for working out, and just plain working. Music for when I’m feeling on top of the world, and music for when I'm down in the gutter. Songs that make me think, and songs that bring back memories. Music is important to me—and probably to you as well. But despite the importance of music, technology is really what allows it to be such a huge part of our lives. So how is tech going to shape the future for music fans like me and you? I needed to find out. I connected with the band Switchfoot—known for the songs "Meant To Live" and "Dare You To Move"—to see if and how they are embracing technology to make their music more enjoyable to fans. What I found is that they're using tech to give their fans more: More access, more content and more control. This isn’t a story about artists making more money. It’s a glimpse into what the future has in store for people who love music. People like you and me. Why Switchfoot? There’s no scientific reason for the choice. I wanted to pick an artist, so I picked one I was a fan of. As it turned out, the way these guys use technology to connect with their followers probably represents a decent cross-section of how artists in general are using tech to engage with fans. Switchfoot has a wide range of experiences that makes it a worthy envoy: The band has been independent, it's been signed to a major label and it's won a Grammy. Within minutes of our first conversation, I could tell this band was using technology in innovative ways—especially to create closer connections with fans. According to Switchfoot’s bass player Tim Foreman (who majored in computer science and handled the band’s early Web development) the band’s music—and it’s use of technology—is all about connectivity. “We’re part of this greater creative community that includes our fans," Foreman said. "We want to make them co-conspirators with us. They’re just as much a part of this as we are. For us as a band, it’s all about the conversation, and to that end we’re always looking to eliminate barriers between us and the people that listen to our music.” Building Bridges RebelMouse is a tool Switchfoot uses to simultaneously break down barriers and fuel the conversation. Implemented on one of the band’s websites, FadingWest.tv, RebelMouse pulls together tweets, Instagram photos and videos into a single unified hub. As social as social media is, not every fan has an account on every platform. With RebelMouse, fans on one network but not another—Twitter, but not Instagram, or vise-versa—suddenly have access to a treasure trove of content. As empowering as the band’s social media strategy is, Switchfoot has gone even further to include fans in its journey—literally. Switchfoot has used services like WeDemand! to give fans a chance to help shape the touring schedule. WeDemand! works by allowing fans to raise social support for bringing their favorite artists to areas that may normally be overlooked. Aside from demanding a show, fans can also leave comments for the band on the site. A glance at the band’s WeDemand! page shows a large group of commenters requesting a show in Omaha. See also: Can Technology Predict The Grammys? Band-to-fan communication is commonplace in the music industry, but fan-to-band communication is finally becoming more common. Switchfoot has also tried to encourage and enable fan-to-fan communication as well: When group messaging service GroupMe was brand new, the band encouraged fans that purchased tickets to download the app in order to communicate with each other while attending concerts and festivals. A messaging app may not sound like the type of tech a band would be on the lookout for—and in truth, it isn’t always a natural fit—but Switchfoot is always looking for benefits that aren’t necessarily obvious. “One of the interesting things I’ve discovered is that many times the primary use of technologies or services is not actually the primary benefit for us," Foreman said. "For instance, we’ve used LivingSocial to promote some of our album and tour stuff. Most people are just focused on the sales numbers, but for us, that’s not really the main equation there. What’s often overlooked is the fact that they have this huge mailing list. So whether you sell 100 or 10,000 tickets, you’re reaching millions of eyeballs. I think a lot of technology and services out there have a second layer that is beneficial but often overlooked.” Some services do offer obvious benefits, and the band has those covered, too. Will Call is an app that offers fans a better concert experience by helping them coordinate with other friends at the show, buy merch from their phones without having to face frenzied crowds, and even discover more concerts to attend. Switchfoot has been an early adopter of the Will Call service, which is currently only available in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. An Organized Strategy Switchfoot doesn’t just stumble across new technology and decide to use it willy-nilly. Bruce Flohr, the band’s manager and an executive at Red Light Management, is dedicated to finding new tech that fits with the band’s desires to connect with fans. So what’s his strategy? Flohr says he’s not just looking for the next Snapchat or Twitter. “We’re trying to find things that make sense for our fans," he said. "We look at things that fit into our fan’s lifestyle and try to work with technologies in that space.” Flohr said it all comes down to one simple test: “The first question I ask is, ‘Would I use this?’ Because if it’s too complicated, then it’s very hard to get the early adopters on board.” One piece of technology that passed Bruce’s test was Square, the payment platform led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. At Switchfoot’s latest BroAm charity surf event in San Diego, volunteers were sent out with Square-equipped iPads to collect donations from the crowd of 11,000 people. Though Square made it easy to collect donations for the band, the iPad has become instrumental for Switchfoot in other ways, including the way the band records. “The iPad has become this incredible multi-instrument that let’s you do things that aren’t possible any other way,” Foreman said. “It’s exciting. Just the tactile nature of the iPad allows you to play certain instruments that don’t exist. You can sample things and manipulate them in ways you couldn’t otherwise and we did a lot of that on the new record.” Foreman said many musicians tend to favor old gear like amps and guitars, but the bassist insisted Switchfoot enjoys exploring new tech. “I think it’s exciting to kind of let go of that for a second and be freed of those constraints and look at everything as an instrument and a possibility,” Foreman said. The Internet Isn't Always Friendly There have been times when technology has gotten in the way of the band’s connectivity to its fans. About 10 years ago when the band was signed with Columbia Records, the label was experimenting with copy protection. One of the band’s albums—Nothing Is Sound, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart—was included in the experiment… without the guys' prior knowledge. Foreman explains: See also: 10 Music Services You May Not Know About—But Should “We got our copy of the album a couple of days before it was released to the public and saw this big disclaimer on the back and found out that it had this protection that didn’t allow you to put it on your iPod (which at the time was already a huge deal). And we were just so offended that they would put out this message that basically tells our fans that we don’t trust them. We felt it was the most disingenuous thing that could possibly be put on our album.” At that point, Foreman's background in computer science kicked in and he posted a hack on the band’s message boards to let fans circumvent the copy protection to “use the music they purchased and owned how they wanted.” According to Wikipedia, the workaround was quickly deleted by Sony. Giving Fans What They Want By now you’ve probably picked up on an emerging theme. We’ve already seen how the band has used services like RebelMouse to surface and amplify fan-generated content, but technology is also allowing the band to produce more content themselves. In the future, harnessing, organizing and interpreting community information will help the band determine what kind of content to produce. See also: How To Stream Music With Google Chromecast “Data can help the band give the consumer what they want," Flohr said. "More and more we’re finding they might not want an entire album’s worth of material once every two years. They may want more material sooner and better experiences on the live side.” Did you glaze over that last statement or did it sink all the way in? Because it’s important. You, me, us, as music fans—we may be literally shaping what our favorite artists will produce in the future. We, the consumers, are really the ones being empowered, thanks to all of this technology. The future of being a music fan is sounding pretty good right now, but it’s also looking better visually thanks to the welcome onslaught of quality video content heading our way. It’s only natural: As the makers of our devices and the networks that connect them build their pipes to be larger and more connected, there will only be more demand for water ("content"). Water, Water, Everywhere There are plenty of ways fans can get extra content these days, especially with all the "behind-the-scenes" goodies out there. Flohr told me how music fans can use services like SoundHound to ID songs and unlock second-screen experiences with exclusive video content from the band. There's GoPro footage taken on-stage, brief five-minute video podcasts with tour updates, and even webcam setups in recording studios—Switchfoot has kept busy producing this video content, and last year, it even made a feature-length film to accompany the band's latest album. The two projects share the same name: Fading West. The Fading West movie is a chance for fans to further immerse in the band’s story. “The smart artists realize that they are storytellers and Switchfoot is a perfect example of that,” Flohr said. “Fading West is not a music documentary, it’s not a concert film. It’s a story of the band’s passion of both music and surfing and how they’ve been able to incorporate both into their lives and how both have influenced their career.” The film adds new depth to the group’s music and history, but after I watched it, I also felt like I’d gotten to know new friends. The film made me laugh, it made me sad, and it showed me things I didn’t expect to see. In short, it was great content. Content that my device—and inner fan—both craved. Content I’d like more of. (Fortunately for me, the YouTube lifestyle network focused on extreme sports called "Network A" partnered with Switchfoot to release some exclusive behind-the-scenes footage.) Switchfoot's movie—and the pipes that allow it to be delivered to new and existing fans around the world—have gone a long way toward helping the band’s fans feel more connected to the group. “I feel like the sense of community at our shows has never been greater because of the film,” Foreman said. “I feel like we were really vulnerable and honest in it and showed a different side of ourselves that people hadn’t seen. And I think letting people in on that just kind of furthers that sense of community. It adds to the intrigue and brings people along with us.” The Great Frontier I was a bit surprised to discover Switchfoot isn’t just using technology; the band is helping drive its development, too. While the band hasn’t built any tech tools from scratch yet and probably won’t fund any new products angel investor-style, Flohr said he “could see the band developing new technology in partnership with a tech company where they help as early adopters and by doing R&D... And it would not surprise me if what they helped develop was not necessarily IP but maybe hardware.” There’s a good chance your favorite artists will use some of these same tools and community-building techniques to engage fans as well, if they aren’t already. “It’s like anything,” Flohr said. “Good ideas get repeated over and over again. Even though you might be first to market with technology, if it works you open the floodgates.” So what kind of technology is the band looking into adopting next? “We’re looking into [<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>]," Foreman said. "I like the idea of straight peer-to-peer interaction. I think that’s something we’ve tried to do whether it’s online or offline—you know, like hanging out with kids after the show. It’s kind of the same concept of trying to eliminate barriers.” Music will always be about bringing people together, but it's clear that technology’s role will only help to amplify these community conversations to drive more—and better—content. And that's something anyone can nod their head to. Images courtesy of Shutterstock; Switchfoot images by Chris Burkhard

                                Easter Sunday will mark the fourth anniversary of the BP oil well blowout in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven workers on the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform died and almost five million barrels of oil poured into the Gulf from the Macondo well for 87 days. Yet the worst environmental disaster in US history failed to trigger any changes by the US Congress in safety or environmental laws offshore. Drilling activity in the gulf today surpasses that in April 2010. It is time to ask: is drilling in the Gulf any safer now than it was before the disaster? The question calls to mind the quip of a popular Russian comedian after the fall of the Soviet Union: “Much has changed, but nothing has happened. Or is it that much has happened but nothing has changed?” Much has certainly happened. New entities, and acronyms, exist, some created literally overnight in the wake of the disaster: BSEE, BOEM, COS, MWCC, and a just-born OESI now dot the landscape. And we have certainly seen a tsunami of innovation. There are new capping stacks for subsea intervention and containment, better blowout preventers tested in better labs, better clean-up techniques, advanced <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> and sensors to monitor underwater conditions in real-time, and better algorithms in software programs. Operators can now bring pre-positioned capping stacks to the scene of a blowout in days, not weeks. BP can pack a containment device into seven large planes and fly it anywhere in the world. There has also been a painful recognition that complacency is negligence. Industry and government both assumed that because no Deepwater Horizon-style disaster had previously occurred in the Gulf, all was fine. Yet, this very complacency is a root cause of accidents, as experts in safety management know. After a frightening event, stronger safety controls are heeded for a time, but then time dims the memory and corners are cut without obvious consequences. Complacency sets in and the system drifts into an unsafe state. A major role for the offshore regulator is to prevent this drift. And we finally saw the adoption of a Safety and Environmental Management System (SEMS) requirement as a new regulation offshore, after industry lobbying had previously delayed its arrival. The SEMS rule is the mechanism to prevent workers and management from becoming complacent. It institutionalises the planning, procedures and training that keep safety always in mind. Who audits the auditor’s auditor? Much has happened, indeed. But has there been real change so that offshore operations in the Gulf are genuinely safer? For a start, the US regime does not require that operators' safety plans be approved by the new regulator, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), before the operator receives a permit to drill. And the regulator is not an independent agency free from the politics which plagued its predecessor. Without an effective regulator that can check whether companies are sticking to their safety plans, the regime seems to be nothing more than prescriptive paperwork that must be shown to the regulator on demand, if it asks. The offshore regulator is now two-and-a-half years old, with safety as its primary focus. Its predecessor agency was starved of funds for years while operators pushed the offshore frontier into deep water, and the new bureau too lacks the experienced, professional and technical staff it needs to oversee offshore operations. Its own website acknowledges that the agency must undergo a total human capital transformation before it can perform its tasks adequately. This means that in many ways, the leading role in new safety measures in the Gulf has been taken by the Center for Offshore Safety (COS), a body created by the large operators in the Gulf in early 2011. Its stated mission is to “promote the highest level of safety” for offshore operations through “leadership and effective management systems”. The body is part of the API petroleum industry trade association, which also, of course, lobbies for lower taxes and less regulation. The Center for Offshore Safety aims to improve the industry’s safety record by helping members develop those new safety programs and by building a process for auditors to rigorously assess them. The theory is that well-trained third-party auditors will spot bad performers and the industry will be protected against a “rogue” company whose sloppy safety practices could lead to another disaster – and more drilling bans. The COS will also analyse aggregated audit data to see where its members are having the most problems conforming to new requirements and can also use the data to benchmark the safety performance of its members. It is worth noting that the data and analysis are the property of the industry association and may not be released to the public without its approval. James Watson, the first director of the government regulatory bureau, characterised this new offshore safety regime as “an operator-driven safety program with BSEE oversight”. And it is true that the auditing system in use in the US today is almost wholly a construct of the offshore industry itself. The Center for Offshore Safety has been and still is the dominant player in raising safety standards offshore. The regulator’s only formal link to the center is that it “approves” it to accredit the third-party auditors, the companies which perform offshore safety audits for operators, much like Ernst & Young performs financial audits for clients. In other words, the regulatory framework looks like “industry self-regulation through third-party audits”. The system can be simultaneously criticised for allowing too much industry self-regulation and for allowing operators to outsource their safety audits to third-party consultants rather than developing their own capability to do it alongside an embedded safety culture. Steep learning curve The toddler-aged government regulator does not pay for the audits and does not have to hire or retrain personnel to conduct them. This leaves the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement outside the “learning loop”. Its employees will not gain expertise in understanding the industry’s problems and how the regulations work in practice. Clearly, to earn public confidence in this system, the bureau must learn to “audit the auditor’s auditor”, that is, to audit how COS is auditing the third-party audit service companies that COS accredits after BSEE has accredited COS. (Did you get that?) That’s not to say their interests aren’t aligned. Suppose an offshore deepwater operator receives a prized safety certificate from the industry-run Center for Offshore Safety as a sort of “Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval”. Suppose, then, that this operator suffers an incident like the Deepwater Horizon blowout. Will the COS be in the hot seat at Congressional hearings as the dominant player in the offshore safety regime? Or will the government bureau be faulted as having allowed regulation to be outsourced to the industry’s own body and to third-party companies? Both are at risk. It will clearly take a number of years for the new bureau to be an effective regulator. And there are some critical tasks that it must learn to meet the standards of experienced UK and Norwegian regulators in the North Sea. It has been given a “trusted agent” to advise it in its tasks. Meet the just-born OESI, the Offshore Energy Safety Institute. It is a consortium of three universities (including the University of Houston) whose academic experts can help the regulator learn a host of tasks, including becoming a data-rich agency with the ability to crunch the numbers, spot trends and assess risk. Until the regulator can do this, and report it to the public, we cannot know whether the Gulf of Mexico is really safer in the coming years as massive BP spill fades from memory. An under-resourced regulator is not a trivial safety risk for industry. The European trade association (OGP) has warned its members that if a regulator is not providing robust oversight, then: An important piece of the technical assurance process may be missing. This is a ‘weak signal’ that should lead the OGP member to carry out a more extensive self-audit to compensate for the lack of competent oversight. Message to US politicians and industry lobbyists: pay heed to the “weak signals” that you create when an anti-government ideology trumps sound regulation. A good regulator is industry’s best friend. And that is the ultimate lesson of the Deepwater Horizon, four years out.

Like Google’s new <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, which can reach impressive heights, tech shares soared in the early part of this year. Then in March a sell-off began that battered the stocks of many Silicon Valley stars. The tech-heavy NASDAQ stockmarket index steadied somewhat early this week, and shares in older tech firms like HP and IBM, which are traded on the main market, have done well. But investors and companies are still jittery.Those worried that a new internet bubble pumped up by wild dreams and unabashed greed is now deflating will be watching closely to see whether tech firms’ latest results give further cause for alarm. On April 15th Yahoo published its quarterly earnings, which showed a tiny increase in revenue after excluding the cost of fees paid to its partner websites. Its shares rose on the news. Google was due to report its results the next day, after The Economist went to press.It is not just web firms whose performance is under the microscope. Shares in biotech companies, which adapt and exploit processes found in living organisms to create drugs and other useful products, have also taken a beating. Having risen by 60% last year, the NASDAQ biotech...

But the models may hide rather than reveal the deepest sources of social ills. In 1969, Playboy published a long, freewheeling interview with Marshall McLuhan in which the media theorist and sixties icon sketched a portrait of the future that was at once seductive and repellent. Noting the ability of digital computers to analyze data and communicate messages, he predicted that the machines eventually would be deployed to fine-tune society’s workings. “The computer can be used to direct a network of global thermostats to pattern life in ways that will optimize human awareness,” he said. “Already, it’s technologically feasible to employ the computer to program societies in beneficial ways.” He acknowledged that such centralized control raised the specter of “brainwashing, or far worse,” but he stressed that “the programming of societies could actually be conducted quite constructively and humanistically.”

                                The news: China's pollution problem has become rather infamous, as viral photos and marketing stunts can attest. But according to a new study, whatever happens in China doesn't stay in China. Published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a new study examines how pollution from East Asia affects the global atmospheres. Specifically, the researchers focused on aerosol pollutants such as sulfates emitted by coal plants, as well as pollutants from vehicular and other industrial activity. What they found was a strong correlation between Asian pollution and irregular weather patterns across the rest of the world, namely in the Pacific. Though the full implications of this yet to be understood, "it's almost certain that weather in the U.S. is changing," said Renyi Zhang, a co-author of the study. How aerosol pollutants work: Aerosols are tiny particles suspended in the air. Read More

                                NOT so long ago, China looked to be the promised land for crypto-currencies. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and its rivals were traded freely and online exchanges proliferated. On one estimate, China accounted for more than half of the world’s trade in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> last year. Near the end of last year, when its price was above $1,000, more than 100,000 coins were being traded daily on BTC China, a local exchange.Alas, those heady days are gone. Prices have plunged below $500 of late and hardly 2,000 coins are now traded daily on BTC China. According to Bobby Lee, the exchange’s founder, “Most investors have left the market.” What happened? The short answer is regulation.In early December China’s central bank declared that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was not a currency. This slowed its rise, but enthusiasts remained unbowed as the declaration fell far short of the outright ban some had feared. Then regulators forbade the firms that act as middlemen between businesses and credit-card networks from working with the exchanges. That was a more serious blow, but exchange operators found ways round the ban (for example, by using related companies to deal with the payment processors).Rumours now suggest that the...

                                In countries that have based their wealth on production, every discovery and innovation that potentially lower production costs attract very strong attention. Since 2007, the discovery and exploitation of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil have put the USA energy industry back on the track to competitive procurement faced with competing nations who have been low costs champions for decades. The new question on the table is to ascertain whether 3D printing can have a comparable impact. [This is a content summary only.

                                It's understood, the twenty-first century will be the century of robots. And there is a lot of talk concerning a subfamily of these machines: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>.

The company in question is Titan Aerospace, which manufactures what it calls "atmospheric satellites."

Mt Gox is a Tokyo-based business founded in 2009 as a trading card exchange (Source: wikipedia.org ).
