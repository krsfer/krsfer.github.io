                                It took Fred Wilson 10 years to become what he calls a “half-way decent” venture capitalist. It took him 20 to become a startup legend. Lately, rumors have swirled that the Zynga, Tumblr and Twitter investor might step away from the firm he co-founded, Union Square Ventures, and retire. The 52-year-old investor has written about his post-Union Square Ventures plans on his popular blog, A VC. “My daughter Emily asked what I plan to do when I retire in the next ten or fifteen years,” Wilson wrote in December. “I replied that ‘I plan to do what Mom does (angel investing)’. It looks like a lot of fun and I think I might be pretty good at it.” As Wilson wrote, he doesn’t plan to retire in the next few years. But stepping away from his day-to-day role at Union Square Ventures has crossed his mind. The firm, which was founded in 2003 by Wilson and Brad Burnham, has been grooming successors for the initial partners with more recent hires such as former Delicious President Albert Wenger and Betaworks Co-founder Andy Weissman. A few weeks ago, we had an hour-long conversation with Wilson about his career, the New York tech scene, and what will happen when, inevitably, Wilson decides his venture capital days are over. The interview was intended for a longer piece on the New York venture community, but the transcription was so compelling, we asked Wilson if he'd mind us publishing the full interview instead. Here are the topics we covered (it gets really good half way down, when he starts talking about why 2012 was a difficult year) Why 20-somethings are starting funds straight out of school, and how the investing industry is changing What investments Fred has personally made in the last few years, and what USV's thesis is Who some of the rising VC stars in New York tech are right now What Fred does when he feels uninspired at work How he handles investments that aren't going to pan out, plus what happened to Turntable and Brewster Why Tumblr's sale didn't feel like a major win for New York tech Why the New York tech scene has seen better days Fred's retirement plans Below is the lightly edited Q&A with Fred Wilson: BUSINESS INSIDER: What’s happening to the world of venture capital? Tools like AngelList make it easier to find deals. Young people are going out and raising funds. Is the industry changing? FRED WILSON: For somebody who has spent a decade doing venture capital at a big firm to leave and start their own firm, that’s kind of always been the way the venture capital industry has worked. I’m seeing a lot of it even right now, this year. Not in New York as much. But certainly a lot of it is going on in Silicon Valley where partners who are in their late 30s or early 40s are departing the more established, bigger firms and starting new firms. The reason that’s a pretty good model is because they have been doing venture long enough that they understand how it all works and they go and raise a fund and they put their name on the door. Generally speaking, those funds perform well because you don’t have a legacy portfolio so you’re just working on the new stuff. If the world’s changing and a new thing is coming, you can get on that more quickly sometimes than other people can. It’s a tried and true mechanism to create new blood, energy and creativity in the venture business. I think that’s something we’ll continue to see happen. Then, you have these other things you mentioned, like AngelList and a lot more angel investing and seed investing activity. That’s been a big theme for what’s been going on in the venture business over the past five to ten years. I think that is a good thing because it allows more people to participate in the financing of startups. You don’t need to have a $100 million fund to do that. Actually, with the launch of the syndicates feature on AngelList, you can be in business as a venture capitalist with other people’s money without even raising a fund because you just get a bunch of people to follow you on AngelList and effectively, you could marshal up a million dollars of funding without even having to raise that money. I think that will make raising the first round — the seed round for most entrepreneurs — a lot easier. And it has gotten way easier I think, which is why there are so many startups to talk about every day. BI: You mentioned that it’s always been a trend of people leaving bigger firms to start new ones. What about, for example, Josh Kushner? He raised a fund soon after he graduated from college. Is this something we should expect to see more of? FW: I think there are a few people in the venture business in New York who come from families that have the resources to start their venture capital careers. In New York, because of the media industry, the real estate industry and Wall Street, there are a lot of families with large capital bases. It wouldn’t surprise me that we’d continue to see young people getting out of college and deciding that this is what they want to do and having their families support them in that. That could be an emerging trend. In the Bay Area, too. I’m sure something like this has happened in the Bay Area as well. BI: Mike Rothenberg (28), Joshua Kushner (28), Nikhil Khalghatgi (30) and Mike Brown (30) are all examples of young people who have raised their own large funds. But you’ve said you feel venture capital should be an “old man or woman’s business.” Why? FW: What I meant by that — BI: Not that you’re old. FW: Well, I am 52. I’m pretty old. What I meant by that is there are a lot of people in the venture capital business who used to be entrepreneurs. In fact, if you look at a firm like Kleiner Perkins, Gene Kleiner and Tom Perkins were entrepreneurs and then when they got into the second half of their careers, they moved to become VCs. The same thing is true with Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen. They were entrepreneurs and when they got into their 40s they thought, “Starting a company is hard work and we’ve done it a bunch. We know a lot about it. Maybe, if we transition to being VCs, we can have hundreds of entrepreneurs become successful with all the things we learned being entrepreneurs.” I think there’s this classic thing where, when you’re in your 20s and 30s, you’re an entrepreneur. And when you’re in your 40s and 50s, you’re a VC. That’s kind of what I meant by it. I don’t mean that Josh Kushner or Dave Tisch or Mike Brown — some of the younger VCs in New York — can’t be good VCs. Although, I do think it’s a business that takes a little bit of time to learn. You can learn it much faster if you move from being an entrepreneur into being a venture capitalist 15, 20, 25 years into your career, because you have a network and you have all that experience and a lot of it is transferable. But if you come into the venture business right out of college or grad school as I did, it takes a long time to learn the business because you’ve got to learn everything. If you come into the venture business right out of college or grad school as I did, it takes a long time to learn the business because you’ve got to learn everything. BI: You’ve said it took you 10 years to become a “halfway decent” venture capitalist. Now you’re one of the best-known and admired investors. How did you create your legacy? FW: I’ve been at it for a long time. I was doing deals here in New York City in 1990, so that’s almost 25 years ago, and there weren’t many people who were doing deals in New York City in 1990. When Jerry Colonna and I started Flatiron Partners in 1996, we were really alone with RRE, one of the two New York-centered venture firms. We were high-profile for some reason. I don’t entirely know why. We certainly didn’t really deserve it. We made a lot of money, but everybody made a lot of money in that period. If you couldn’t make money in the venture business from ‘96 to 2000, you were bad. Just really bad. We were OK, we weren’t great. But we were good enough and we made a bunch of money. We did some high-profile deals like TheStreet.com and The Industry Standard — which was the big magazine at the time — Inside.com, which was another media-focused thing, so there were a lot of people writing about us. Maybe that’s what it was. By the time we started USV in 2003 I’d been investing here in New York for over a decade. I think along with Kevin Ryan [Editor's note, Ryan cofounded Business Insider, and is Chairman] and a few other people, I sort of became one of the veterans of the community.  BI: When people think of USV, they think of you. But there are other partners there doing great jobs. Tell me about Albert Wenger. Could he one day run USV? FW: Albert did the MongoDB deal. I think in some ways MongoDB is one of the most interesting New York success stories of the past decade because it’s the kind of company you wouldn’t expect to find in New York. It’s a hardcore tech company; a database software company. Oracle and MySQL and all the big database companies came out of Silicon Valley. Albert’s a computer scientist and he was really taken with what Dwight Merriman [Editor's note, Merriman cofounded Business Insider] and Elliot Horowitz were building there. Albert has Foursquare and Edmodo, which is a really big education network platform based in Silicon Valley. He’s got Twilio, which has become hugely successful and Wattpad. He also found Etsy for us. If you look at the portfolio Albert’s built since 2008 when he joined us from Delicious, he’s made 15–20 investments. I think at least half of them could be billion-dollar companies. A couple of them already are. He’s probably the best relatively new VC in New York City based on his track record. There are other people you mentioned — Josh Kushner, Dave Tisch and Mike Brown — who could emerge as good or better than Albert, but they haven’t been at it quite as long. I’m really pleased to see the success he’s had because he’s super bright and he’s great to work with. BI: Why does he fly under the radar? FW: It’s hard because I have such a big profile and it’s difficult to have multiple front people in a venture firm … Brad Burnham has been an equal partner with me since the very beginning. He should get as much credit for our success as I do. He doesn’t, and that’s not right or fair. It’s because I’ve been more public and more out there with my blog and public speaking. I’d like to try to tone it down as much as possible and push them out into the forefront. But it will take a long time before [the public perception] changes. BI: What about your newest partner, Andy Weissman? How did you recruit him from the firm he co-founded, Betaworks? FW: My view of it (and Andy and John Borthwick may have slightly different perspectives) was that Betaworks had one foot in being an incubator and one foot in being a seed investor. We invested with Betaworks in Tumblr, Kickstarter and a number of other startups. From afar, I felt like John really wanted Betaworks to be more of an incubator and Andy wanted Betaworks to be more of a seed investor. They were struggling to figure out if they should create more startups like Bitly and Chartbeat, or if they should do more investments in Tumblrs and Kickstarters. It felt to me that what John really wanted to do was become more of an incubator — a holding and operating company. I didn’t think Andy was as excited about that path. I approached Andy. We had already had a lot of experiences with him before we asked him to join us as a partner. We knew how he conducted himself with entrepreneurs. So I said, “We need another partner because we’re doing another early stage fund and we need to have some more capacity. Would you be interested in possibly joining us?” He was. Then he went and said to John, “Look, I think you want to take Betaworks in more of an incubator direction and I really have my heart set on doing venture, so maybe we can find a nice parting of the ways,” and they did. He joined us for our 2012 fund, which we raised in the final quarter of 2011. He’s been here for about 2 ½ years. What’s interesting is, we’ve done three early stage funds and we’re about to embark on our next one. The first early stage fund, the 2004 fund, Brad and I essentially made 10 investments each. Then the next early stage fund, Albert joined us. Brad and I made four investments each and Albert made 10. Then our next fund, Brad and Albert and I made three investments each and Andy made eight investments. That’s kind of how we’ve done it: We’ve invited one new person to come in and that person drives a lot of the new investment activity in that fund because the existing partners have legacy portfolio companies we spend a lot of time on. There’s no way I could make eight investments, for example, in the next three or four years. But when someone comes in here without a legacy portfolio, they can do that. That model has worked really well for us. Now what’s happened is that Brad and I are coming off of almost all those investments we made in the 2004 round. I’m not on the board of Twitter anymore. Delicious, TACODA, Twitter, Tumblr and most of those companies have exited now. There are a few that haven’t, like Etsy, where I’m still on the board. But now we have all this new capacity that we didn’t have three or four years ago. So our next early stage fund we’re not going to have a new partner come on because Brad and I can collectively be the new partner. Andy came in and he’s done a bunch of really good investments for us. Unlike Albert, I can’t tell you yet that Andy’s got the greatest portfolio of any VC his age [because he hasn’t been at it for long enough and cycles take about seven years], but I think early signs are quite good for Andy. He has really fit in and helped us make a lot of investments that fit right into our model. BI: What were the three startups you invested in during the last fund? FW: One we’ve not announced. It’ll be the last investment of the 2012 fund and we haven’t closed it yet, but I’m leading that. Then Sidecar and Coinbase. BI: What is USV’s investment thesis? Social platforms? FW: What we say is “networks.” Social was the predominant kind of network we invested in during the 2004 fund. That fund had Twitter, Tumblr, Zynga and Delicious in it. The 2008 fund was more things like Kickstarter, Edmodo, Wattpad and SoundCloud, which are networks. They are social, but not like the others. Edmodo is a really good example of what I mean by networks. Edmodo is a Facebook-like network that public school teachers use. It’s free, so any teacher can just say, “We’re going to be using Edmodo in this class this year.” Then the teacher invites the students to connect to her on Edmodo, and in their timelines they get all their homework assignments, their reading assignments, their practice tests and all that. When they go home it’s all in their Edmodo. It’s a network, teacher-to-teacher, then teacher-to-student … It’s social, but not in the way Instagram is social. It’s social in the pursuit of education; like Wattpad is for writing and reading; or SoundCloud is for making and listening to music. The 2004 fund had these big horizontal social platforms. In the 2008 fund, it was more vertically-oriented networks that had a social component to them. In the 2012 fund, it’s really been more marketplaces. So Funding Circle, Kitchensurfing and Sidecar. We’re still doing “networks,” but we’ve been looking more for transactional networks where there’s money exchanging hands. It’s not that we wouldn’t do something purely social, but we haven’t so far. BI: Is that because all the social platforms and networks have been built already? FW: No. I think it’s just that we invest in what’s interesting to us. We maybe suffer a little bit from from been-there-done-that and want to move on to whatever’s next. I do think that being first to something is often better. If you think about the big social platforms, LinkedIn and Facebook were started in 2004, and Twitter was started in 2006, and they are as big, or bigger than, any other social platform out there. I think Instagram may be as big as Twitter now, but the next wave of social platforms have in general been a little smaller: Tumblr and Pinterest and Foursquare. The next wave of social platforms didn’t quite get to the same scale. I think that oftentimes the first of a category ends up being the biggest of a category. Then as the category matures and there become more segments, those segments might not be as big, so we tend to like to try to be in the first wave. In crowdfunding, Lending Club and Kickstarter I think are going to be bigger than the next wave of crowdfunding things, which are more constrained and more niche. It doesn’t mean that those aren’t going to be good, but I think getting there first is oftentimes the best. BI: You said Instagram is as big as Twitter. In terms of active users? FW: I think it is. Not in terms of revenues. But I think in terms of active users they’re probably as big as Twitter. It’s easier to post a photo than it is to write a Tweet. BI: It’s all about the selfie craze, too. FW: Although the selfie craze has really moved to Snapchat, right? It feels to me like photo sharing went from Facebook to Instagram. Then with the arrival of Snapchat, there’s now the stuff that I really want people to see and then there’s the stuff that I really only want my friends to see. A lot of the stuff that was on Instagram has now moved to Snapchat. It doesn’t mean that people are not using Instagram, but if I go back and look at my Instagram feed a year ago versus today, there’s a lot of people who were in my Instagram feed a year ago who aren’t there today. They’ve been replaced by brands. So now my Instagram feed is full of things like the New York Knicks and restaurants posting amazing photos of food. The young Facebook user base who left Facebook to go to Instagram has now seemingly moved mostly to Snapchat and my generation plus brands are what’s on Instagram now. That’s in the U.S. I think outside the U.S. might be a very different story. BI: Do you think trends like ephemerality and anonymity are here to stay?  FW: I think social is here to stay. The idea that people use the Internet to connect and share with other people is, I think, a forever phenomenon. I think a lot of what we’re seeing is a reaction to Facebook and how Facebook was so dominant as a social platform for the past 5-10 years. The things that Facebook forced you to do — to use your real name, to post something publicly that everybody could see … these are things that people ultimately had a bad reaction to. We use the word ephemeral, but to me, part of Snapchat is the fact that it’s controllable. It’s more about the control than the ephemerality. With Snapchat, I know who’s going to see this and I know it’s not going to move out beyond that place. We use the word ephemeral, but to me, part of Snapchat is the fact that it’s controllable. It’s more about the control than the ephemerality. With anonymity, for a long time it was all about real names. Mark Zuckerberg was like, “Real names is it, and anonymous is bad.” Now all of a sudden we see a lot of innovation happening with people using anonymity. I think all of this might be just a phase we’re going through. The Democrats controlled the White House and Congress for 20 years and we got The Great Society, and then Republicans came into control in the Reagan-Bush era and we got a new model, which was a reaction to that. Now it seems like the public is moving back a little bit away from that and we’ve had Democrats in the White House now for most of the past 20 years. Public mood shifts. They go this way and they go that way. I think a lot what we’re seeing now is because the Facebook model was the dominant model for a long time and I think a lot of people now are interested in these other models. But I think they’ll have their run and then it’ll be something else. BI: Switching gears a bit: 2012 was not the best year for you, if I recall a blog post I read. FW: Yeah, 2012 was a bad year for me because I had too much on my plate. A lot of it was dealing with companies that weren’t going to succeed and I knew they weren’t going to succeed, yet I had to spend a lot of time on them. It got in the way of being able to make new investments. I also wasn’t particularly inspired by the things I was seeing. I talked a little bit about been-there-done-that. The whole world of social wasn’t particularly interesting to me. It was a combination of all of that, really. 2013 was better. I made two investments and found this other one, which we’re going to close in another week or two. We were much more productive in terms of new investments. With <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and the blockchain, I found something that got me excited again. BI: How do you deal with feeling uninspired? Even if you get in a rut, you don't seem like someone who will ever retire. FW: There’s a question about what’s the right thing for USV. With Andy and Albert, there’s a next generation here that at some point needs to become front and center. I’ve got to figure out a way to allow that to happen and not be hogging the limelight. Maybe an answer is to go from being the lead founding partner to more of a lower profile so their profiles can rise. But I really like working with entrepreneurs and finding new things, new technologies, new business models, new things to get excited about. I can’t imagine that I wouldn’t be doing this work in some way. But I don’t know that it will be in exactly the same way that I do it now. I’ll figure that out as it goes. We just raised two new funds, which we’re going to start investing in at some point this spring, and Brad and I signed up to be full partners in those funds. That means we’re committed to continuing our involvement at USV in the same way that we’ve been involved for the past ten years for another three or four years, minimum, because that’s how long it takes to invest a new fund. Then there’ll be another fund and then we’ll have that same decision to make. If you come back here in three years, we can talk about whether or not I’m going to sign up for another early stage fund. Right now, I’m all in. BI: What made you personally decide to go through with this new fund? FW: Part of it was feeling a lot better about the fact that there were things I wanted to invest in. There were also four or five investments that we either sold or wrote off or wound down in one way or another in the past year-ish that I was the lead investor on. BI: Turntable comes to mind. FW: Turntable and Canvas and Boxee. BI: What about [once-buzzy contact app] Brewster? FW: No, Brewster’s still going. Brewster’s doing okay. There was TargetSpot, which we sold to Radionomy. Boxee sold to Samsung. Turntable wound down. Canvas wound down. I think there’s one other, but I can’t think of which one it is right now. Those — let’s call it five because I’m pretty sure it was five — were probably collectively taking up half of my time. Now I don’t have to work on any of those, so that frees me up for a lot. Working on companies that aren’t going to be successful is, I think, an important part of being a VC because you say to the entrepreneur, “Take my money because we’re going to bring my time and our resources to help you be successful.” Just because they’re not successful doesn’t mean you can just bail on them. Eventually, these things wind themselves down and move on, but you have to be there through that whole process. It’s like having a kid, right? You can’t decide to have a kid and then at age 10 just say, “Okay, I’m out of here.” You’ve got to get the kid into college. We pride ourselves on that here at Union Square Ventures. I’ve written about this a lot, but our ratio is about a third, a third, a third. Meaning that about a third of the things we invest in literally don’t work out at all, things like Turntable and Canvas. A third of the things we invest in work out, but don’t work out very well. They lead to some kind of a sale, but it wasn’t a very successful outcome. Only a third of the things we invest in actually turn into the Twitters and Tumblrs and Etsys and Zyngas of the world. That means that two-thirds of the things you’re spending time on are things that aren’t going in the right direction, which is kind of a bummer. BI: Investing in a startup like Turntable has to be hard. You put money in and it seems like a rocket ship — then all of a sudden it tanks. What’s that like FW: Well, I think we made a bunch of mistakes there, some of which I would blame on the board and some of which I would blame on the company. But in general I think we did not react to the data. The problem with that service was people churned out of it very quickly. People would come in, fall in love with it and then six to eight weeks later, they were done with it. We knew that pretty early on, but it was hidden by the fact that the number of people who were coming on board every day was higher than the number of people who were churning out. It looked good, but we actually knew that there was something about the service. I think the problem was that it was too demanding. You had to be in it. It was too social of an experience. What I think we could have done, if we had moved quickly, is that we could have created a passive listening experience. The reality is, if you’re into electronic music or Indie Rock music or Hip Hop or whatever, there were Turntable rooms that were creating as good of a passive listening experience as anything you could get on the Internet, with these super-engaged small groups of users who were creating the streams. If there was a way to just put a Turntable room on and listen to it in the background, I think we could have built an interesting business. But we didn’t move to do that. We just stuck with it too long and it fizzled out. BI: Spotify came out pretty soon after and stole some of the thunder. FW: Spotify had been around. I think Spotify launched in the U.S., though, in a big way. I think those are different things. I don’t feel that that was the problem. Someone told me a long time ago that 80% — and this number has been true since the dawn of recorded music — 80% of listening is when someone’s playing the music for you and 20% of listening is when you’re playing the music for yourself. Vinyl records, CDs, MP3, iTunes and Spotify are experiences where I get to control what I’m listening to and Pandora or AM radio or FM radio is when someone plays the music for me. I think there’s a huge market out there for, “I don’t really want to think about it. I just want to listen.” Pandora is huge. I think with Turntable we just got that mix wrong. But it was good while it lasted. BI: USV was in Tumblr. Tumblr had a billion-dollar exit to Yahoo, but it didn’t get the New York scene excited like Instagram did in Silicon Valley. They were both the same sale price, both sold to big companies. Why did their sales caused different reactions? FW: Some of it might be the narrative. Instagram came out and when it was super hot, Facebook bought it. Their whole thing happened in the span of 24 months. Tumblr, we invested in in 2007 and it exited in 2013, so it was a six-year experience. I think people understood that the sale of Tumblr in some ways was a reflection of the fact that Tumblr struggled to become a business. The product is still hugely successful. If you look at the numbers in terms of number of active participants on the network and pageviews, all of that keeps going up even after Yahoo bought it. It’s never, ever slowed down. But Tumblr really struggled to build a business, a sustainable business that could make it an independent company the way that Twitter successfully did, the way that LinkedIn successfully did, the way that Facebook successfully did. The sale to Yahoo in some ways was, I think, a reflection of the fact that they ran out of time on that. The sale price was awesome and David made a great outcome for himself personally and we did really, really well on our investment. But I do think that the narrative there wasn’t quite the same thing. It was maybe a little bit like what could’ve been, had Tumblr been able to figure out how to make itself a stand-alone business. Maybe it could’ve ended up going public and being worth five or 10 times what it sold for. By the way, the same thing’s true with Instagram. If Instagram had stayed independent, it would be worth a lot more than $1 billion, no question. Both of those companies probably sold too cheap, relative to what they could’ve been had they remained independent companies. But I think the Tumblr story is different because they gave it a shot, whereas Instagram never even tried. BI: What’s happening in the New York City scene? Is there something happening here that makes the startup scene less exciting than in years past? FW: What I was thinking as you were asking the question is that I’d love to look at the data. We make about eight investments a year, maybe 10. It would be interesting to look at the percentage of those investments that are in New York vs. outside of New York and to see if that’s changed. I feel like the percentage of investments that we make in New York, out of the total that we make every year, has come down, and that we’re making more investments in other places like Europe, Silicon Valley, Waterloo, Toronto (Kik is in Waterloo and Wattpad is in Toronto). ... I think a couple things are happening in New York. I think that there are a bunch of companies that have been around for a while in New York. Tumblr is an example of that. Foursquare is an example of that. Etsy’s an example of that. Kickstarter’s an example of that. Gilt could go on and on and on. These are not new stories and haven’t been new stories in a long time. They’re doing really well and soaking up a lot of the talent. But what’s an example of a company in New York that has come out of the gate in the last few years and really made a name for itself? Another company’s Warby Parker, but Warby Parker’s been around for four, five years. I’m just trying to think. It feels like the breakouts that we were having in New York in the 2008, 2009, 2010 period produced a lot of interesting companies. Kickstarter’s going to be 100 employees probably by the end of this year. Etsy’s going to be 500 employees. MongoDB, Foursquare have 200 employees. So these are all big companies now. Has there been a breakout? I don’t know. BI: Not that I can think of. FW: You would know. Let me just look quickly at some data and see [pulls up computer screen]. The companies we’ve invested in in New York ... There’s Codecademy, Shapeways and Stack Exchange. Now Stack Exchange is amazing. It’s a huge company. People don’t write about it, but Stack is an unbelievable success. But because it’s like GitHub, it’s a service for geeks, people don’t write about it. We had three companies in 2010 in New York. In 2011, there was Skillshare, Codecademy, Brewster, and then Canvas and Turntable, which are no longer. In 2012 we did Behance, which got sold. Then in 2013, we did Kitchensurfing, VHX and Splice. Those are all three interesting companies, but they haven’t broken out yet. I think all three could do amazing things, but they haven’t yet, so I don’t know. But we continue to invest in New York: Three out of eight is not a bad number. That’s 40%. BI: Going back to your 2012 rut and coming out of it: Discovering <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> seemed to lift your investing spirits. Why? FW: I first heard about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> in 2011. It was in the winter, so maybe January or February of 2011. I bumped into my friend who was the founder of our portfolio company, Covestor, in the Garment District. I said, “What are you up to?” He said, “I’m starting a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> company.” I’d never heard of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, so I said, “What’s that?” And he said, “I’ve got to tell you about this. It’s amazing.” He came in and told me about it. We thought about investing in his company, but everybody here at USV was like, “I don’t know if we can do this. This thing is sketchy. There’s all kinds of weird stuff going on here.” So we spent about a year, and it was mostly me and Albert, doing our homework on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. By the middle of 2012, we felt like we should invest in something. That’s when I bet on the Coinbase guys. They were at Y Combinator. I immediately knew I wanted to invest in Coinbase, but they were coming out of Y Combinator and they did a seed round, and frankly it wasn’t really a good fit for us in terms of how much they were raising. About six months later, in early January of last year, Brian reached out to me and I said, “Yeah, we want to invest.” I guess we were interested in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> for a long time and Coinbase was the first company we saw that was built on top of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> that we thought was a good investment. It’s turned out to be a great investment. The fundamentals of the business are great in terms of their revenues and their users. They have over a million hosted wallets now — that’s like a million bank accounts basically — which is amazing. It’s a million people. BI: I think the majority of the world still has no idea what the heck <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is, so to have a million that quickly is impressive. FW: And they’re in the U.S. If you don’t live in the U.S., you are less likely to use Coinbase because it’s a U.S.-dollar centric investment, U.S.-banking centric. The thing about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s like this global system. What service was your first email account on? BI: AOL. FW: Good. I was afraid I was going to date myself. In the early days, you would have AOL email, or Compuserve email or Prodigy email. Then SMTP came on as this underlying protocol and all of a sudden, if you are on AOL, you could email someone who was on Prodigy. It changed everything. The thing about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is like SMTP, so you have the Chinese banking system and you have the German banking system, which is really the EU now, and you have the Brazilian banking system and you have the U.S. banking system. They all kind of sit on top of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, but if you want to do <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> in the United States, you’ve got to use a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> provider that’s connected into the U.S. banking system or there’s no way for you to get your money in and out of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. What’s happened is, these companies that have gotten built up on top of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> tend to be geography-focused. So Blockchain.info is really Western Europe-focused and BTC China is focused on China and Coinbase is focused on the U.S. What’s interesting about Coinbase is they have a million customers in the United States, so it’s not even a global customer base. If they go to Europe, which I hope that they will do, they could potentially double in size just by opening up a new market for them. I just really like the technology of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. The thing that I believe in more than anything is that when you have technologies that open up markets, lots of good things happen. The thing that was always amazing about the Internet is that anybody could put a Web server on the Internet and then anybody anywhere in the world could open up their browser and connect to that Web server and nothing else had to happen. That was the only thing that had to happen. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s kind of the same way. It’s a completely open system. Nobody controls it. It’s not owned by a company. It just is. It’s <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. I think as a platform to build stuff on, the way that the Internet was in the early ‘90s, it’s just amazing. I think the architecture with these blockchains is going to get replicated for lots of different applications. It won’t be <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. It’ll be <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Namecoin">Namecoin</a></span> for identity, it’ll be Mastercoin for exchanges. There’s all these new blockchains that are coming up that support different use cases. I think this architecture is really, really important. That’s what got me excited about it. BI: Final question just to bring this conversation full circle: To clarify, no retirement plans anytime soon? You’re in venture capital for at least a few more years and even if you were to take a step back, USV would go on? FW: I can’t imagine a time when I’m not going to be part of USV, but I can imagine a time when one of my partners — Andy or Albert or both of them — are the people. People say, “Oh yeah, go talk to Fred at USV.” It’ll be, “Go talk to Andy at USV,” or, “Go talk to Albert at USV.” They’ll become front and center in people’s minds when people think about USV. I think that’d be a good thing. That’s what happened at Kleiner Perkins. Gene Kleiner and Tom Perkins passed the business to John Doerr and Vinod Khosla. That would be a good thing for us to do as well. Join the conversation about this story »

                                An anonymous reader writes "For about a decade, Gene Robinson has been putting cameras on remote-controlled model aircraft and using them in search-and-rescue missions. But now the Federal Aviation Administration has shut him down, saying his efforts violate a ban on flying RC aircraft for commercial purposes. Robinson doesn't charge the families of the people he's looking for, and he created a non-profit organization to demonstrate that. He also coordinates with local authorities and follows their guidelines to the letter. The FAA shut him down because they haven't designed regulations to deal with situations like this, even though they've been working on it since 2007. 'So it's difficult to argue that his flights are more dangerous than what goes on every weekend at RC modeling sites throughout the United States, which can include flights of huge models that weigh 10 times as much as Robinson's planes; aerial stunts of nitromethane-fueled model helicopters; and the low-altitude, 500-kilometer-per-hour passes in front of spectators of model jets powered by miniature turbine engines.'" <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

We costed health systems strengthening and six investment packages for: maternal and newborn health, child health, immunisation, family planning, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, and malaria. Nutrition is a cross-cutting theme. We then used simulation modelling to estimate the health and socioeconomic returns of these investments. Increasing health expenditure by just $5 per person per year up to 2035 in 74 high-burden countries could yield up to nine times that value in economic and social benefits.

                                Gazprom’s decision to hike the price of the gas it sells to Ukraine came as no surprise as it was flagged more than a month ago. At that time the company’s website showed the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, and Gazprom’s chairman, Alexei Miller, sitting across a desk discussing what to do about Ukraine’s outstanding debt for current gas supplies. As if anyone needed convincing, this cosy image makes clear the use of Gazprom as a tool of Russian foreign policy. But it is this same foreign policy that may yet threaten the future of Gazprom – one of the world’s largest companies. Europe needs Russian gas just as much as Gazprom needs Europe’s cash. The company has clashed with Ukraine – and by extension the rest of Europe – over supply twice before: in 2006 and 2009. But those were primarily commercial disputes with geopolitical undertones – this time the situation is reversed. Ironically, 2013 proved a bumper year for Gazprom. Total sales were worth US$162 billion, exports to Europe accounted for 39% of this and exports through Ukraine about 20%. The bottom line is that it does not serve the Kremlin or Gazprom well to disrupt gas supplies to Europe. Even before the current crisis all was not well for Gazprom in Europe. The European Commission has threatened antitrust charges over the way it prices gas and demand has fallen due to the economic downturn, subsidies for renewable power, the low cost of carbon trading and the availability of cheap coal; all of which means that gas is losing out badly to coal and renewables. The company has granted discounts and relaxed contract terms, but the vast majority of its sales remain oil-indexed and long-term (which also means that many of its European customers are tied in to contracts for years to come). The EU’s options are clearly limited by its ongoing dependence on Russian gas. Though Russia’s share of EU-27 imports of natural gas declined from 45.1% to 31.8% between 2003 and 2010, there are still calls for further reductions. In the past the EU’s key worry over Gazprom’s gas was one of “transit security”, especially through Ukraine. Gazprom responded by rerouting supply lines. A major pipeline running under the Baltic Sea to Germany was completed in 2011, and another pipeline running through the Black Sea and the Balkans was due to be completed in 2018 though this project is now on hold. Today, the EU is more worried about where its gas comes from than how it gets there. Reliance on Russia is the problem; Europe hopes alternative suppliers are the solution. Gas from Azerbaijan and beyond might help, as would <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> either imported from the US or developed within the EU. But the reality is that these developments are unlikely to deliver significant amounts of new gas before the end of this decade, if at all. The proposed “single European gas market” could be an interim solution. A truly competitive market would then force Gazprom and other Russian suppliers to adhere to market principles (this might yet be the outcome of the EC antitrust case). But for the near term at least it will be very difficult for the EU to turn its back on Russian gas supplies. Even if new suppliers are found in the long term there will still be an opportunity cost for EU members as Russian gas remains the cheapest source of supply. The EU’s ambitious climate change and energy policy could be another solution, as energy efficiency and renewables promotion will both reduce gas demand. Whichever path is pursued – and the likelihood is an Obama-like “all of the above” approach – Gazprom will lose market share in Europe and its fortunes will then depend on Russia and the rest of Asia. Putin travels to Beijing next month and hopes to sign a long-term gas agreement with China. After years of negotiations, the two sides have agreed on everything but the price. However, although China needs to burn more gas and less coal to address its air pollution crisis, recent events might make Beijing wary of tying itself into a long-term relationship with Russia. But equally, events in Europe might make the Russian side more willing to concede on price, thus making agreement more likely. If the two countries fail to strike a deal, Gazprom will be in a tough spot and may yet fall victim to rivals. Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned oil giant wants to develop its own gas business and is seeking access to Gazprom’s planned pipeline in Asia. Late last year Gazprom lost its monopoly over Russia’s gas exports and it now faces stiff competition from Rosneft and others. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Gazprom will not remain intact much longer. Michael Bradshaw receives funding from the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC)

                                From Shakespearean flash mobs in London, to zombies and a “dying” koala at one of Australia’s most popular art galleries in Brisbane, there are growing protests over big oil and gas companies' sponsorship of the arts. Corporate polluters engage in art sponsorship as part of their quest for what they call a “social license” to operate. That means winning local, national, and international communities support. A Santos sign during the Brisbane Festival, 2012. Gord McKenna/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND For instance, global oil and gas company BP has powerful, enduring relationships with Britain’s principal cultural institutions as measured by size, visits, and media coverage, including the National Gallery, the National Maritime Museum, Tate Britain, the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, and the National Gallery. The company says it “has proudly supported arts and culture in the UK for over 35 years”, with particular reverence for exhibits that attract large numbers of visitors. At a cost of £10 million in 2011, that’s small fry for a company with revenue that year of US$75,475 million. In 2006, BP gave a million dollars to Long Beach’s Aquarium of the Pacific. When one of its oilrigs exploded in the Gulf of Mexico four years later, both sides reconsidered the partnership. In the UK, BP quickly withdrew much of its marketing. Today, the company enjoys prominant naming rights over the “BP Sea Otter Habitat”. The friendly face of pollution Blockbuster shows sponsored by environmental miscreants give alibis to big cultural institutions, as well as big environmental polluters, by countering populist claims that only élite segments of society visit such places. And they associate populism with big oil. One of the biggest exhibitions currently on in Australia is Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang’s dramatic Falling Back to Earth, held at the popular Queensland Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) in Brisbane. About 20 protesters dressed as zombie farmers in 2012. AAP Image/Marty Silk The presenting sponsor is the Santos GLNG Project, a US$18.5 billion consortium that is converting coal seam natural gas (CSG) to liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export to global markets. It involves tapping into vast gas fields in the Bowen and Surat Basins in Queensland, constructing a 420 kilometre underground gas transmission pipeline to the coastal city of Gladstone, and a two-train LNG processing facility on Curtis Island in Gladstone. In a stunt last month, protesters from Generation Alpha went to GOMA after it was revealed Santos had contaminated a water aquifer in north-west New South Wales with arsenic, uranium, lead and nickel. One protester dressed as a koala drank the water and pretended to die. It followed a similar protest two years ago, when activists dressed as zombie farmers gatecrashed an opening night event. Greenwash Rising Tide UK’s Art Not Oil project takes as its motto “For creativity, climate justice and an end to oil industry sponsorship of the arts”. The project began in 2004 as a challenge and stimulus to current and potential artists to forge their practice and exhibitions in sustainable ways, and to work against the unsustainability of BP, Shell, and others—as businesses in general, but more particularly as sponsors of the arts. Rising Tide calls such sponsorship for what it is: greenwash. By sponsoring our cultural institutions, Shell tries to protect its reputation, distract our attention from its environmental and human rights crimes around the world and buy our acceptance. They are not alone. The Reclaim Shakespeare Company formed a flash mob (“Out Damn Logo”) to criticize the British Museum for accepting BP money to help fund “Shakespeare: Staging the World”. Yoko Ono goes a step further, beyond opposing sponsorship and towards protest, via her New York-based alliance Artists Against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fracking">Fracking</a></span>. Beyond petroleum For some, concerns about the ethics of corporate sponsorship of the arts go beyond the involvement of major energy companies. For instance, in February this year a group of international artists dropped fake dollar bills from the dramatic spiral at the Guggenheim in Manhattan to draw attention to the labor exploitation of migrant workers in Abu Dhabi, where the museum is building an outpost funded by oil profits. In Australia around the same time, longstanding sponsors of the Sydney Biennale withdrew because of a threatened boycott by artists in protest at the firm Transfield’s involvement with Australia’s overseas detention of refugees. Several critics, including the Australian government, complained about artists taking such political action, and threaten retribution. In an open letter to the Biennale’s Board, the artists explained that they rejected “adding value to the Transfield brand” because “participation is an active endorsement, providing cultural capital”. This raises questions about the responsibility of artists to provide social commentary and the responsibility of the arts bourgeoisie to secure ethical funding. Yelling fire, when it’s needed The artistic right to free speech is not, of course, absolute (it’s illegal in the US to shout “Fire!” in a theatre audience when there isn’t one). Speech is protected when it renews society through the force of critique. But instead of attacking artists for promoting justice, we should turn our gaze to cultural institutions’ complicity with malfeasance. Protesting “against the slimy spread of oil money through our theatres”. Reclaim Shakespeare Company, CC BY-NC-ND Critics might say that artistic appeals to people’s emotions, like those I’ve described, will fail for many reasons. That’s because the silent majority doesn’t like direct action; corporations can easily outspend activists; media coverage is partial and hostile; and crucial decisions are made by élites, not in streets. All those points are true. I generally incline towards that kind of critical view of populist activism. But not in this case. Good humour is crucial to sidestepping the common image of environmentalists as scolds. Equally, corporate excess must be opposed in public. And the media’s need for image and excitement can be twinned with serious discussion and involve people who are not conventional activists, Environmentalism does need to lighten up sometimes – and one way to do that is through sophisticated, entertaining, participatory spectacles, like flash mobs. The right blend of irony, sarcasm, and showmanship is a good way to mock high art’s dalliance with high polluters. Bravo.

An Australian trader operating through Local<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s.com and an another Australian <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchange CoinJar have received letters from NAB informing them that: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currency">digital currency</a></span> providers pose an unacceptable level of risk, both to our business and reputation. NAB joins banks in China such as the Agricultural Bank of China, that has moved to freeze the accounts of one of China’s larger <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchanges, BtcTrade. Likewise, banks in Canada have already largely blocked accounts used for companies trading cryptocurrencies. Mt Gox the tipping point? It is easy to point to the recent failure of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchange Mt Gox and the subsequent law suits that have embroiled Japanese bank Mizhuo, as a catalyst for NAB’s move. But if banks refused to service businesses after one or more of their kind went bust, they would not be left with very many clients. The risk assessed was also not one based on the companies involved, their operations or their clients, it was simply a matter of the business they were in. Self-interest? While moves by banks to manage risk is something most customers would welcome, the global financial crisis showed us banks’ views of risk are highly selective and largely determined by the other part of this equation: the rewards. In terms of cryptocurrencies, the rewards to banks at present are very low. This is especially the case for a currency that is designed to largely cut them out of the picture. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and other <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> are designed to be exchanged directly between senders and receivers. This means that currently, transaction costs and bank fees can be avoided, so banks’ enthusiasm for supporting this industry or promoting it would be tepid at best. The real risk to banks is perhaps then not that posed by customers using accounts to enable <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchanges, but the threat to their bottom line. NAB’s own senior currency analyst Emma Lawson has argued <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> has many of the characteristics of regular currency, and that its potential to become a successful payment system it contingent on people’s continued belief in it. Clearly something that banks aren’t yet willing to see happen. Dirty money If banks are asked to justify their decisions purely on risk, they are likely to point to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s association with criminal activities. The rhetoric here has recently stepped up with the European police chief claiming we’re just seeing the beginning of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s use by criminal organisations. Other than the clear use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> as the payment system of illegal websites such as Silk Road), the use of cryptocurrencies as a proportion of the total value of money involved in crime is probably tiny. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2009 the total amount of money involved in global criminal activity was US$2.1 trillion. The total market capitilisation of all cryptocurrencies is currently less than US$10 billion. Cryptocurrencies may appear to be ideally suited to money laundering, but the problem is they eventually have to be exchanged for real currency, which immediately causes problems if you are trying to move large amounts of money. The second issue is the extremely volatile value of such currencies. There is a large risk that money with a certain value ends up being worth a lot less by the time it has been laundered and converted into a currency that can be actually put to some use. Of the U$2.1 trillion that is involved annually in global criminal activity, most, if not all, will pass through banks at some point, and not surprisingly, will drive revenue for those banks. The idea then that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> pose a larger theoretical threat seems somewhat absurd in comparison to the very real crime involving real currency. Masterly inactivity Governments around the world have moved to deal with the lack of regulations on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> by either banning the currency outright, as in Thailand, or practising “masterly inactivity”, essentially delaying making any moves that might legitimise <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> and the industries that would then arise around them. In this regulatory vacuum, banks have been able to protect themselves against the threat of the bankless payment system that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currencies">digital currencies</a></span> represent.

                                Free, unencrypted wireless is everywhere, but you shouldn't be checking your bank account on it unless you don’t mind somebody else snooping. The solution? A virtual private network, or VPN. A VPN extends your own private network into public places, so even if you’re using Starbucks' Wi-Fi connection, your Internet browsing stays encrypted and secure. There are plenty of ways to set up a VPN, both with free and paid services, but each solution has its own pros and cons, determined by the way the VPN provider operates and charges and the kinds of VPN options it provides.  The easiest and cheapest solution to keep your data safe is to just abstain from public Wi-Fi completely. But that sounds a little extreme to me when it’s relatively simple and inexpensive to build your own VPN server at home, and run it off of a tiny, inexpensive ($35) Raspberry Pi.  See also: Raspberry Pi: Everything You Need To Know My Raspberry Pi is about the size of a smartphone, but it runs a fully functional VPN server. That means no matter where I am, I can connect my computer to my home network and access shared files and media over a secure connection. It came in handy on a recent trip to Boston, where I was still able to watch videos stored on my network back home in DC.   This is the part where I’d link you to a handy tutorial on how to set this up. The problem is one doesn't exist—or at least one that could satisfy this average computer user. And while there are plenty of tutorials about how to set up a VPN server on Raspberry Pi, there are very few that explain why.  I read several different tutorials and cobbled together the results into this semi-coherent tutorial for setting up a VPN on Raspberry Pi, which even I can understand, complete with the why behind the how. So follow me down the cryptography rabbit hole and learn that no matter how paranoid you are, whoever came up with the methods to generate VPNs was even more so.   Materials Hardware Raspberry Pi Model B: Plus everything that comes with it—by that, I mean a regular power source and a case to put it in. A case can help prevent accidental short-circuits that could permanently damage the machine—the case can even be as simple as a cardboard box you fold yourself. SD card: I’m suggesting 8GB or more, just to make sure you have the space. As always for all Raspberry Pi projects, this should already have NOOBS installed.  Cat5e cable: This will connect the Pi’s ethernet port to the ethernet port on the router.  Software Open VPN: This is the open source VPN service we’ll be installing today.  Pre-Project Requirements 1) You need to set up NOOBS and install Raspbian. I wrote a step-by-step for this in my quantified fish tank tutorial, so you can refer to it there.  See also: 5 Pointers To Supercharge Your Raspberry Pi Projects 2) You need a static IP address for the Raspberry Pi on your home network. This depends on the model of your router, so use the instructions provided by the router’s manufacturer. If you don’t already have this set up, read ReadWrite’s tutorial.   3) You'll need SSH enabled. We’ll be connecting to the Raspberry Pi with SSH, a connection tool that lets us access the Pi from another computer. This way, we don’t need to set up the Pi to a monitor and wireless keyboard for this project. Once again, check ReadWrite’s tutorial.  4) You'll need to forward port 1194 (UDP traffic) to your Raspberry Pi’s internal IP address, but the way you do this will vary depending on your router, so check with your router manufacturer’s information. If you want to use another port or TCP, that’s fine, but just be sure to change 1194 in the tutorial to the correct number for you, and anywhere it says "UDP" to "TCP." You guessed it, there's a ReadWrite tutorial for this, too. You can tell we’re building off of some more basic Raspberry Pi concepts, which is why building a VPN with Raspberry Pi isn't a good first project for most beginners.  A Quick Word Of Caution I've pasted the actual code I used to complete this project, but when going back through the tutorial myself, I noticed that copying and pasting the code from the article onto the command line often results in errors due to spacing and formatting. If you are having a problem with any step of this tutorial, my first troubleshooting suggestion is to rewrite the command manually!  First Steps 1) Boot up and change your password. If you’re still using the default username (pi) and password (raspberry), it makes the rest of this security project totally pointless!  Open up a terminal/PuTTY window and type: sudo passwd Change the username and password to something strong and memorable (Microsoft offers some tips), otherwise why bother building a private network?  2) Now let’s be safe and update the Raspberry Pi. There are two commands you want to input:  sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade This shouldn’t take long, and it’ll save us a troubleshooting step later on.  3) Next we need the open source software. Type:  sudo apt-get install openvpn The Raspberry Pi is going to ask if you’re sure, since it uses up a bit of space. But since we prepared by getting an 8GB or bigger SD card, we’re totally fine.  Generating Keys 4) You don’t want anyone who finds your VPN server address to be able to connect. So next, we’re going to make a key for the server address. It’s just like keeping the door to your house locked.  OpenVPN comes with Easy_RSA, a light and easy package for using the RSA encryption method. Developed in 1977, RSA was one of the first usable cryptosystems that is still used today. The encryption key is public, while the decryption key is secret. If you’ve read anything about how <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> works, this might sound a bit familiar.  With Easy_RSA, you run an algorithm that comes with the software to generate a new unique key.  So first, let’s give ourselves superuser privileges. You’ll know it’s working when the command line prompt switches from “pi@raspberrypi” to “root@raspberrypi.” sudo -s This command creates another instance of the window we’re working in, but with root privileges. The reason we need to do this is because if we don’t, the Raspberry Pi will try and tell us we don’t have permission to mess around with making keys.  So next, we type: cp –r /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa  Here, “cp” stands for copy and “-r” stands for recursive (having to do with smaller instances, too). That means we’re telling the computer, “Copy this directory and everything underneath it.”  The space between /2.0 and /etc means we’re copying the first address (an example file) into the second folder, which is where you’ll tell OpenVPN to find your keys.  cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa  5) Next, we need to cd, or change directory, to the place we just moved the Easy_RSA file. Once there, we need to open the file /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars for editing. We could do that by writing nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars, but since we’re in the folder, there’s a shortcut: nano vars Nano is a built-in editing tool on Raspbian, and while there are others out there for more tech-savvy people, we’re just going to use nano for all our text editing in this tutorial.  Now, find and change EASY_RSA variable to:  export EASY_RSA=”/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa”  For me, it was on line 13.   Why make this change? Basically, you’re answering the computer’s question, “Where do you want the file to go to?” We want it to export to the same folder where we will keep our keys—in this case, the top level of the easy-rsa file tree.  There’s one extra thing you can do in vars if you’re paranoid about the Illuminati reading your email—change the encryption method from 1024-bit to 2048-bit. The document literally says, “increase this to 2048 if you are paranoid.”   But since that method makes keys take way longer to generate, we’re not doing it here. We’ll keep it looking like the text below: export KEY_SIZE=1024 Type Control+X to save your changes and exit the nano editor.  Getting Cryptographic 6) It’s time to build the CA Certificate and Root CA certificate.  In cryptography, a certificate authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates. The digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key. You probably use this all the time and don’t even know it. For example, when I log into my bank account, I see an HTTPS in front of the address. If I click on the lock, I see that a company called GeoTrust verified my bank website’s legitimacy, so I know it's not a phishing scam. (Of course, the recent Heartbleed bug revealed that HTTPS isn't the security measure we all used to think it was.) See also: What You Need To Know About Heartbleed, A Really Major Bug That Short-Circuits Web Security In the case of Raspberry Pi, I’m acting as my own certificate authority and signing off on the OpenVPN keys myself, instead of trusting it to a third party company.  cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa   Now that we’ve changed directories, type each of these lines one after another: source ./vars → This “sources” or loads the vars document you edited earlier. ./clean-all → This will remove any previous keys, if there are any. If you have keys you don’t want to remove in this folder (like you’re doing this tutorial a second time), skip this command.  ./build-ca → This final line builds your certificate authority. After the third command, the Raspberry Pi is going to shoot back with a bunch of optional fields for you to fill out if you want to—Country Name, State or Province Name, Locality Name, Organization Name, Organizational Unit, Common Name, Name, and Email Address. If you don't care to fill out these fields, just hit “enter” each instance to have the Pi fill in the default value. The screenshot below shows what that looks like: Now you can name the server. I creatively named mine “Server.” Call it whatever you want, but don’t forget it: ./build-key-server [Server_Name]  Once again, the Pi is going to spit out some optional fields. Press enter or whatever you want, but pay attention to these three fields:   Common Name MUST be the server name you picked. It should default to this. A challenge password? MUST be left blank. Sign the certificate? [y/n] Obviously, you must type “y.” You’ll get a message that says the certificate will be certified for 3,650 more days. So basically if you use your VPN long enough, you’ll have to do this process again in 10 years. 1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n] Obviously, type “y.” 6) That’s the server side setup. Now it’s time to build keys for each user, or "client." I have five keys at home—one for each computer, tablet, and cell phone in the house. It’s possible to be lazy and create just one client key for all of them, but in that case, only one device would be able to access the VPN at a time.   ./build-key-pass UserName  I found it simplest to make the usernames Client1, Client2, Client3…  And after that, more prompts!  Enter PEM pass phrase Make it a password you will remember! It asks you to input this twice, so there’s no danger of ruining it.  A challenge password? MUST be left blank. Sign the certificate? [y/n] Signing certifies it for 10 more years. cd keys openssl rsa -in Client1.key -des3 -out Client1.3des.key  The important takeaway from this string of text is that we’re using des3 encryption, in which a complex encryptionalgorithm that's applied three times to each data block to keep hackers from breaking through it with brute force. OpenSSL stands for an open source implementation of Secure Socket Layer, a standard method of setting up a secure connection. You need to perform this step for every client you set up.  Some argue this step is unnecessary, and that you could simply skip this line. But if you’re running OpenVPN Connect clients on Android or iOS, this needs to be done. Otherwise, current versions could have difficulty parsing the keys you just generated.  Enter pass phrase for Client1.key Honestly, I just used the same passphrase as before. And then two more times, as shown. Now that we’ve created a server certificate and (at least one) client certificate, type the following:  cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/  OR cd ..  Either way, the computer will take you up one directory, back to /easy-rsa/.  7) Now let’s generate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This is the central code that makes your VPN server tick, an exchange that lets two entities with no prior knowledge of one another share secret keys over a public server. Like RSA, it’s one of the earliest cryptosystems out there.   ./build-dh This could take a while, longer if you’re on 2048-bit encryption. There’s no way really to predict how long it will take because it is using random numbers and looking for some specific relationships. In fact, while I was making this tutorial, it only took 5 minutes with 1024-bit encryption. 8) Finally, we’re going to implement OpenVPN’s build-in Denial of Service (DoS) attack protection. You might already know that a DoS attack is successful when a hacker finds out your server’s address, and generates such a large number of access requests that your server crashes.  OpenVPN has a way to prevent this kind of attack from occurring before it even starts by generating a static pre-shared hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) key. With this in place, the server won't even entertain the idea of authenticating an access request unless it detects this static key first. Thus, a hacker can’t just spam the server with random repeated requests.  Generate the static HMAC key with the following line: openvpn –-genkey –-secret keys/ta.key Putting It All Together 9) We’ve generated keys and a Certificate Authority to sign them. What we’re still missing are the settings to tell OpenVPN how we want this server configured. The OpenVPN program is already running. The problem is, it doesn’t know which keys to use, where you’re going to be connecting from, what kind of connection you’re building, or which IP address and port to use.  Since we’re using Linux on a Raspberry Pi, there’s no graphical user interface (GUI) for telling OpenVPN what it needs to know. That’s why we have to actually create a .conf (configuration) file in the nano editor off of the command line.  nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf  The reason we’re starting this address with /etc/openvpn is so it will end up in the openvpn folder. But for now, this file is completely blank. Fill it in with this. I commented in all caps where you absolutely need to change numbers and titles to your own IP address/names. Hit Control+X to save your changes.  10) Let’s quickly edit another configuration file. By default, Raspbian does not forward Internet traffic. We need to edit another file to allow the Pi to forward Internet traffic through our new network.  nano /etc/sysctl.conf Near the top it says, “Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4.” I've highlighted that part of the file in the screenshot below.  To uncomment the line, remove the # immediately in front of it. This is setting up the configuration so it knows to forward to IPv4. Now that you’ve uncommented this line, the Pi has permission to act as a relay on the Internet instead of just a receiver, by both sending and receiving packets.  Hit Control+X to save your changes. Apply these changes by typing the following command: sysctl -p  The sysctl command “configures kernel parameters at runtime.” The -p tells it to reload the file with the changes you just made.  11) We just made a functioning server that can access the Internet. But we can’t use it yet because Raspbian has a built-in firewall that will block incoming connections.  Raspbian has a firewall to protect your Raspberry Pi from unknown and unexpected Internet sources. We still want the firewall to protect us from most incoming and outgoing network traffic, but we need to poke an OpenVPN-shaped hole in the firewall.  Additionally, Raspbian’s firewall configuration resets by default when you reboot the Pi. We want to make sure it remembers the OpenVPN connection is always permitted, so what we’re going to do is create a simple script which runs on boot: nano /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh This is currently a blank shell executable file. Fill it with this: #!/bin/sh  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.XX.X Don’t forget to change the default IP address to your Pi’s IP address! Let’s break this down: 10.8.0.0 is the default address for Raspberry Pi for clients that are connected to the VPN. "eth0" stands for ethernet port. Switch this to "wlan0" if you’re on a wireless connection, which is not recommended. Hit Control+X to save your changes.   As a safety measure, files you create are not executable by default, so we’ll need to change the permissions and ownership of /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh. First we’ll change the mode to 700 (owner can read, write, and execute). Then, we’ll change the owner to root, in which “root” is Linux’s standard name for the superuser.  chmod 700 /etc/firewall-Openvpn-rules.sh  chown root /etc/firewall-Openvpn-rules.sh 12) We’ve created the script that punches an OpenVPN-shaped hole in the firewall. Now we just need to inject it into the interfaces setup code so it runs on boot.  nano /etc/network/interfaces Find the line that goes: “iface eth0 inet dhcp.” We want to add a line below it at an indent. So this is what the two lines, existing and new, will look like when you’re done: iface eth0 inet dhcp pre-up /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh Hit Control+X to save your changes (as you should be doing whenever you use nano).  Finally, finally, finally: Reboot your Pi.  sudo reboot See also: Building A Raspberry Pi VPN Part Two: Creating An Encrypted Client Side Congratulations!

                                NOT so long ago, China looked to be the promised land for crypto-currencies. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and its rivals were traded freely and online exchanges proliferated. On one estimate, China accounted for more than half of the world’s trade in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> last year. Near the end of last year, when its price was above $1,000, more than 100,000 coins were being traded daily on BTC China, a local exchange.Alas, those heady days are gone. Prices have plunged below $500 of late and hardly 2,000 coins are now traded daily on BTC China. According to Bobby Lee, the exchange’s founder, “Most investors have left the market.” What happened? The short answer is regulation.In early December China’s central bank declared that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was not a currency. This slowed its rise, but enthusiasts remained unbowed as the declaration fell far short of the outright ban some had feared. Then regulators forbade the firms that act as middlemen between businesses and credit-card networks from working with the exchanges. That was a more serious blow, but exchange operators found ways round the ban (for example, by using related companies to deal with the payment processors).Rumours now suggest that the...

                                The pace of technology innovation has been on a tear over the last two decades, as The Economist recently highlighted. Built on open protocols like TCP/IP and accessed through open-source browsers like Mozilla Firefox, the Web has given rise to Google, Facebook, Wikipedia and more. Freedom has been kind to innovation. That freedom, however, is now under siege. Bluntly stated, the curated mobile experience is killing the Web, app by app, leaving us with a sheltered but increasingly sterile environment for experimentation.  We Prefer Apps To Innovation We don't really have anyone to blame but ourselves. In large part, since the native app experience has been superior to mobile web browsing, users gravitate toward apps in a big way, as recent Flurry data makes clear: This jibes with Nielsen data released earlier this year that shows users spend 89% of their time on media in apps, versus just 11% through the Web. While I personally spend as much time in my Chrome browser as I do in apps like Facebook or Twitter, I might be the exception to the mobile rule.  This shift to apps, innocuous as it may appear, will have far-reaching consequences. After all, while anyone could build anything on the Web, the rules for apps are much more tightly controlled, as Andreessen Horowitz investor and Web luminary Chris Dixon warns: Apps are heavily controlled by the dominant app stores owners, Apple and Google. Google and Apple control what apps are allowed to exist, how apps are built, what apps get promoted, and charge a 30% tax on revenues. Most worrisome: they reject entire classes of apps without stated reasons or allowing for recourse (e.g. Apple has rejected all apps related to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>). Users may like the safety of a well-tended app store, but it comes with serious risks to innovation. Union Squares Ventures general partner Fred Wilson confirms this: Upon reviewing the investments his firm has made over the last 10 years (including Twitter, Tumblr, Zynga, Etsy, Boxee and more), he worries the most recent investments, coming in the shadow of the app boom, suggest that "it has gotten harder, not easier, to innovate on the Internet with the smartphone emerging as the platform of choice vs the desktop browser." (Don't) Think Different We can't blame the almighty app for this trend entirely; after all, the Web has been under attack from centralization for some time now. Google, which keeps a tight rein on mobile innovation through its Android platform, has also spent years corralling the Wild West of the open Web into a systematized "stack" that includes Gmail, YouTube, Search and more. But Google isn't alone. Bruce Sterling, a noted futurist, describes the "stackification" of the web in this way: Stacks. In 2012 it made less and less sense to talk about "the Internet," "the PC business," "telephones," "Silicon Valley," or "the media," and much more sense to just study Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. These big five American vertically organized silos are re-making the world in their image.   We look back on the early Internet and laugh at how CompuServe was ever a thing—that so many people happily used the curated AOL garden. Today, we're madly dashing back into these gated communities. But nowhere more so than on our smartphones. HTML5 And Blockchain To The Rescue? There are two reasons to remain optimistic about mobile. The first is HTML5, the development platform that, in theory, makes the mobile web look/feel/act more like native apps. While its promise has always underperformed against reality, HTML5 is good and getting better. It also continues to be the third-most interesting platform to developers: As Google continues to learn how apps are a serious threat to its search business—difficult to impossible to access content within them—it will hopefully double down on HTML5.  But the brighter hope may be Blockchain. Blockchain, the open source engine on which <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is built, is, as TechCrunch's Jon Evans explains, "a new kind of distributed consensus system that allows transactions, or other data, to be securely stored and verified without any centralized authority at all, because... they are validated by the entire network." It sounds complex, but it means the server farms that centralize so much power in Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Amazon could one day be replaced by massive distributed peer-to-peer networks. These would be open networks, just like the Internet used to be, and this level of openness would, in turn, breed innovation: I'm glad that most disruptive and exciting new platform (no, not Oculus) - the blockchain - is open source and not for sale. — Adam Ludwin (@adamludwin) March 26, 2014 Building The Future On Blockchain How Blockchain translates to mobile remains to be seen. But arguably we'll see a decentralization of control as inventors route around the gated communities of Apple and Google with Blockchain-based distribution strategies. For the moment, Apple seems determined to keep <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> out of its App Store, but that's a momentary setback, and not directly relevant. Blockchain isn't about trading <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=virtual currency">virtual currency</a></span>. No, it's much bigger than that. It's about an open, unfettered platform for innovation.

                                With the deadline of financial spring cleaning looming large, it's only natural to panic at the hopeless money morass you're wading through. Or maybe you're on your financial game but looking for a more granular way to keep tabs on your bank accounts, credit, investments and loans. Maybe what you really need is more data—that, and the best tools to manage it and your finances. Arming yourself so you can watch and execute every aspect of your financial life is empowering—and if you believe tha more data is better than less (and for the most part you should), it's extremely satisfying, too. Here are our favorite apps for managing all things money. Make Budgeting (Almost) Fun: Mint Mint is the reigning king of online money management—and with good reason. Mint makes keeping an eye on transactions across all of your accounts useful at-a-glance, and scanning individual account information is as easy as clicking a drop-down menu.  You can go as deep as you want, tagging individual transactions like work expenses, searching across all accounts at once, pooling your account histories all in one place (extremely useful for tracking when Comcast hikes up your bill, for example) and showing you where your cash goes. Mint offers a bit of basic financial planning too, with tips on saving and customizable notifications for high spending. If you’ve heard a ton about it but haven’t checked it our for yourself, Mint manages to live up to its excellent reputation. Download Mint. Best Bird’s Eye View: Manilla While it seems like a direct Mint competitor at first gloss, the two apps complement each other well. Like Mint, Manilla offers an overview of all of your accounts, but it adds some unique features into the mix. You can link up all kinds of accounts to Manilla, including billing accounts for utilities and phone service, travel rewards memberships, and media subscriptions like Netflix and The New York Times. The idea is that by getting all of your bills and memberships in one place, you won’t get slammed with late fees. If you opt to authorize it, you can view your bills on Manilla and auto-login to connected accounts to pay them easily. Download Manilla. Your Credit Score Gets Less Scary: Credit Karma Credit Karma makes it easy to view and monitor your credit—and it does it for free. Checking your credit score is a notoriously difficult process that many people only undertake on an annual basis, if at all, because it’s just that annoying. With Credit Karma, it's as simple as logging into the app, which updates your score weekly. Credit Karma isn’t perfect—its scores, provided by Transunion, don’t always match up with the official FICO score used by most lenders. But it usually tracks FICO pretty closely, and with a lot less hassle. Our favorite feature is that the service explains the factors that go into your current credit score and how to improve them. Credit Karma transforms checking your credit score from a dreaded once-a-year ritual to a daily habit, and that’s pretty empowering. Download Credit Karma for iOS/Android. 9 More Awesome Personal Finance Apps  Square Cash: Send money through email easily with no fees. Yahoo Finance: Keep tabs on the market with Yahoo's attractively redesigned iOS app. Betterment: Tend your investment portfolio. Evernote: Save and search receipts, bills and just about anything. Splitwise: Split and pay shared bills easily. Personal Cap: If "wealth management" sounds more your speed than divvying up a Netflix subscription. Check: Another option for getting your bills paid like a boss. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> Checker (Android)/Coin Ticker (iOS): If you're crazy (like a fox?) enough to hold any crypto-currencies, here's a convenient way to keep tabs on what they're worth in the world of old-fashioned money.  A word on security: If you’re going to get into the business of mobile banking, take every security precaution at your disposal. Choosing unique, strong passwords is a must and opting for two-factor authentication whenever possible is a good idea too. Enable services like that lock down your device should it get lost or stolen. Protect yourself as you revel in the ease of mobile banking—and pay your bills on time, too.  Header image by Taylor Hatmaker

                                In countries that have based their wealth on production, every discovery and innovation that potentially lower production costs attract very strong attention. Since 2007, the discovery and exploitation of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil have put the USA energy industry back on the track to competitive procurement faced with competing nations who have been low costs champions for decades.

It seems it's not an attempt to carry out snooping or attack rivals, but rather a plan to extend Internet access to places it's impossible to reach at the moment. The company in question is Titan Aerospace, which manufactures what it calls "atmospheric satellites." Unlike traditional satellites, they operate around 20 kilometers (12 miles) above Earth, which is just short of the point of being in orbit. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> such as the Solara 50 look and operate similar to an airplane, but have solar panels on its wings, ...

The collapse means customers have almost certainly lost nearly half a billion US dollars in "real money." Mt Gox is a Tokyo-based business founded in 2009 as a trading card exchange (Source: wikipedia.org ). It has recently filed for bankruptcy protection because it has debt worth $63.6 million, but assets worth only just half over that.
