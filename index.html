                                REUTERS/Mark Peters/ECCC/Handout via Reuters In this handout photo courtesy of the ECCC, former Khmer Rouge leader ''Brother Number Two'' Nuon Chea (C) sits at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) as his verdict is delivered on the outskirts of Phnom Penh August 7, 2014. Good morning! Here's what people will be chatting about on Thursday.  1. Two former leaders of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge regime were sentenced to life in jail for crimes against humanity during the "killing fields" revolution in the 1970s. Former head of state Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, both now in their 80s, are the first senior officials to be held accountable for the regime responsible for the death of around 1/4 of Cambodia's population.  2. Liberia declared a state of emergency to fight the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak. In a speech late Wednesday, Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf said that the spread of the disease was exacerbated by “ignorance and poverty, as well as entrenched religious and cultural practices," the AP reported. The death toll from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> has climbed to more than 900. Meanwhile, health experts are meeting in Geneva to discuss how to combat the virus.    3. Israel says it's willing to extend a 72-hour truce in Gaza, while Hamas reportedly denies that any such agreement has been made, according to conflicting statements from officials of the two fighting groups quoted by Reuters. A three-day ceasefire took effect on Tuesday and expires on Friday.  4. In response to sanctions, Russian president Vladimir Putin has officially banned food imports from the U.S., E.U., Canada, Australia, and Norway. Earlier, Russian officials said they would discuss "an option to increase food imports from Ecuador, Brazil, Chile and Argentina with the countries' ambassadors on Thursday," according to Reuters.  5. Bank of America has reached a tentative deal with the Justice Department to pay more more than $16 billion to settle allegations relating to mortgage fraud, which helped trigger the financial crisis. According to the Financial Times, if the agreement is finalized, it "will be the Department of Justice’s largest settlement with a single entity." 6. Italy, the third largest economy in the Eurozone, is back in recession after GDP fell 0.2% in the second quarter.  7. Google is teaming up with Barnes & Noble to offer same-day book deliveries in a move to take on online retailer giant Amazon, The New York Times reports. "Starting on Thursday, book buyers in Manhattan, West Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area will be able to get same-day deliveries from local Barnes & Noble stores through Google Shopping Express, Google’s fledgling online shopping and delivery service," the paper said.  8. Australia is holding a national day of mourning to remember the victims of the Malaysia Airlines plane that was shot down over eastern Ukraine in July. A total of 298 were killed in the tragedy; 38 were Australian, the Guardian said.  9. After a one-month break, the defense team and prosecutors are preparing to give their final closing arguments in the the Oscar Pistorius trial. The double-amputee runner is accused of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.  10. People who don't get enough Vitamin D are more likely to get dementia later in life, according to "one of the biggest studies of its kind into the nutritional supplement," The Independent said. Scientists found that senile dementia and Alzheimer’s disease were higher in elderly men and women with low levels of Vitamin D.  And finally... The European Space Agency's Rosetta Spacecraft is sending back the first images and data after becoming the first probe ever to rendevous with a comet.  Join the conversation about this story »

                                Flags flew at half mast Thursday as Australia held a national day of mourning for those killed in the MH17 crash in Ukraine, a day after experts suspended the search for body parts. Australia lost 38 citizens and residents, including children, when the Malaysia Airlines plane from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 on board. Church bells chimed around the country as a memorial service was held at St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne, chosen as 16 of the Australians who died were from Victoria state. Melbourne was also the host city for the 20th International <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> Conference with six delegates heading to the summit among those killed.

                                Flickr/m01229 You know that bag of chips sitting on your kitchen counter? It's "listening" to all the sounds in your room, and if the right visual filming equipment looks at it, other people can can hear inside your room, too. Yes, they can hear the sounds simply by looking at the bag, even through a sound-proof glass door, no sound recording needed whatsoever. "That's the results of the astounding visual microphone," project done by researchers at MIT, reports by Sarah Lewin for IEE Spectrum's blog. It works like this: All sound creates vibrations. Those vibrations move your eardrum and that's why you can hear. Sound vibration can also microscopically move other objects in the room. The researchers used a high-speed camera to film such objects and wrote an algorithm to translate the tiny movements captured on film back into the sounds that created them. Some objections captured visual sounds better than other. For instance a bag of chips, great; a potted plant, mediocre; a soda can, bad. The researchers were able to re-create the sounds, even when filming an object through a sound-proof glass door. Here's one example. A man recited "Mary Had A Little Lamb" in a room with a bag of chips. It sounded like this (video below takes about 10 seconds): They filmed a bag of chips through a sound proof glass door and re-created the sounds. This is what they heard: Amazing. The obvious implications are for video surveillance, solving crimes, and maybe spying. But who knows what kinds of creating ways talking chip bags can be used? Time will tell. The researchers plan to release the code that makes this work on the project’s website. That website also has more samples of the types of things they were able to hear by filming objects in a room. Here's the full YouTube video explanation of the project, which was uploaded on Tuesday and is already starting to go viral. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: Take A Look At This Fantastic New <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Condom Funded By Bill Gates">Condom Funded By Bill Gates</a></span> Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                U.S. health regulators on Wednesday authorized the use of an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> diagnostic test developed by the Pentagon to help contain the world's worst outbreak of the deadly virus. The move was one of a number of steps taken by the U.S. government this week to address the highly contagious disease that has killed more than 930 people in Africa and sickened hundreds more, including two Americans being treated in Atlanta. The diagnostic test was authorized for use abroad on military personnel, aid workers and emergency responders in laboratories designated by the Department of Defense to respond to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said.

                                The death toll of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic neared 1,000 on Wednesday as fears rose that the disease is taking hold in Africa's most populous nation of Nigeria, after a second death among seven confirmed cases in Lagos. The spread of the disease comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) met in an emergency session in Geneva to decide whether to declare an international crisis. The latest official toll across west Africa hit 932 deaths since the start of the year, it said on Wednesday, with 1,711 confirmed cases, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The death of a nurse in Lagos, a megacity of more than 20 million, came as 45 deaths were confirmed across west Africa between Saturday and Monday, with aid agencies, including Doctors Without Borders, saying the terrifying tropical disease is out of control.

With defaults in recent history, and dwindling oil reserves it will be interesting to see how this decision turns out. From the article: "Congress last month approved legislation to start a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currency">digital currency</a></span> for use alongside the U.S. dollar, the official tender in Ecuador. Once signed into law, the country will begin using the as-yet-unnamed currency as soon as October. A monetary authority will be established to regulate the money, which will be backed by 'liquid assets.'” <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                If I've learned anything from watching The Wire, it's that, after committing a murder, you want to make sure your gun is good and submerged after you inevitably toss it in some body of water. I suppose the same goes for if you happen to go on a burglary spree. Unfortunately for one alleged criminal in New York, he didn't hide the his weapons well enough: Local police in Clayton, New York called on a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> company to scan a marsh in the town where they suspected five stolen rifles had been stashed. The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> found them, no problem. Indeed, 22-year-old Tyler Farmer was arrested on several counts of grand larceny, burglary, criminal mischief, and possession of a controlled substance—he allegedly stole at least five rifles, jewelry, medicine, and, oddly enough, a canoe.  The Jefferson County Sheriff's office said that Horizon Aerial Media Services, a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> photography business in the area, helped them recover some of the items. "It's not that dramatic, but we got a call from the detectives—they said they thought a few of the firearms might be in the marsh, but they were having trouble searching it themselves," Jason Desjardins, the business owner, told me. "We searched, flew a couple feet above the marsh and when we looked at the video, you could the the reflections of something [that looked like a gun] beneath the surface. As vague as it sounded, it worked. That's where it was." Desjardins says the police department didn't pay him for his work, but with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s often being villainized by police, and commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> companies working in a legal grey area, he says that he's happy to help with anything that might change that perception. Lots of police departments are looking into <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, and some of them have already bought them.

                                Katie Jennings / Business Insider The Mount Sinai patient who made New York City news when the hospital announced he was being tested for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> turns out not to have the disease, Mount Sinai confirmed in a statement today. Here is the hospital's statement in full: We would like to report that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that the patient kept in isolation since Monday, August 4, 2014 at The Mount Sinai Hospital has tested negative for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> Virus Disease (EVD). The patient is in stable condition, is improving, and remains in the care of our physicians and nurses. The unidentified male patient captured the attention of much of New York City when he showed up in the emergency room on August 4 with "high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms" after a recent trip to West Africa, triggering standard protocols to test for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>. Mount Sinai's chief medical officer said in a press conference that "odds are it's not <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>," and the New York City Health Department announced that "the patient is unlikely to have <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>," so the negative test result is somewhat expected. Symptoms of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and often bleeding.

                                The Green Army will plant lots of trees: good for mopping up carbon, but not always good for water catchments.Britta Campion/AAPImage Should we pick and choose our climate strategies based on how water-wise they are? As our new research published in Climatic Change shows, some activities aimed at tackling greenhouse emissions can also consume large amounts of water. In a water-poor country like Australia, this can make a real difference in the relative economic attractiveness of these strategies. In particular, wide-scale planting of trees to store carbon can be very water-intensive, and we should therefore consider carefully where we do it. However, there is good news too. Reducing our electricity demand through energy efficiency and shifting to renewable sources can not only reduce our carbon footprint, but also our water footprint too. Burning coal for electricity consumes water, so if we can reduce this demand and shift to more sustainable technology, more water may become available for the environment and other uses. The water costs of carbon farming Planting trees is a major plank of Australia’s climate policy, to be delivered by programs such as the Green Army and the 20 Million Trees initiative. Although 20 million trees sounds like a lot, at 1000 trees per hectare it only adds up to about 20,000 hectares. But elsewhere there are millions of hectares that could potentially be planted by the carbon forestry industry. The Carbon Farming Initiative, which allows land owners to earn credit for storing carbon in trees and soils, recognises the water impact of forests as a potential issue, and has regulations in place to manage it. These include a list of eligible planting zones, and limits to tree planting in areas that receive enough rainfall to generate water runoff (at least 600 mm a year), which is aimed at stopping trees from sucking up water from river catchments. But there are several loopholes in the regulations, and the National Water Commission, which reviews the planting zones each year, will be abolished in December. Another way to manage the impact of trees on water is to issue licences for commercial forestry, as is happening in South Australia. While this policy has its opponents, it makes sense that water use is accounted for and that users pay for the water they consume. Trees can provide many other benefits, such as creating animal habitat, slowing erosion, reducing salinity, and moderating flooding. We shouldn’t avoid planting trees as a climate strategy, but it needs to be carefully planned on a region-by-region basis across Australia. Care needs to be taken not to harm river catchments. Bram Souffrou/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA What can we do to lessen the impact? Apart from carefully planning where trees are planted, there are some technology choices that can reduce the water footprint of clean energy. Thermal power stations use water to generate steam and to cool the heat generated in electricity production. On average, Australian coal-fired power plants consume about 1.5 million litres of water for each gigawatt hour of electricity production. The five power stations in Victoria’s Latrobe valley use more than 100 gigalitres of water each year - around 300 million litres every day. The potential adoption of solar thermal or geothermal energy in drier areas of the continent could also lead to excessive water demands. There are several other options for cooling thermal power plan. “Dry-cooling” obviously uses far less water, and has already been used at a few power stations, such as Kogan Creek in Queensland. But as it relies on heat exchange with the atmosphere, such power plants operate less efficiently in hotter weather. A solar thermal power plant nearing completion in Nevada incorporates a hybrid cooling system that uses much less water than conventional systems. This means that water can be used for cooling when air temperatures are too high for dry-cooling alone. Solar photovoltaic and wind generators use very little water directly, although they need to be linked to other energy stores and generators to smooth out their power supply. Existing pumped storage hydropower stations in eastern Australia, currently used to back up coal-fired generators, could be used for this purpose. An issue for arid places everywhere Clearly water conservation is an issue in Australia, which is largely an arid country. Even in Australia’s temperate zones, most water is already allocated to other uses. Currently, California is in drought and facing reductions in hydro generation and forced to look for alternative sources of water to cool power plants. Switching to new energy sources and implementing other mitigation strategies will change the places where water consumption occurs in Australia. In the future, water consumption is likely to drop in coal-dominated places like the Latrobe and Hunter valleys, while increasing in places where efforts are made to store carbon in the landscape, and potentially where new renewable power stations are being built. The issue of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=water shortage">water shortage</a></span> is not going away – in fact, it will become more important as more areas of the world experience increasing drought as a result of climate change. Tackling greenhouse emissions is a priority, but it needs to be done in a way that minimises the impacts on water.

                                While Facebook makes you sad, Instagram makes you annoying, and Twitter makes you unfaithful, how connected your state is to the internet correlates to how happy your state is. Given that connectedness is indicative of other things, such as a baseline financial stability, maybe this makes sense, and the results of an analysis conducted by HighspeedInternet.com certainly prove there are exceptions to the rule: Nebraska is the fourth happiest state according to a 2013 poll by the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index—a measure that looks at emotional health, work environment, physical health, and a few other things— but it's 35th in terms of connectedness, according to US census data for percentage of state residents who access the internet from home. Oregon is the third most-connected state, but the 25th happiest state (from what I understand, Portland is not to blame). But happy, yet not terribly connected states like Nebraska, South Dakota and Montana are the exceptions to the loose but evident rule, though: happy states are connected states, and connected states are happy states. Only eight states were found to be 20 or more positions away across the two lists, while three states were exactly in the same spot on each. Image: Highspeedinternet.com How significant is this correlation? As the research team explained The R-square statistic for this linear regression is .38. On behalf of the less-than-statistically nimble (okay, for me), I asked Edwin Ivanauskas, a researcher at Highspeed, what it meant. We were surprised at how high it is. Statistically speaking, 38 percent of happiness can be explained by the level of internet access people have in their state. Whether that's true or not, it seems likely that connectedness at least plays a role in happiness.  The report goes on to note that this is a correlation, not a causality. And even then, something like Gallup's happiness poll, Ivanuskas told me, is actually made of six different scores. These scores include life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behavior, and basic access, he said. With each of these, they are measuring one's present life situation as well as how good they feel about their prospects in the next 5 years. This is very subjective and could be related to even something like the general outlook of people in a region. A more negative culture could easily lead to a lower index score. It's one of those subjective measures that can change due to a huge variety of factors. As for the Census question about how many people access the internet from home, it's easy to imagine that it's a pretty straight indicator of wealth, which to a point makes sense as an indicator of happiness. It sucks being poor, and states like North Dakota and Nebraska passed through the Great Recession better than most places, on the wings of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> and smaller housing bubbles to burst.  The connectivity question can definitely be linked to wealth, Ivanuskas allowed. If someone is connecting to the internet from home they must have internet access. They also need to have a device to connect them, either a traditional pc, laptop, or mobile device like their phone or tablet. I mean, for this correlation to mean much, you'd have to have a lot of faith in a Gallup poll reveal which states are happiest; you're not obliged to think that you'll be happier with the internet in your home. There are clearly factors that affect happiness that are beyond their internet access at home, but that doesn't mean that more access won't affect their happiness. Internet access definitely has a big play in our modern economy. It affects education, commerce, even our social lives, Ivanuskas said, buffeting the internet-as-indicator-not-cause of something else, and also how we can probably expect the correlation to grow. It's interesting that most states with a big difference have a much higher happiness score than their internet access rank would suggest and not the other way around, Ivanuskas said. We don't see as many states that have a low happiness score and an inversely high connectivity level. Except for Oregon. What's up, guys? You wanna talk? I know you've got email, so don't hesitate to drop me a line.

                                While Facebook makes you sad, Instagram makes you annoying, and Twitter makes you unfaithful, how connected your state is to the internet correlates to how happy your state is. Given that connectedness is indicative of other things, such as a baseline financial stability, maybe this makes sense, and the results of an analysis conducted by HighspeedInternet.com certainly prove there are exceptions to the rule: Nebraska is the fourth happiest state according to a 2013 poll by the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index—a measure that looks at emotional health, work environment, physical health, and a few other things— but it's 35th in terms of connectedness, according to US census data for percentage of state residents who access the internet from home. Oregon is the third most-connected state, but the 25th happiest state (from what I understand, Portland is not to blame). But happy, yet not terribly connected states like Nebraska, South Dakota and Montana are the exceptions to the loose but evident rule, though: happy states are connected states, and connected states are happy states. Only eight states were found to be 20 or more positions away across the two lists, while three states were exactly in the same spot on each. Image: Highspeedinternet.com How significant is this correlation? As the research team explained The R-square statistic for this linear regression is .38. On behalf of the less-than-statistically nimble (okay, for me), I asked Edwin Ivanauskas, a researcher at Highspeed, what it meant. We were surprised at how high it is. Statistically speaking, 38 percent of happiness can be explained by the level of internet access people have in their state. Whether that's true or not, it seems likely that connectedness at least plays a role in happiness.  The report goes on to note that this is a correlation, not a causality. And even then, something like Gallup's happiness poll, Ivanuskas told me, is actually made of six different scores.

                                Space war is very likely the next frontier for human conflict, and after spending the past few decades with barely any military at all, Japan is taking practical steps to reach for the stars, for wars. According to a source who leaked the story to the Kyodo news agency, the Japanese Defense Ministry is planning on creating a space force made up of Air Self Defense Force personnel by 2019. At first, they'll be using advanced satellite and telescopic observatory technology on earth to track the heavens for dangerous debris like old rocket parts and satellites still floating around in space. Space debris is no joke, but at the same time, the Japanese space watchmen will be working in conjunction with their American allies, updating US Strategic Command with space related intel on the fourth battlefield. That might just mean watching for Chinese ballistic missiles that have been popping up in space of late. Its no secret China and its North Korean ally have openly been testing ICBM technology that can reach low Earth orbit, which makes the neighboring Japanese very nervous. The same source told Kyodo that the Americans and Japanese have been keeping a close watch on Chinese space ambitions since 2007, when the emerging superpower shot down one of its own satellites with a missile. The missile test, an act of showy geopolitical strength, not only sent debris everywhere on a collision course with other satellites, but it demonstrated that the Chinese can blow stuff up in space with the push of a button on earth.  Alarm bells went off for the Americans and Japanese. In May of this year, as Kyodo reports, both countries formally discussed their increased cooperation in space with one another, a strange move belying other, more worldly geopolitical reasons for their sudden interest in space. Spacealong with the cyber realmmust these days be regarded as one of the key domains for military capability alongside land, sea and air, Peter Felstead, a defense expert and editor of Jane's Defense Weekly, told me via email. If you have hi-res eyes in space, that gives you the jump on whether, for example, North Korea is preparing to launch a ballistic missile (one of which flew directly over Japan in 2009). In addition to worrying about thousands of pieces of space debris floating around Earths orbit, the US and Japan are profoundly concerned about the potential for China to dominate the Asia-Pacific region here on planet Earth.  In recent years, tensions between the Chinese and the Japanese have manifested themselves as a lot of sabre rattling over contested islands in the South China sea. The new space race can be viewed as just an extension of that overall chess match to dominate their spheres of influence. And for the same reason the Japanese are tinkering with their World War II-era pacification, which forced them to largely disarm. The emergence of China means the US needs a major military partner to contain the Chinese, while they make their pivot away from the Middle East and into the Pacific. Chinas increasing military might and manoeuvres in places like the South China Sea are a major spur to the upgrading of Japans military capabilities, said Felstead, adding that the North Korean nuclear threat also remains a continuing fear for Japanese national security. This brewing potential Pacific war has sent the Japanese into a military procurement frenzy. After building themselves their biggest naval destroyer since WWII, theyve been buying a lot of fancy new toys in addition to those they engineer on their own. Japan just bought $372 million worth of Northrop Grummans Global Hawk <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> to outfit their new UAV fleet, and they're outfitting a new futuristic navy, and buying F-35s to counter the potential threat of Chinas own, next generation, the J20 stealth fighter. "The Japanese are developing a lot of defense capabilities on their own without the need to buy them," said Felstead. "Japan has built its own warships (including helicopter destroyers), airlifters, [and] tanks. It has also license-produced US aircraft designs for decades and is now a participant in the international F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme."  All of the earthly armaments Japan is making and taking is forecasting a future where space will be inhabited by the same sort of war machines. Even Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-35 that Japan and every other western ally is in line to procure, has designs for a future where space-specific fighters are the norm. They've announced designs for the SR-72 Blackbird, a space-born, unmanned aircraft Lockheed says will be capable of "speeds up to Mach 6, or six times the speed of sound," enabling the plane to creep up on an "adversary" that "would have no time to react or hide." Pitched as an heir to the SR-71, the SR-72 could also be a spy plane, but Lockheed also mentions that hypersonic aircraft, coupled with hypersonic missiles, could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour. The company says it could be ready as early as 2030. In other words, while NATO nations and allies like Japan wait for their long-delayed and over-budget F-35 shipments, the next big ticket purchase could be autonomous space fighters capable of monitoring or shooting down Chinese missiles in the low Earth orbit.  Japan's moves to extend their military ambitions and infrastructure to space is par for the course as compared to their Western allies. Canada's space agency is a wing of the Department of National Defence, and NASA's own connection with the US Army is well documented. In the end, though, the Japanese military's expansion into space is really an evolution of their conflict with China, dating back centuries: An old war in a new frontier.

                                Space war is very likely the next frontier for human conflict, and after spending the past few decades with barely any military at all, Japan is taking practical steps to reach for the stars, for wars. According to a source who leaked the story to the Kyodo news agency, the Japanese Defense Ministry is planning on creating a space force made up of Air Self Defense Force personnel by 2019. At first, they'll be using advanced satellite and telescopic observatory technology on earth to track the heavens for dangerous debris like old rocket parts and satellites still floating around in space. Space debris is no joke, but at the same time, the Japanese space watchmen will be working in conjunction with their American allies, updating US Strategic Command with space related intel on the fourth battlefield. That might just mean watching for Chinese ballistic missiles that have been popping up in space of late. Its no secret China and its North Korean ally have openly been testing ICBM technology that can reach low Earth orbit, which makes the neighboring Japanese very nervous. The same source told Kyodo that the Americans and Japanese have been keeping a close watch on Chinese space ambitions since 2007, when the emerging superpower shot down one of its own satellites with a missile. The missile test, an act of showy geopolitical strength, not only sent debris everywhere on a collision course with other satellites, but it demonstrated that the Chinese can blow stuff up in space with the push of a button on earth.  Alarm bells went off for the Americans and Japanese. In May of this year, as Kyodo reports, both countries formally discussed their increased cooperation in space with one another, a strange move belying other, more worldly geopolitical reasons for their sudden interest in space. Spacealong with the cyber realmmust these days be regarded as one of the key domains for military capability alongside land, sea and air, Peter Felstead, a defense expert and editor of Jane's Defense Weekly, told me via email. If you have hi-res eyes in space, that gives you the jump on whether, for example, North Korea is preparing to launch a ballistic missile (one of which flew directly over Japan in 2009). In addition to worrying about thousands of pieces of space debris floating around Earths orbit, the US and Japan are profoundly concerned about the potential for China to dominate the Asia-Pacific region here on planet Earth.  In recent years, tensions between the Chinese and the Japanese have manifested themselves as a lot of sabre rattling over contested islands in the South China sea. The new space race can be viewed as just an extension of that overall chess match to dominate their spheres of influence. And for the same reason the Japanese are tinkering with their World War II-era pacification, which forced them to largely disarm. The emergence of China means the US needs a major military partner to contain the Chinese, while they make their pivot away from the Middle East and into the Pacific. Chinas increasing military might and manoeuvres in places like the South China Sea are a major spur to the upgrading of Japans military capabilities, said Felstead, adding that the North Korean nuclear threat also remains a continuing fear for Japanese national security. This brewing potential Pacific war has sent the Japanese into a military procurement frenzy. After building themselves their biggest naval destroyer since WWII, theyve been buying a lot of fancy new toys in addition to those they engineer on their own. Japan just bought $372 million worth of Northrop Grummans Global Hawk <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> to outfit their new UAV fleet, and they're outfitting a new futuristic navy, and buying F-35s to counter the potential threat of Chinas own, next generation, the J20 stealth fighter. "The Japanese are developing a lot of defense capabilities on their own without the need to buy them," said Felstead. "Japan has built its own warships (including helicopter destroyers), airlifters, [and] tanks. It has also license-produced US aircraft designs for decades and is now a participant in the international F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme."  All of the earthly armaments Japan is making and taking is forecasting a future where space will be inhabited by the same sort of war machines. Even Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-35 that Japan and every other western ally is in line to procure, has designs for a future where space-specific fighters are the norm. They've announced designs for the SR-72 Blackbird, a space-born, unmanned aircraft Lockheed says will be capable of "speeds up to Mach 6, or six times the speed of sound," enabling the plane to creep up on an "adversary" that "would have no time to react or hide." Pitched as an heir to the SR-71, the SR-72 could also be a spy plane, but Lockheed also mentions that hypersonic aircraft, coupled with hypersonic missiles, could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour. The company says it could be ready as early as 2030. In other words, while NATO nations and allies like Japan wait for their long-delayed and over-budget F-35 shipments, the next big ticket purchase could be autonomous space fighters capable of monitoring or shooting down Chinese missiles in the low Earth orbit.  Japan's moves to extend their military ambitions and infrastructure to space is par for the course as compared to their Western allies. Canada's space agency is a wing of the Department of National Defence, and NASA's own connection with the US Army is well documented. In the end, though, the Japanese military's expansion into space is really an evolution of their conflict with China, dating back centuries: An old war in a new frontier.

                                Yesterday, police in San Jose issued a statement apologizing for failing to consult the public ahead of acquiring an unmanned aerial vehicle. Hours later, the department released additional documents showing the department considered itself immune from FAA regulation. San Jose Police Department posted its statement yesterday morning, three weeks after a Motherboard-MuckRock report first highlighted that the department had received nearly $7,000 in federal homeland security funds to purchase a unit.  While the SJPD records staff twice denied having any documents on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s even as its bomb squad worked through the year-long application process, last week the department released its grant application materials and documents confirming it acquired a six-rotor Century Neo 660 in January 2014. While grant materials pitch the SJPD <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> as a bomb squad tool to inspect suspicious packages from a distance, the posted statement outlines additional potential uses, which could include dangers such as active shooters, hostage taking, or other such tactical situations where lives might be in immediate danger. The SJPD statement apologized for lack of transparency around the purchase, and committed to consulting the public before deploying the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> or applying for federal licenses to fly: In hindsight, SJPD should have done a better job of communicating the purpose and acquisition of the UAS device to our community.The community should have the opportunity to provide feedback, ask questions, and express their concerns before we move forward with this project.To this end, we will first develop a community outreach plan before we take steps to deploy the UAS. Following the completion of the community outreach efforts, the Department will then develop the policy and procedures that will provide an appropriate and practical framework to guide our operation of the UAS. At the same time, we will continue to research legal implications and Federal Aviation Administration requirements for the operation a UAS by SJPD. We are confident that this technology can improve certain police operational efficiencies and help enhance public and officer safety in specific critical incidents. However, SJPD will not use the UAS until these outreach and procedural steps have been completed and approved. Previous SJPD statements similarly emphasized that the hexacopter will stay on the shelf until R&D analysts have a chance to research what the Federal Aviation Administration requires for law enforcement to fly <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in domestic airspace. But additional documents released yesterday evening indicate that high-level SJPD officers had erroneously concluded months earlier that the department was exempt from FAA regulation. A March 21 memo signed by Chief Larry Esquivel and authored by the SJPD bomb squad commander asserted that FAA regulations are not directed at hobby store-type crafts similar to the one we purchased." A summary of the memo circulated by email to the chief and several other SJPD commanders in early March simplified things further: "The UAV is not a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> are regulated by the FAA. The FAA doesn't regulate our device." The department's confusion reflects a general consensus across the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry that the FAA has not been particularly clear about where its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> regulations are headed.  But in this case, the FAA has long made clear that all government agencies require authorization to operate an unmanned aerial vehicle in domestic airspace, regardless of the particular body type or where the unit was purchased. Hobby UAVs that weigh less than 55 pounds and fly under 400 feet are exempt from licensing requirements, but hobbyist rules do not apply to governmental applications. In signing off on the memo in March, two months after SJPD purchased its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>, the chief and assistant chief alike called for the city attorney to review its usage. The chief also called for a specific policy to be drafted around UAV implementation, as well as "messaging/outreach to public" as a condition of his approval. Four months later, the SJPD has now committed to seeking FAA authorization and developing a policy for its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> based on public input.

Following the completion of the community outreach efforts, the Department will then develop the policy and procedures that will provide an appropriate and practical framework to guide our operation of the UAS. At the same time, we will continue to research legal implications and Federal Aviation Administration requirements for the operation a UAS by SJPD. We are confident that this technology can improve certain police operational efficiencies and help enhance public and officer safety in specific critical incidents. However, SJPD will not use the UAS until these outreach and procedural steps have been completed and approved. Previous SJPD statements similarly emphasized that the hexacopter will stay on the shelf until R&D analysts have a chance to research what the Federal Aviation Administration requires for law enforcement to fly <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in domestic airspace. But additional documents released yesterday evening indicate that high-level SJPD officers had erroneously concluded months earlier that the department was exempt from FAA regulation. A March 21 memo signed by Chief Larry Esquivel and authored by the SJPD bomb squad commander asserted that FAA regulations are not directed at hobby store-type crafts similar to the one we purchased." A summary of the memo circulated by email to the chief and several other SJPD commanders in early March simplified things further: "The UAV is not a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> are regulated by the FAA. The FAA doesn't regulate our device." The department's confusion reflects a general consensus across the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry that the FAA has not been particularly clear about where its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> regulations are headed.  But in this case, the FAA has long made clear that all government agencies require authorization to operate an unmanned aerial vehicle in domestic airspace, regardless of the particular body type or where the unit was purchased. Hobby UAVs that weigh less than 55 pounds and fly under 400 feet are exempt from licensing requirements, but hobbyist rules do not apply to governmental applications. In signing off on the memo in March, two months after SJPD purchased its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>, the chief and assistant chief alike called for the city attorney to review its usage. The chief also called for a specific policy to be drafted around UAV implementation, as well as "messaging/outreach to public" as a condition of his approval. Four months later, the SJPD has now committed to seeking FAA authorization and developing a policy for its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> based on public input.

                                Yoshiki Sasai was a leading stem-cell scientist in Japan.EPA In 1987, my father, a scientist at the US National Institute of Health, killed himself after a member of his lab committed scientific fraud and he got caught up in the investigation. So I found the news that Yoshiki Sasai, a Japanese stem-cell scientist, had allegedly committed suicide in the wake of the STAP controversy deeply disturbing. The STAP controversy began in January over two papers published in the journal Nature. In them, researchers claimed to have developed a simple method of creating embryonic-like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>, called STAP (or stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency). The claim, if true, would have given stem-cell research a big boost. But, within months, problems with the papers were spotted and the researchers' institute deemed that the lead author Haruko Obokata was guilty of scientific misconduct. Sasai, one of the leading stem-cell researchers in Japan, was a co-author on both the papers, which have now been retracted from Nature. He was, however, cleared of any charges of misconduct. Neither was my father involved in fraud. But as one of the senior scientists on the research project, my father bore the brunt of institutional criticism. And he seemed to have been far more disturbed by it than the people who were found guilty of the fraud. It is hard for me not to place at least part of the blame for my father’s death on the way the scientific community responds to scientific misconduct. Obviously, fraud is a terrible thing. Nothing provides as deep an existential threat to the scientific enterprise than making up data. But as bad as it is, there is something deeply ugly about the way the scientific community responds to misconduct. We need to deal swiftly with fraud when it is identified. But time after time I have watched not only the accused, but everyone around them, be treated with such sanctimonious disdain. Imagine what it must be like to have devoted your life to science, and then to discover that someone in your midst – someone you have some role in supervising – has committed the ultimate scientific sin. That itself must be disturbing enough. Indeed I remember how upset my father was as he was trying to prove that fraud had taken place. But then imagine what it must feel like to all of a sudden become the focal point for scrutiny – to experience your colleagues and your field casting you aside. It must feel like your whole world is collapsing around you, and not everybody has the mental strength to deal with that. We are all so confident this could never happen to us, that it must be that somebody in a position of power was lax, or that the environment was flawed. It is there in the institutional response. And it is there in the whispers. I still remember how the faculty in my graduate department at the California Institute of Technology talked about David Baltimore when Thereza Imanishi-Kari, a researcher with whom Baltimore had published a paper in the journal Cell, was accused of scientific fraud. (Imanishi-Kari was eventually deemed not guilty.) Given the horrible incentive structure we have in science today, it is somewhat of a miracle that more people don’t make up results on a routine basis. It is important that we identify, and come down hard, on people who cheat (although I wish this would include the far greater number of people who hype their results – something that is ultimately more damaging than the small number of people who commit fraud). But the next time something like this happens, I am begging you to please be careful about how you respond. Recognise that, while invariably fraud involves a failure not just of honesty but of oversight, most of the people involved are honest, decent scientists.

                                Concerns about security of US-trained Afghan military.EPA/Jalil Rezayee The US major-general killed in an insider attack at a military academy near Kabul is the highest-ranked US casualty since 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Another 15 officers were wounded, including a German brigadier-general, in the attack during a high-level meeting at a new defence academy that was modelled on the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Major-General Harold Greene was a widely admired communications specialist who was in Afghanistan to oversee the handover from US to Afghan forces, a key role that made him a particular target for armed opposition groups. The incident brings into focus the more general state of security in Afghanistan at a time when numerous sources are reporting an upsurge in Taliban capabilities, and just as the great majority of coalition forces are concluding their deployments. Just last week, President Hamid Karzai’s powerful cousin, Hashmat Karzai, was killed at an Eid al-Fitr celebration at his home in Kandahar Province after a well-dressed guest came up to him and detonated a suicide vest. Hashmat Karzai was close to one of the two presidential candidates, Ashraf Ghani – and the long drawn-out failure to complete that election has added to the air of uncertainty affecting the country. Security problems have developed in many areas. One example has been extensive difficulties with the logistic support for the 7,000-strong rapid reaction force, a key new element in the Afghan Army’s forces. This is heavily dependent on 350 mobile strike-force vehicles made by the US arms company Textron, but spares and other support for the force have simply not been made available, mainly because coalition forces have not been able to ensure sufficient security for Textron to supply the stores. Murdered: Harold Greene EPA/US Army Yet another problem is that as many as 200,000 weapons supplied to the Afghan National Army (ANA) are not accounted for. Given the worries over Taliban infiltration of the ANA, not forgetting yesterday’s attack, the impact of this could be considerable, stretching over some years. Taliban rising By the end of this year, most of the coalition forces will have left the country. Even now, very few patrols are being conducted and the great majority of coalition troops are engaged in the complicated withdrawal process in which efforts are being made to remove or destroy the billions of dollars of equipment brought into the country over the past 13 years. The United States hopes to maintain a force of around 10,000 troops in the country compared with its peak deployment of 100,000 three years ago. Both the presidential candidates in Afghanistan support this, but the upsurge in Taliban activity is causing considerable concern. They and other armed opposition groups are making gains across the country, extending their reach beyond their previous main areas of control in the south and south-east, and are threatening supply lines close to the capital, Kabul. These groups are also responsible for an upsurge in casualties among the Afghan army and police force which was established last year but by the end of the year was running at around a hundred killed every month. In recent months the defence and interior ministries have actually stopped publishing the casualty figures for the security forces, but UN statistics show a 24% rise in civilian casualties in the first six months of this year compared to the same period a year ago. A further indication of the problem is that civilian casualties are more likely to stem from direct fighting between Taliban and government forces rather than roadside bombs, which shows the way in which the Taliban are now fighting more openly. This presents a change in their approach because frontal attacks on western troops in the past were just too costly. US withdrawal on hold? One other aspect of the changing environment is important. The Taliban may have increased their levels of action against Afghan forces, but they are unlikely to push this too far during the summer months – what is euphemistically called the “fighting season”. If they do, then the United States might decide to keep larger forces in the country in order to support the Afghan government beyond the end of this year. The current intention is to keep those 10,000 or so troops in Afghanistan, partly to handle training missions but also to support the use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> and maintain Special Forces for searching out groups that might link to al-Qaida elements in Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan. If the Taliban get so strong that they are threatening the very survival of the Kabul government, then the Pentagon will argue for keeping far more troops in the country. From the Taliban perspective it is better to demonstrate some of their power without making this excessive. They can then bide their time over the next year, work out just how powerful US forces still are in the country, and then undermine the government slowly while consolidating their control of substantial parts of the country. The war in Afghanistan is largely forgotten in the West with all the attention on Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Nigeria and elsewhere, but it is far from over. And judging by the killing of General Greene, US involvement in Afghanistan will stretch over many years to come.

                                Sophisticated and terrifying: Israeli firepower.EPA/Atef Safadi In the 1982 Lebanon war I served as an Israeli artillery forward observer, my task to pinpoint the PLO’s positions and call in fire from our artillery units. We stayed in the evacuated Al Jamous School, overlooking Beirut. The routine was simple enough: I would pop into the classroom next door from where I would collect the co-ordinates and description of my military targets: “a military camp”, “a mortar”, “an antenna”. I would then return to my room and, looking out of the windows, I would direct our fire on the targets. From time to time I would pause to let the air force get in to drop its munitions; and the navy would fire from the sea. Beirut, in the summer of 1982, was all burning up – a city on fire. There was a purpose to this massive bombardment: to hit Yasser Arafat’s guerrilla force and its weapons – and also put pressure on the Lebanese, particularly those living inside Beirut with no water, food and electricity, so they demanded Arafat get out of Beirut which would then stop our assault. In the end, a Lebanese military officer by the name of Jonny Abdu confronted Arafat who left Lebanon and moved to Tunisa. Looking back now, I’m appalled by our brutal bombing of Beirut. Was it justified to turn this beautiful city into a Middle Eastern Dresden and kill hundreds of innocent civilians in the process? Now to Gaza where, like in 1982 Beirut, the Israeli army is using overwhelming military power to locate and destroy Hamas’s tunnels, to stop them firing rockets into Israel – and also to put pressure on the Gazans (as we had pressured the Beirutis) so they turn their backs on Hamas as a political force. In the process, just as in Lebanon, hundreds of innocent Palestinians have been killed and parts of Gaza, as some sections of 1982 Beirut, have been turned into wastelands. Even worst, UN schools in Gaza which are shelters to more than 250,000 refugees, and their hospitals have also been hit by Israeli artillery and bombs. Wayward artillery Can anything be done so that in the next round between Israel and Hamas, which is inevitable, there would be fewer innocent civilian casualties? The answer to this question is yes. It is indeed possible to reduce the number of casualties on the Palestinian side, but this would require a modification of the Israeli army’s rules of engagement, namely the way it operates, particularly when in close proximity to schools, hospitals and other shelters. On the receiving end. EPA/Mohammed Saber For example, as an artillery officer I know that even now – with advanced technologies – artillery fire is unreliable. As an artillery forward observer, I always looked up to the sky, praying my shells hit the targets and not land on my head. Artillery shells have a strange habit of going astray. In 1996, in southern Lebanon, wayward Israeli artillery shells landed on a UN compound near the village of Qana, killing 106 innocent people. In the current Gaza war many of the innocent casualties were victims of artillery shells landing in the wrong place. What’s needed here is to ensure that heavy artillery is not used in Gaza’s urban areas – particularly not near schools and hospitals. As for Israeli attacks from the air, at the moment, Israeli pilots, or those who dispatch them, can choose from a range of bombs weighing from 250-1,000kg. They often opt for the latter, as they are big enough to destroy the target completely – and the pilots are confident they can hit the target accurately, as they often do. The problem is that the collateral damage of such big bombs is catastrophic in densely populated Gaza; it destroys not only the intended targets but also causes massive damage to nearby structures and kills non-combatants. Such big bombs must be banned altogether from being used in the vicinity of shelters, schools and hospitals. Hannibal Protocol Finally, certain practices employed by the Israeli army should not be allowed to be used, most notably the “Hannibal Protocol”, which is the IDF’s procedure for preventing soldiers from falling into enemy hands. The Hannibal Protocol is yet another product of Israel’s Lebanon wars: a procedure to be used in the first minutes and hours after a possible abduction of an Israeli soldier. It calls on the military to dramatically escalate attacks in the vicinity of any kidnapping – to strike at bridges, roads, houses, cars – everything, in fact, to prevent the captors from disappearing with the abducted soldier. When the IDF thought – wrongly as it turned out - that one of its officers had been abducted by Hamas in the southern Gaza Strip, the Hannibal protocol was activated to a most devastating effect. The army used everything at its disposal – tanks, artillery, aeroplanes, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> – and pounded vast areas in Rafah, causing enormous damage, killing and wounding scores of innocent Palestinians. The brutal Hannibal procedure seems to me to break all rules of war. It should be thrown out of the window and never used again in Gaza. What will ultimately stop the death of innocent Palestinians and Israelis is a peace deal putting an end to the conflict. But in the meantime, a modification of the Israeli rules of engagement could reduce the number of innocent casualties. In 2010, following Israel’s Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip which resulted in hundreds of Palestinian casualties, the IDF produced a document calling on military commanders, operating in densely populated areas, to “exercise judgement and use more accurate weapons, or lower-impact weapons”. It seems, judging from the sheer number of Palestinian casualties in the current Gaza war, that the Israelis are not following their own rules – or the rules were produced at the time as a PR exercise to silence international criticism. There’s no reason to think the Israelis couldn’t change their rules, though. We have international conventions banning, for instance, the use of chemical weapons in war, so it is possible, I believe, to also prohibit the use of heavy artillery, big bombs and cruel procedures in densely populated areas such as the Gaza Strip. After all, it is also in Israel’s interest, as the horrific pictures coming out of the Gaza Strip ruin the country’s already tarnished reputation.

                                Roll up.Katling, CC BY-NC-SA Hollywood makes films that excite and exhilarate; films that make us laugh, cry, connect with humanity – and above all make box office bucks along the way. While most of us would happily say we were going to see an action movie, what about the latest health flick? Three years ago we began compiling a list of health-themed films that could help teach medical students. Our initial criteria was that any film should have a minimum tomatometer rating of 70% on online rating website Rotten Tomatoes. From an initial list of 15, we now now have 32 recommended films that students choose from to review and present in class. Here’s a short list of some of my favourites: 1. Contagion (2011) Let’s get outta here. Alphab.fr, CC BY A star-studded cast battle to contain a new deadly virus. The film tackles the issue of how health officials and doctors respond to a pandemic but also the ethics around how scarce resources could be allocated in a time of crisis. While the virus wasn’t real, the portrayal of the health professional response to pandemic was realistic. The fear of deadly viruses is never very far away in the public imagination – take the current <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus outbreak in West Africa. To plan well for something like this covers policymakers, drug makers, pathologists and a sense of social responsibility from everyone. Tomatometer rating: 84%. Box office takings: US$135.4m 2. Sicko (2007) Moore insurance needed. Shannon Kringen, CC BY Filmmaker Michael Moore’s documentary on the US healthcare system was an eye-opener, detailing the politics of providing healthcare and the tension between personal and governmental responsibility for health. It also covers the influence that multinational corporations (in this case insurance and pharmaceutical companies) have on the health choices people make. Ultimately, Moore takes a critical stance of the system in the US and the its failure to cover its citizens – he found nearly 50m Americans with no health cover at all. Heated political fighting over president Barack Obama’s introduction of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which aimed to make health insurance more affordable shows just how live the issue still is. Tomatometer rating: 92%. Box office takings: US$36m 3. Milk (2008) Milk and White completely incompatible. CC BY-NC Directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Sean Penn as the eponymous Harvey Milk. In 1977 Milk became the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in the US before he was assassinated – by a resentful Dan White (played by Josh Brolin) – the following year. The film earned eight nominations and two Oscars and takes on issues around sexual orientation and prejudice but also about society and later ignorance around an emerging disease: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDs">AIDs</a></span>. Tomatometer rating: 94%. Box office takings: US$54.5m 4. Super-Size Me (2004) Fries in the face of logic. Gauravonomics, CC BY What happens when one man exclusively eats McDonald’s for one month? Plenty of food for thought with this one … Tomatometer rating: 93%. Box office takings: US$20.6m 5. Amazing Grace (2006) A modern take. Mr Stacey, CC BY-NC The movies that provoke the most discussion among our students – the litmus test for educational value – are not necessarily what you may expect. Not strictly a health film, granted, but with modern health implications. Abolitionist William Wilberforce’s life’s mission to abolish slavery is akin to the contemporary challenge of persuading politicians, faced with a strong tobacco lobby, of the financial as well as health benefits of a smoke free country. Tomatometer rating: 70%. Box office takings: US$32m There are many more that could be added to the list. The most recent to be considered is The Dallas Buyer’s Club (2014), the true story of Ron Woodroof, a Texan who hustled the system to get medication to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> patients in the 1980s after he himself was diagnosed. Our next move is to build up a list that covers psychiatry in the movies – and there will certainly be some rich material here.

                                The news: The world's first commercial space launchpad may not be built in Cape Canaveral or Houston. Instead, the first rockets to lift off from a designated commercial facility will embark from one of North America's poorest — and perhaps, least likely — cities: Brownsville, Texas. Of the Brownsville-Harlingen metro area's nearly half a million residents, 36% live below the national poverty line. Close to a quarter of those 25 or older have only a high school diploma; 37% never graduated high school. Yet this is the city where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> chose to build the world's first commercial launching facility, from which he plans to send up to 12 rockets each year into space. This is huge for Brownsville. Musk was looking for a place at an eastern location relatively close to the equator to take advantage of the Earth's spin. Read More

More than 700 West Africans have died, and the battle is far from over. Who is really to blame? How about greedy pharmaceutical companies? Scientists have made great strides in developing an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccine, but so far exactly zero candidates have made it past the stage of clinical trials. Vaccines, which require billions of dollars to research and develop, rely on funds from pharmaceutical companies. So despite the fact that many vaccines have made it to the first level of testing, they often can't surpass the intervening hurdles without a big push from private corporations. Here's the problem: Pharmaceutical companies, for whom decisions must make sense financially, won't take a risk on investing in a vaccine for a disease that only surfaces periodically in low-income countries. Governments and research universities are supposed to help by filling the funding gap. Read More

Photocopiers, PCs, and video conferencing rooms all rose from being technological novelties to standard tools of corporate life. Researchers at IBM are experimenting with an idea for another: a room where executives can go to talk over business problems with a version of Watson, the computer system that defeated two Jeopardy! champions on TV in 2012.

                                From 1990 to 2010, deaths from chronic kidney disease (CKD) rose by about 82% worldwide—the third largest increase among the top 25 causes of death after <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> (396%) and diabetes (93%). In England, about £1·45 billion was spent on caring for people with CKD in 2009–10, just 1·3% of National Health Service spending, and a substantial proportion of this cost was devoted to renal replacement therapy in the small proportion of patients with kidney failure. In July, the UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its clinical guideline on CKD, aiming to ensure consistent identification of CKD and thereby improve management.

                                There are some articles journal editors will wish they hadn't brought to public attention. But there will also be papers they are immensely grateful to have published. One such Lancet paper is Julio Montaner's truly landmark 2006 viewpoint entitled, rather modestly now looking back, “The case for expanding access to highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] to curb the growth of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> epidemic”. The paper began by charting, since its inception in 1996, the rise and impact of HAART. Montaner and his team went on to hypothesise that, “A prevention-centred approach would therefore argue that treating 100% of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected individuals at once could greatly reduce <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission.

                                AT FIRST glance it would appear that China has gone online, and gone digital, with great gusto.

That is the conclusion of a report published on July 24th by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), a think-tank run by the eponymous consulting firm.

                                JUDGING from the condemnation, Facebook just “friended” Satan. The company has been pilloried for academic research it published, showing that by adjusting its users’ news feeds so that a greater proportion of positive or negative items appeared, it could nudge people to post slightly sunnier or gloomier items themselves. For sociologists, the study provided evidence of “social contagion”—the spread of ideas and moods through imitation and conformity—without face-to-face contact.That Facebook runs similar tests all the time for commercial reasons—to get users to linger longer, or to click on ads—was largely lost on the critics. And the most telling bit went unnoticed: the difference in posting behaviour was between 0.04% and 0.1%. It sounds paltry, and is. But to Facebook’s data scientists, it amounted to a smashing victory. “Given the massive scale,” they noted, “even small effects can have large aggregated consequences.”This may indeed be the unspoken secret of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>.

                                THE star of the show was missing from the skies above the Farnborough air show, Europe’s biggest aerospace get-together, which began on July 14th. The F-35 fighter (pictured), which was to have made its first appearance outside America, is grounded after an engine fire. Not taking to the air when expected is a trait of Lockheed Martin’s jet. It is years behind schedule and stratospherically over budget. Its absence is an embarrassment for Lockheed but, then again, its presence might have reminded the defence officials shopping for kit at Farnborough of just the sort of complex and expensive programme that they want to avoid signing up to in future.Arms-makers are going through a lean period. Some big contracts, such as ones to make bombers, trainer aircraft and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, are still up for grabs in America, the world’s biggest spender. But it and other rich-world governments, struggling to curb their deficits, are trying ever harder to get the most bang for the fewest bucks. The revenues of 17 of the top 20 American weapons-makers shrank in 2013. American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had helped to push global spending to a record $1.7 trillion in 2008. Since then it has plunged by $100...
