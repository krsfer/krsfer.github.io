Some analysts are blaming the plunge on a "margin call" at Hong Kong exchange Bitfinex, which is one of the only platforms that allowed users to borrow funds from peer liquidity providers to trade <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin">bitcoin</a></span>s"><span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin">bitcoin</a></span>s</a></span>. As prices fell through $530, a "cascade" of calls appears to have occurred, according to Raffael Dannielli of MatLabTrading. Tim Swanson, a Business Insider contributor who blogs at Of Numbers, had a more conceptual explanation for the price decline. "It’s unclear if the news itself is leading it because it is hard to quantify and qualify; how do we know it is not manipulated via coordination by whales, Willy bots or exchanges?" he writes. He goes on to say that there is work being done to make exchanges more transparent, and that this could result in a new kind of exchange that supplants those like Bitfinex, whose website contains a minimum amount of information about its operations. This is one of the reasons why Coinometrics is trying to spearhead the Compare The Exchange (CTE) transparency effort, by surveying exchanges to find out what kind practices they implement...While it is unclear what immediate impact regulatory compliance proposals such as Bitlicenses from New York may have on exchanges (e.g., are all fiat-based exchanges depository institutions?), in the long-run the first two generations of exchanges may be living on borrowed time. That is to say, if the first generation was Mt. Gox and, 2nd generation exchanges are Bitfinex and Bitstamp, then the rise of a 3rd generation, potentially regulated or consortium of “self-regulated” exchanges, could eventually implement some of the suggested CTE “best-practices.

                                Lecturers: you can learn a lot from Freddie Mercury.<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Steve Mann">Steve Mann</a></span> Can you imagine attending a lecture on, say, string theory and finding that the lecturer was actually explaining this complex scientific concept using his own words – sung to the tune of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody? It would be a memorable learning experience. It’s also likely that when later asked about string theory you might be inclined to remember some if not all of what you had heard. Theatrical university lecturers have been amalgamating their theatre presentations into their academic lectures for some time. We’ve been walking into the wilder side of educational presentation by making it a little or a lot entertaining. Since I began working as an adult educator, I have been doing just that; combining my musical theatre side with my intellectual presentation side. When I first borrowed from the cabaret repertoire and delivered a lecture on non-verbal communication this way to my undergraduate students over 30 years ago, they remembered it. They were even referring to it as they graduated out of their final year. Since then I have been pushing the boundaries of what constitutes a lecture and, more importantly, what constitutes a conference presentation. Research cabaret The OECD redefined research in 2002 to include performances. I included a cabaret on “Doing a Doctorate” as one of the publications in my doctoral dissertation. Since then I have advanced the idea of cabaret as academic discourse and I now refer to my presentations as cabaret research. I see them both as a way of communicating my research – and also of pushing the boundaries of what constitutes research publication. My latest cabaret addresses the question “what happens when a researcher wants to publish differently?” In these cabarets I open with a song that introduces the idea of presenting ideas. I have recently been using lyrics from the 1989 Stephen Sondheim song [Putting It Together]: a vision’s just a vision if it’s only in your head. It has to come to life. Putting It Together. This catches the audience’s attention. Within a few bars they realise that I can actually sing. I trained with Jenny Heaton, the Sydney-based singing teacher, and also sang with a group called Raglan. As the cabaret progresses I chat a little with the audience. At certain points the music starts playing and I branch into song. The cabaret finishes with a song encouraging the audience also to embrace difference using the lyrics from Our Time, another Sondheim number: It’s our time, breathe it in; worlds to change and worlds to win. Merrily We Roll Along. The shape of the show When I first started writing and performing research cabarets they were two-act cabarets. In the break I would encourage the audience to write rhyming couplets, which I incorporated into the first song of the second act. Now I tend to write a one-act cabaret, which is completed in 40 minutes and leaves time for a few questions. This fits neatly into a one-hour lecture or conference presentation slot. Communicating through songs I use songs to convey ideas because singing has always done this for me. While I was undertaking a post-graduate diploma in radio, film and television I had the opportunity to become a morning chat-show radio broadcaster. I found it easy to select songs to play while my guest and I took a speaking break. I thought that everyone thought in songs. Now I recognise it more as one of the range of intelligences in a view of Howard Gardner‘s Multiple Intelligences. On a broader educational spectrum, there would appear little doubt that when Deborah Kerr sings Getting To Know You to her new class of Siamese students in The King and I, she is telling them about the dilemmas of meeting new people. At the more extreme end of musical theatre, when the witch in Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods pours out her heart about the problems of raising children in Children Will Listen, parents in the audience relate to these ideas – even though they do not see themselves as witches or even malevolent. I used this song for a keynote address to early childhood professionals in the early days of my career as an academic and public speaker. Children Will Listen When I have toured these cabarets to other universities I make clear that my message is not “do as I do”. Singing is not everyone’s strong suit! What I do encourage them to do is to embrace their creative self with their academic or research self and thus explore new ways of communicating the ideas that come out of their research. Some people think of this as emphasising the idea of a researcher’s voice. In the traditional ways of publishing research, the researcher had to be so objective that their humanity was lost. In the current era of research publication, there is a greater awareness that the researcher carries a range of biases or idiosyncrasies into the research. Making the bias and assumptions transparent is a way of showing the rigour of the research. The next big challenge for my ongoing development of this form of academic communication is to write and rehearse a cabaret that will be presented as the keynote address at the Enhancing Practice conference in Toronto next month. This presentation will take in the research I have been undertaking for the past two years and encourage conference participants to consider incorporating reflective practice, reflexive practice and investigative practice into their own work.

                                Rock 'n' roll's demise has been protracted and painful.James Jardine Rock ‘n’ roll is turning 60 … about now. The exact date depends on who is doing the reminiscing. But should this event be treated as a birthday celebration or a memorial? In films such as Torn Curtain (1966) and Frenzy (1972), Alfred Hitchcock was determined to bring murder to the screen in a way that emphasised the sheer physicality of the act – to show how hard it actually is to kill someone. It can be just as difficult to kill a concept. In music, the most basic genre distinctions – classical, jazz, rock – stagger on in the 21st century, despite the best efforts of many to render them defunct. Accounts of rock’s demise have been more protracted and painful to observe than one of Hitchcock’s elongated death scenes. Yet rock has been defined in so many different ways that the very idea of a definitive start (or end) point seems suspect. Most orthodox interpretations of the genre betray a kind of bell curve existence. Here the story begins in the mid-1950s, peaks with The Beatles, then undergoes a long descent through punk and beyond. The decline is so widely accepted that it is hard to deny. The rock canon Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Wikimedia Commons Nothing reinforces the waning of rock music more than the rock canon. Every aesthetic form develops narratives of consecration; no other has seen consecration taken to such repetitive extremes. For decades, listeners have compiled countless lists of rock’s greatest albums in barely altered – always male, Anglo-American dominated – arrangements. The Beatles are immovable at the apex of rock ‘n’ roll glory, something many music scholars agree with audiences on. The sheer volume of Beatles-related reference texts is astonishing. They range from affectionate anthologies (The 2010 Cambridge Companion to The Beatles) to sober examinations (Martin King’s 2013 Men, Masculinity and The Beatles) to post-1960s doomsday tracts (Elijah Wald’s 2009 How The Beatles Destroyed Rock and Roll). Recent debates among nostalgia buffs centre on whether The Beatles' Revolver (1966) album has overtaken Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), long considered the genre’s foremost artefact. For their 2013 book 100 Best Albums of All Time, Australian authors Toby Creswell and Craig Mathieson claim some kind of subversive coup by rejecting Sgt Pepper’s in favour of its predecessor. The Beatles dance with Stockhausen Yet what The Beatles also evoke is rock’s disintegration as a clear-cut style. Reductive takes on their legacy contrast with the innovative nature of their music. The 1967 cover of Sgt Pepper’s gives a major clue here. Peering out morosely from the back row of that famous celebrity gathering is German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose pioneering Hymnen (Anthems) appeared the same year. A melange of dismembered national anthems for tape, electronics and/or orchestra, Hymnen suggests contradictions and cross-fertilisations; it speaks of sonic borders being torn down. The following year, The Beatles were channelling Stockhausen with Revolution 9 from their White Album. Revolution 9 (1968) At the time, in an interview with the New Musical Express, Paul McCartney expressed admiration for Stockhausen and fellow modern composer Luciano Berio, saying he was “sick of doing sounds that people can claim to have heard before”. The Beatles were always looking ahead, so it is ironic that their high points are now frozen in time as insurmountable monuments. One contemporary artist who embraced the mixing of musical categories was English film director Nicolas Roeg. The soundtrack to Walkabout (1971), his key contribution to the new Australian cinema, combined excerpts from Hymnen with an opulent John Barry score and the Rod Stewart song Gasoline Alley. Unfortunately, the subsequent rock canon incorporates diversity only in perverse ways. For instance, Creswell and Mathieson, like many before them, inexplicably claim Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue (1959) as a rock touchstone (supposedly jazz’s great gift to the form, despite Davis, under the influence of Stockhausen and Jimi Hendrix, releasing a wealth of memorable rock-tinged recordings in the 1970s). Meanwhile, inventive new artists are largely shunted out to the margins, ushered there by ageing baby-boomers who long ago pronounced the landscape of rock music to be “thoroughly explored”. A ‘delta of microcultures’ Rock has now devolved into what British writer Simon Reynolds terms “a delta of microcultures”, each itself fragmenting at frightening speed – from metal to rap to alt-country, from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> to new folk to dub-step. Narrow, sentimentalised versions of classic rock history banish these new developments to a “not-rock” wilderness, helping ensure the mummification of the form. While there is much fine rock-inflected music being made today, including by Australians, the contradiction remains that deeply nostalgic celebrations of rock only serve to strangle it as a living form. As long as the acclaim is mostly for what was, not what might come next, the extended death throes of rock will likely continue to play out well past its 60th anniversary.

                                IN EASTERN Sierra Leone the roads are unusually quiet. Checkpoints manned by heavily armed soldiers have blocked all movement to and from the districts of Kailahun and Kenema. The main road to Freetown, the capital, is travelled by just a few motorbikes and cars carrying supplies. In Kenema, a usually heaving taxi rank is all but deserted; its cabs have nowhere to go. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> has hit this region hard, and not just because of the deaths it has caused. The federal government's quarantines have taken their own toll. Businesses are suffering and villagers have complained of shortages. But, even after having declared a state of emergency, the government's precautions are patchy. At the public hospital in Kenema, which treats <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients, visitors pass in and out as they like. There are few safeguards to prevent them from catching and spreading the disease. It has been more than nine months since <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> claimed a two-year-old boy in a village in Guinea--"patient zero" in the current outbreak. But rather than petering out, the virus seems to be ramping up. It has infected nearly 2,000 people in west Africa. Over 1,000 of them have died, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). That is probably an underestimate. Some families, distrustful of outsiders and authorities, are concealing sick relatives. Unlike previous outbreaks, this one has travelled to cities, including crowded Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, which could become a transmission hotspot. On August 8th, for only the third time, the WHO declared a "public health emergency of international concern". Despite the alarm, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is unlikely to become a pandemic. The virus is caught only by direct contact with bodily fluids, such as vomit and blood. It is less contagious than airborne diseases, such as influenza. Each <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> victim usually infects just one or two others, whereas a case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), first reported in Asia in 2003, generates three more. Compared with other infectious diseases in Africa, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is a small-scale killer (see chart). But the virus is devastating for the region nonetheless. The frightful nature of the disease, which can cause vomiting, diarrhoea and uncontrollable bleeding, and the lack of a cure have led to panic and fear. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> sufferers have overwhelmed hospitals, impairing their ability to treat other patients. Quarantines are necessary, but threaten local economies (see "The economic impact of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>: Panicking only makes it worse"). The virus has showed how hard it can be to stop an outbreak and how, despite some progress, the world is still ill-prepared for a formidable new pathogen. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is not the first epidemic to catch the world off-guard. Advances in vaccines and antibiotics in the 20th century led some health experts to discount the threat of infectious disease. The devastating arrival of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, SARS, H5N1 (a strain of bird flu) and H1N1 (commonly dubbed swine flu) exposed that as wishful thinking. In the past two years a type of influenza called H7N9 was found in humans for the first time. A new disease caused by a virus from the same family as SARS, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">Middle East Respiratory Syndrome</a></span> (<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>), emerged in Saudi Arabia and has continued to fester. In response the world has got better at spotting and dealing with troubling viruses. SARS and H5N1, in particular, jolted scientists, companies and governments into action. ProMED and HealthMap, two online reporting systems run by the International Society for Infectious Diseases and Boston Children's Hospital, use a variety of sources to provide quick information on possible outbreaks. Epidemiologists now understand that most dangerous new viruses jump from animals to men, mutating along the way. So America's government is paying independent groups, such as the EcoHealth Alliance, to search for pathogens in places where such viral hopscotch is likely--often where rapid development disrupts animals' natural habitats. New tools for studying a virus's genes make it easier to identify different strains. The goal is to spot viruses early so that the damage they do can be contained. To that end, members of the WHO passed new rules for reporting and responding to outbreaks in 2005. China's handling of H7N9 was a sign of progress. A decade earlier, Chinese officials had concealed information about SARS, allowing that virus to spread. But last year China's government promptly shared samples of H7N9 with laboratories around the world and published its own findings in the New England Journal of Medicine. How to stop a killer The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak is a grisly reminder of how much work remains to be done. The virus first emerged in 1976 in a remote part of Sudan and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, near the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> river. But even though epidemiologists were familiar with the disease, it quietly killed Guineans for four months starting last December. Its symptoms resemble those of more common ailments, such as malaria, which helped to conceal its presence. Apart from a small outbreak in Cote d'Ivoire, this is also the first time that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> has appeared in west Africa. Having revealed a failure in surveillance, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is now exposing how hard it is to contain an outbreak, particularly in poor countries. Stopping <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> should, in theory, be straightforward. There is no cure, but there are ways to treat victims that will maximise their chance of survival and help prevent transmission. Patients should be isolated and kept hydrated, their blood pressure monitored and secondary infections treated. Those who have come into contact with the infected should be watched to see if symptoms develop. If none emerge within 21 days, the person can be deemed virus-free. But all this is labour-intensive. "You still have to have a cadre of people who at the end of the day are able to go out there," explains Ian Lipkin of Columbia University. That depends on strong health systems or substantial international help. In this case, there was neither. The outbreak began in three of the world's poorest countries. Guinea spends $62 per person on health each year, compared with $3,364 in Britain. Sierra Leone has two doctors per 100,000 people, compared with 245 in America (see chart). Such health workers as are available in the countries affected by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> are under severe strain. About 150 have been infected and 80 have died, the WHO said on August 8th. Médecins Sans Frontières, a non-profit organisation that has 680 health workers in the region, now says that its staff "simply cannot do more". Decades of civil war in these countries have made matters worse. Many villagers distrust the government and foreign health workers in particular--they fear that doctors and nurses carry the virus. This has undermined efforts to isolate infected patients and stop the chain of transmission. Education is especially crucial. No family wants to leave a sick loved one or deny him the embraces common in a traditional burial. Yet if the virus is to be stopped, that is what must be done. In the face of such problems, the WHO's power is limited. It has laid out steps that governments should take, including ensuring health workers' security, but all it can do is make recommendations. The agency is already overstretched from dealing with humanitarian crises in the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Syria, as well the ongoing challenge posed by H7N9 and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>. Its budget for outbreaks and crises has declined by 35% since 2010, though it can seek extra money in emergencies. Last month the WHO said $103m was needed to continue the fight against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>; it faces a gap of $79m. Other groups are trying to help. The World Bank says it will devote up to $200m to fight <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, though some of these funds were already allocated to the affected countries. America's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention now has over 50 health experts in west Africa. How much difference this will make is unclear, however--many more doctors and nurses are needed. In the long term, several things will be needed to prevent a repetition of the chaos of this outbreak. The World Bank will direct some of its funding towards improving west Africa's teetering health systems. As African countries get richer, they should invest more in their own health systems, too. Properly staffed, well-supplied clinics would help countries handle not just outbreaks of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, but more common diseases such as malaria and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. Nigeria's health system is hardly a model--its response to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> has been hampered by a strike of government health workers--but it provides a glimpse of how countries might cope with outbreaks in future. The health ministry has been sending text messages detailing symptoms to watch for, protective measures and hotlines to ring to seek care. New vaccines and drugs to treat <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> will also be needed. Some are already being developed, including one called ZMapp, which was given to two infected American health workers. Much has been made of these experimental medications, but none has been properly tested in humans. Nevertheless, on August 12th a WHO committee of scientists and ethicists recommended that their use be allowed in west Africa, subject to certain conditions. Also on that day Canada's government said it would donate up to 1,000 doses of a new <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccine to the WHO. Whether it works or how it will be distributed is still unclear. Of the experimental treatments, ZMapp has attracted the most attention. But given the early stage of the drug's development, there is as yet no system for manufacturing it in bulk, even if it were to prove effective. The toll from this outbreak looks set to rise. But at least the severity of the disease is recognised. At a Kenema coffee shop made of corrugated iron, patrons used to doubt that the virus was real. "<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> no dae," they would declare, in the local krio language. The mood now is different. "<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is there," announced one elderly tea-drinker.

                                A LOT of room in an office is a sign either of a blossoming company or a shrivelling one. Happily for Frank Han, the empty space at Kenandy, a cloud-computing company in Redwood City, a few miles south of San Francisco, indicates the former. As manager of "talent acquisition", he is busy filling it. Since he joined Kenandy last October, Mr Han has recruited 32 of the nearly 80 staff. At some point when hiring half of them, he used LinkedIn. LinkedIn, based a bit farther south in Mountain View, had its origins in 2002 as a "network of people", says Allen Blue, one of its founders. "We had in mind a tool for ourselves," he explains, "and we were entrepreneurs." People starting a business may have a little money, but no office, no team and no big institutions behind them. "So much of what entrepreneurs need is about interrelationships." Since then LinkedIn has spread far beyond Silicon Valley. It is an online contact book, curriculum vitae and publishing platform for anyone wanting to make their way in the world of work. Its membership has almost trebled in the past three years, to 313m (see chart 1); two-thirds of them live outside America. Most are professionals, mainly graduates, neither at the apex of the corporate pyramid nor at its base. "It's a presence in your life that wasn't there a few years ago," says a member who works for a firm of accountants. "You can't walk into a room without everyone having looked everyone else up on LinkedIn." Most members pay nothing to list details of their education and career, to be told about jobs, to "endorse" each other's skills, to read recommended articles-and to be annoyed with endless requests from people wanting to "connect" with them. Some pay a premium subscription for a customised profile, a bigger photograph, and the right to send 25 e-mails a month to other members (even if they are not connections already). Premium subscriptions bring in one-fifth of LinkedIn's revenue, which amounted to $534m in the second quarter, 47% more than a year before. (It reported a small net loss, largely because of a charge for share-based compensation.) Yet LinkedIn is more than just a means for aspiring professionals to make friends and influence people. It has changed the market for their labour-how they find jobs and how employers find them. By bringing so many professionals into one digital place, it has become a honeypot for folk like Mr Han. One corporate recruiter after another calls it a "game-changer". But LinkedIn's ambitions do not end there. They are limited only by the size of the world's labour market. Its chief executive, Jeff Weiner, envisions what he calls a vast "economic graph", connecting people seeking or starting work or wanting more from their careers. That implies an eventual membership of 3 billion-Mr Weiner's estimate of the global labour force. In other words, LinkedIn wants to change not only the business of recruiting, but also the operation of labour markets and, with that, the efficiency of economies. The 60% solution Recruiters are LinkedIn's main source of revenue. They pay for licences to trawl for likely job candidates and to e-mail them about vacancies, as well as for placing advertisements on the site. This business-called "talent solutions"-accounts for about three-fifths of sales. It allows recruiters to be more precise about the groups to search in order to find people to hire-people who attended certain universities, say. Rajesh Ahuja, the senior recruiter in Europe and Asia at Infosys, an Indian software company, focused a recent effort to hire 200 MBA students on graduates of several hundred colleges. LinkedIn's main benefit to recruiters has been to make it easier to identify people who are not looking for a new job, but who might move if the right offer came along. These "passive" jobseekers, says Dan Shapero, head of sales in the firm's talent-solutions business, make up perhaps 60% of the membership (active jobseekers make up 25%; those who will not budge for any money make up the rest). LinkedIn has made it easier for companies to identify such people themselves, rather than rely on recruitment agencies. In that sense, it represents a challenge to the agencies. Mr Ahuja says that two years ago he used external agencies to fill 70% of open positions in Europe. Now their share is 16%. Steven Baert, head of human resources at Novartis, a pharmaceuticals firm, says he hired "at least 250 people through LinkedIn last year when we might have used executive search in the past." The agencies have not been put out of business, but they have to do more than just compile a list of names, which in-house recruiters can now do for themselves. Agencies will still be used in the later stages of hiring-working out who is likely to fit in, for instance. Since LinkedIn greatly increases the number of potential candidates, there also is more sifting to be done. Some recruiters say they are spending as much on agencies as they used to. For the top jobs, LinkedIn is still too public. Denizens of the executive suites often expect a discreet tap on the shoulder from a bespoke headhunting firm. That is why Korn/Ferry, one of the biggest headhunting firms, reported record revenues and profits last year. Even so, LinkedIn is working its way up the greasy pole. Hubert Giraud, head of human resources at Capgemini, a French consulting firm, reports that last year he used it in the hiring of 33 managers in India. "I don't have to pay headhunters hefty money even to reach out to senior people," says Mr Ahuja. Even outside the executive suite, LinkedIn is not ubiquitous. A French rival, Viadeo, is bigger in France and China (see "Viadeo: Nipping at LinkedIn's heels")-although LinkedIn launched a site in simplified Chinese in February. In Germany recruiters are more likely to use Xing. LinkedIn makes planning ahead easier: firms know whom to approach before they start a recruitment drive. "When we're expanding, we've already identified them," says Mr Baert. It improves certain kinds of specialist recruitment because, when trawling for scarce skills, it is better to fish in a bigger pool. Glenn Cook, director of global staffing at Boeing, says LinkedIn is a good source of specialised aircraft mechanics. "You wouldn't necessarily think these folks would be on LinkedIn, but they are." He reckons it is easier to fill posts that used to be vacant for "six or eight months". It is true that LinkedIn makes it easier to lose people as well as to find them, because they are on permanent display to competitors and headhunters. But companies see this glass as half full, not half empty-and, anyway, their employees have joined in large numbers whether they like it or not (see chart 2). Mr Giraud says that when he ran Capgemini's business-process outsourcing unit he encouraged all his 15,000 staff to join. "I thought it would be fantastic to have a nice profile...to make sure our business partners had a clear view of who we were." LinkedIn also helps recruiters scour their own companies for talent: firms are often poor at spotting what is right under their noses. Marie-Bernard Delom, who has the task of identifying high-fliers at Orange, a French telecoms company, is using LinkedIn for that reason. She has commissioned software that combines LinkedIn profiles with internal data. Companies can also see how they measure up against others trying to hire the same people. They can do so using LinkedIn in combination with other sites such as Glassdoor, where people anonymously rate the places where they work or have been interviewed. Mr Shapero calls this a "sales and marketing process", in which companies treat their reputations as employers like brands. They can track how many staff have quit to join the competition, as well as how many are coming the other way. LinkedIn members can "follow" companies they do not work for, another loose indicator of potential interest in a job: both Novartis and Infosys boast 500,000. American tech giants have many more (see chart 3). As LinkedIn attracts more members in more countries and industries, its data will become richer. Put another way, the lines in Mr Weiner's graph will become more numerous-and more useful. He thinks that if you trace the connections between workers, companies and colleges, and if you map people's jobs, qualifications and skills and plot these against employers' demands, you will end up with a step-change improvement in information about labour markets: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> for the world of work. The world's labour exchange And that, in principle, should help labour markets work more smoothly, potentially reducing Europe's youth unemployment rate, for example; or matching some of America's 20m underemployed with its 4.7m vacancies; or helping the millions of Chinese expected to migrate from the countryside to cities to find work. Such hopes are remarkably ambitious. They amount to a gargantuan exercise in eradicating the mismatch between the skills people have and those employers want, or between the places jobs are on offer and those where people live. As Mr Blue concedes, "there are real barriers that we haven't even begun to face yet." LinkedIn is only starting to reach beyond professionals, for example. Eventually it may have even to think, as Amazon, Facebook and Google are doing, about providing internet access in remote parts of the world; but that is far ahead. Still, LinkedIn is starting to do more than just find and fill professional jobs. Undergraduates can see how many of their predecessors have ended up in given companies or professions, to help them plot their own paths. (Those who graduated years ago can do the same for their classmates, and laugh or weep accordingly.) Some companies have begun to use LinkedIn's data to help them decide where to open new offices and factories. By looking at the skills on offer-at least among the network's members-and demand for them in different parts of the United States, LinkedIn's data scientists can identify "hidden gems" where there are plenty of potentially suitable employees but little competition for their services. Perhaps most significant, LinkedIn has started to feel its way beyond professionals. Since early June the number of jobs on its site has jumped from 350,000 to about 1m. As well as openings for software engineers at IBM can be found jobs as delivery drivers for Pizza Hut or on the tills at Home Depot-which until now no one would have expected to find there. This is because LinkedIn has added jobs from employers' websites or human-resources databases to its existing paid advertisements. Unlike paid ads, the new ones are seen only by members who are actively seeking jobs. The idea is being tested only in America so far. But if delivery drivers and checkout clerks start to look for and find jobs on the site, LinkedIn will have taken a step towards becoming a much broader job shop. It is hard to know what its eventual effect might be. Even if Mr Weiner's grand vision were realised, it could not cure global unemployment on its own, though richer data ought to make a difference. In explaining high unemployment rates in Western economies, many economists would put more weight on weak aggregate demand than on a mismatch of location or skills. It is even difficult to quantify the impact of LinkedIn on labour markets so far. In theory, making it easier for people to find better jobs could affect the rate of job turnover within firms: recruiters say they have noticed little impact, and that other factors (such as the economic cycle)-seem to matter more. But no one really knows. As LinkedIn's data pool deepens, its value to researchers as well as its members and corporate customers will increase. Pian Shu, an economist at Harvard Business School, points out that you could compare the career paths of those who graduate in recessions with those who graduate in booms: do the former, as you might suppose, fare worse? Aiding academic research is not LinkedIn's priority. But its interest to economists is a sign of how pervasive it has become. "I'm on there until midnight a lot," says Mr Han, of his quest to find the right people for Kenandy. "I'm hooked."

                                Gartner Hype Cycle 2014 Gartner 2014 For 20 years, consulting firm Gartner have been calling the future of technology using its now iconic “Hype Cycle”. The Hype Cycle: from hype to reality The Hype Cycle breaks the introduction of new technologies into 5 phases starting with the “Technology Trigger”, the first point at which a technology comes to the attention of the press and businesses. Technologies then rapidly become oversold or hyped. This is the point at which expansive claims are made about how technology X is going to radically transform and disrupt and the early innovators push to be amongst the first to ride the wave of excitement that technology generates. The initial hype eventually leads to a “Peak of Inflated Expectations” which is subsequently followed by the crash as it is realised that the technology isn’t going to be adopted in quite the way everyone predicted, nor is it generally as useful. This part leads to a “Trough of Disillusionment” which is accompanied by an increasing number of negative articles, project failures and lessening of interest in the technology generally. For some technologies however, the disillusionment is followed by a gradual increase in a more realistic adoption of the technology which eventually results in a “Plateau of Productivity”. Technologies for the next 10 years For Gartner’s 2014 Hype Cycle, the notable technologies are speech recognition which they are claiming to be well into the productive phase. Certainly mobile phones and increasingly, wearables, have driven the adoption of voice control and interaction and it is definitely usable on a day-to-day basis. Having said that however, Gartner also puts wearable user interfaces as having passed the peak of inlfated expectations and rapidly heading to the trough of disillusionment. Given that Google has based their interface for wearables very heavily on the use of voice, it seems odd that these two technologies would be so far apart according to Gartner. The position of the Internet of Things at the peak of inflated expectations will also come as a disappointment to all of the companies like Cisco that are claiming that we are already well and truly in the era of billions of interconnected and independently communicating devices. The future is lumpy Although the Hype Cycle is a convenient way of visualising the progress of technology from invention to universal use, it over-simplifies the way progress is made in innovation. As science fiction writer William Gibson once said “The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed” Technology innovation is never smooth and never takes a single path. There can be businesses and individuals that are using technologies to radically improve productivity at the same time as almost everyone else is failing to do the same. A good example of this is the hype around “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>”. Whilst everyone acknowledges that we are creating enormous amounts of data that ultimately must hold valuable information and knowledge, very few organisations are attempting, let along succeeding, in finding it. Those that are experts in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> are the companies that have made digitally massive infrastructure their entire existence, companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. Whilst Gartner has predicted that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> will reach the plateau of productivity within 5 - 10 years, it is also possible that it will never get there and that very few companies will have the skills to be able to take advantage of their amassed data. The other issue with Gartner’s representation of the technologies that it surveys is that it doesn’t distinguish between the different categories of technologies. Those that are aimed at consumers as opposed to the business sector. Here again, we are likely to see very different paths to adoption and acceptance of those technologies with very different time frames. What we are increasingly seeing is how technology is increasingly being used to enable a concentration of a very small number of very large companies. In turn, these companies are able to focus their resources on introducing new technologies for the public, rapidly iterating on designs until they work. Wearables from Apple, Google and companies like Samsung is a good example of this. As always with predictions around technology, it is very hard to tell what will be the key technologies next year, let alone in 5 - 10 years time. Given that the Hype Cycle has been with us for 20 years however, my prediction is that it will still be here for the next 20.

                                In the gaming world, "roguelikes" are role-playing video games featuring tile-based mechanics and turn-based gameplay. Typically occupying the space of high fantasy, they seek to explore the labyrinths of the mind. But a new game created by UK-based designer Niall Moody (So Many Jagged Shards, Explosive Transcendental Circulatory System) seeks to turn the roguelike on its head, subverting it into an audio-visual alternate reality where users might hack their way into an entirely new version of the game. Moody's high-concept roguelike variation began as an attempt to build an abstract set of glyphs for his already in-development [encrypted]. (Glyphs in roguelikes are typically characters set against colorful foreground and backgrounds.) What was intended to be a month-long project grew into something much bigger and experimental.  "[encrypted] was originally born out of a conversation with Jonathan Brodsky of Lucky Frame," Moody told me. "We were talking about roguelikes, and how their turn-based nature encourages the designer to focus on the game's systems, and the ways they interact with each other." Instead of concentrating on roguelike gameplay, Moody wanted to fixate on the game's visual aesthetic with ASCII graphics. The fantasy roguelike Brogue, which has players descend into a subterranean dungeon to retrieve an amulet, proved a formative influence. But, Moody wanted to bring something new to roguelikes, while still harkening back to the genre's indie ancestry.  Moody also noted that [encrypted] isn't actually the game's proper title. The game's real name is contained in the four big glyphs on the title screen. So, [encrypted], he said, should also be described as an Alternative Reality Game (ARG). That is, all text in the game, including the title screen and the message display below the main game display, is encrypted English text.  Moody said it's possible to decrypt this text and discover an entirely different aspect of the game. Right now everything needs to be decrypted manually, but for the game's final release, Moody will add "hooks" so that players can code their own decrypter, making the game decrypt itself on the fly. "At the moment, you'd have to decrypt everything manually, which would be fairly masochistic," he said.  As Moody noted, the game borrows heavily from Michael Brough's Zaga-33and 868-Hack, as well as Lucky Frame's Nightmare Cooperative. What Moody likes about this particular lineage of roguelikes is the way they simplify and streamline the game mechanics in comparison to more traditional excursions into the genre.  "Typically, roguelikes have a lot of systems and numbers to keep track of: stats, status effects, XP/leveling, inventories, pets/allies, etc.," Moody explained, "and that's great, but it can make for some incredibly deep games with all sorts of fascinating strategies for the player. From a developer's perspective, though, creating a game like that is an enormous amount of work. There's a reason most of the big roguelikes have been in development for decades." With [encrypted], Moody wanted to create a Brough-like game with fewer systems, one designed specifically to generate interesting interactions. He didn't want any text (English), aiming instead for abstraction, while still allowing players to intuit what is happening. As a result, [encrypted] will allow players to see that each enemy has a particular way of moving, or a specific action to perform. And, after a few plays, Moody said that gamers should be able to predict what will happen on any given turn.  What's also really interesting about [encrypted]] is that it deploys experimental audio alongside the abstract visuals. There are two parts to the game's audio. In the first part, the sound itself is entirely generated by the game, using a collection of synthesizer and audio effects algorithms. In a video Moody posted of his work on this "procedural audio," the sound and visuals "smear" and distort in almost psychedelic fashion.  Moody said that the game incorporates two subtractive synthesizers (where low-pass filters alter the signals' timbre), as well as kick drum, clap, and hi-hat synthesizers. These synths are then run through a sequence of audio effects including two granulators, one delay, a bank of eight tuned comb filters, one distortion, and one combined bit crusher and sample-rate reducer (toggled for explosions). This will result, as Moody described it, in a very dense, distorted sound, with a lot of interesting overtones and resonances. The other part of the game's audio can be found in how the synthesizers are triggered. [encrypted] uses a small collection of simple algorithms to determine when to trigger each synth. This is carried out on a bar-by-bar basis, so each synth has an associated step sequencer, and the game periodically writes new patterns into that sequencer.  "The one exception is the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> (subtractive) synthesizer," said Moody, "which has the same pattern throughout the game in order to sustain its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. Essentially, all the audio in the game is generated entirely from code; there are no samples, and no precomposed musical passages." Moody explained that this means that, when listened to as a standalone piece of music, the audio would not work particularly well. But, in the context of the game, it adds to the game's mesmerizing tension.  "The game does a lot to put pressure on the player, with the constant enemy attacks and environmental hazards forcing them onwards," he said. "And this particular combination of synthesizers and effects and procedural patterns seems to really heighten that pressure." As far as gameplay is concerned, [encrypted] mostly follows the usual roguelike mechanics. It's turn-based, and players can attack the enemies by bumping into them. This form of attack is, as Moody explained, a dangerous proposition, so picking battles carefully will be a big part of the game. And each enemy has a unique ability which players can collect and use themselves after the enemy is vanquished. The ultimate goal is to stay alive as long as possible. Moody is hoping for a September release date, but said that could be a bit optimistic. His progress can nonetheless by charted at Make Game.

                                For those who still imagine the supplement industry as some benevolent alternative to Big Pharma, behold: American vitamin peddlers are being warned against making continued claims of their products' efficacy in treating/curing the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. These warnings come courtesy of the United States' FDA and the WHO and, so far, are only warnings, with the promise of real-life penalties if firms continue pushing dishonest and dangerous marketing campaigns. "Unfortunately, during outbreak situations, fraudulent products that claim to prevent, treat, or cure a disease all too often appear on the market," the FDA warming reads. "By law, dietary supplements cannot claim to prevent or cure disease." Of particular concern is a product called NanoSilver, sold by the Natural Solutions Foundation. The product is basically a solution of tiny silver particles, and purports to be something of a cure-all for infections of any stripe. Silver has demonstrated antimicrobal properties and, in the hands of the supplement industry, this can only mean that it treats whatever disease is handy. And while indeed silver is effective in surface antibiotic applications—as a disinfectant coating for medical devices, or a antimicrobal protectant utilized around public spaces—it is also fairly toxic to humans. And despite the howling chorus of natural heath boosters (just Google "silver particles cure") the concept hasn't really been shown to cure or treat anything once it's inside the human body. Nonetheless, Rima E. Laibow, Natural Solutions Foundation's "medical director," sent a letter to a bunch of African health officials. "There is good reason to believe that there already is a natural solution for, and prevention against, the terrifying novel <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus for which, at this point, no effective treatment or counter measures are thought to exist," she wrote. Laibow goes on to repeat the usual bullshit about silver nanoparticles being a cure for really anything, from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. It stuck in at least one crucial place. The New York Times reports: Nigerias health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, said an unidentified Nigerian scientist living overseas had arranged for Nigeria to get a different experimental medicine, according to Nigerian news outlets. They identified it as NanoSilver, a supplement offered by the Natural Solutions Foundation, which said that it contains microscopic silver particles, although, as a food supplement, it is not tested by regulatory agencies. Silver kills some microbes on surfaces and in wounds, but it can be toxic and is not F.D.A.-approved for systemic use against viruses. After the Times attempted to contact Laibow about her products' claims, a pair of NanoSilver-boosting websites went dark, featuring redirects to a different product called Silver Solution. At least one other supplement is boosting anti-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> properties, Monolaurin, and a rumor is spreading that drinking salt water will do the trick, to dangerous effect. At least two Nigerians have died from downing large amounts of salt. The whole thing has echos of the too-often forgotten Matthias Rath reign of quackery in South Africa in the mid-00s. Rath had been an outspoken antagonist of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> suppression therapies, convincing many that antiretriviral therapies are themselves toxic, a destructive weapon against humans wielded by a malevolent pharma industry. He had an alternative in mind, of course: vitamins. With significant aid from the South African government, Rath conducted a propaganda campaign with the aim of convincing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-positive patients to give up their medications and join his study, where they would be taking vitamins instead. Many thousands of people did, and a great many of them likely died as a direct result. The whole episode was nothing short of monstrous and Rath was eventually barred from continuing his "research" and from making any more bogus claims. It's worth reading Ben Goldacre's account of the episode—and Rath's attempts to silence that account—for the Guardian, which also released a short documentary on the whole horrific mess. (Beware: it's a fully skin-crawling experience.) Unfortunately, unlike Rath's war on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> medication, there is no <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> treatment to go to war against. It's much easier to talk fearful people into something when the alternative is nothing. The Raths of the world might even view the current situation as ideal, an open doorway for spreading junk medicine on poorly educated populations at their most vulnerable.

Rath had been an outspoken antagonist of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> suppression therapies, convincing many that antiretriviral therapies are themselves toxic, a destructive weapon against humans wielded by a malevolent pharma industry. He had an alternative in mind, of course: vitamins. With significant aid from the South African government, Rath conducted a propaganda campaign with the aim of convincing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-positive patients to give up their medications and join his study, where they would be taking vitamins instead. Many thousands of people did, and a great many of them likely died as a direct result. The whole episode was nothing short of monstrous and Rath was eventually barred from continuing his "research" and from making any more bogus claims. It's worth reading Ben Goldacre's account of the episode—and Rath's attempts to silence that account—for the Guardian, which also released a short documentary on the whole horrific mess. (Beware: it's a fully skin-crawling experience.) Unfortunately, unlike Rath's war on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> medication, there is no <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> treatment to go to war against. It's much easier to talk fearful people into something when the alternative is nothing. The Raths of the world might even view the current situation as ideal, an open doorway for spreading junk medicine on poorly educated populations at their most vulnerable.

                                You won't believe dramatic new portrayal of Silk Road... but you should. Johan.V./Flickr, CC BY Alex Oates' debut Fringe play traces the journey of 19-year-old Geordie lad Bruce, as he begins dealing cocaine via the illicit online marketplace Silk Road. Under the guise of a coming of age drama, the play – also entitled Silk Road – sets out to explore some of the issues surrounding the online trade in illegal drugs. As well as having the novelty of being the first play funded by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, experts confirm that Oates' depiction of Silk Road is substantially accurate. In plain terms, the now defunct Silk Road was an international crypto-market – an encrypted, eBay-style marketplace, accessible to anyone with an internet connection, but located beyond the reach of conventional search engines like Google. Silk Road users around the world could anonymously buy and sell illegal drugs, and other black market items, using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. Goods sold on this crypto-market were typically dispatched via conventional mail, and sellers were subject to customer feedback, much like on Amazon. A battle for legitimacy Oates' depiction of the Silk Road community is quietly positive. The playwright explained that as part of his research, he downloaded Tor – a browser which allows users to access the deep web anonymously – and created an account on Silk Road. His impression was of a nice, welcoming, and helpful group of people. Oates said: “I think because they have such a firm political ideology behind them, they want to create a good impression.” Given the negative impacts associated with the consumption, trafficking, and dealing of illegal drugs, audiences could be forgiven for feeling sceptical about Oates' portrayal of ideologically motivated, anonymous drugs traders. But James Martin, a senior criminology lecturer, explained that these conflicting representations are the result of a battle for public legitimacy. Martin explained that online dealers say that they do this for ideological and political reasons, and that they’re making the drugs trade safer for consumers, dealers, and the general public. But according to Martin, law enforcement agencies like the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) are premised on policies that prohibit drugs, and so have a vested interest in promoting and maintaining negative stereotypes of drug dealers, both online and on the streets. Experts broadly agree with Oates' representation: “One of the things people misunderstand about Silk Road is that they think it is purely about drugs,” said Jamie Bartlett, whose new book explores phenomena like Silk Road and the dark web. Bartlett explained that while drugs were central to the site’s modus operandi, its broader, underlying philosophy supports the free market and the use of crypto-technology to guarantee individual liberty. “Silk Road started out with these grand ideas; this commitment to libertarianism, and to nonviolence,” Martin explained. The site’s founder, Dread Pirate Roberts (allegedly Ross Ulbricht), has spoken publicly in an interview with Forbes, about wanting to instigate a global crypto-anarchist revolution. “Silk Road had quite a sophisticated and very explicitly articulated vision,” Martin said. As a self-proclaimed haven of libertarianism, Martin explained that Silk Road’s ideology rested on the notion that the war on drugs and the drug prohibition has made the trade a lot more dangerous, and that services like Silk Road are actually a public good. Market appeal In Oates’ play, things start to go wrong for Bruce when the established local dealer – Mr Shaggy – starts to defend his turf. Shaggy unhesitatingly uses threats, violence, and coercion to manipulate Bruce into a partnership. According to experts, the contrast between the stereotypically aggressive drug dealer on the streets, and the more peaceable, enterprising Silk Road user, is one that holds true in real life. Martin explained that online drug vendors are unable to compete with each other using the tools of conventional dealers, namely violence and intimidation. “It’s a buyers market online, and there are thousands and thousands of dealers who all want your business,” Martin said. So instead, online vendors innovate. “One of the ideas that I explore in my new book, Drugs on the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dark Net">Dark Net</a></span>, is that as a conventional cocaine dealer you need to maintain a hard-man persona, to deter people from messing with you,” explained Martin. But online, dealers are free to create a public image that is more sensitive and might appeal more to customers. Martin said that throughout his studies on crypto-markets, he has observed a convergence with the marketing strategies that are typically associated with the conventional economy, like two-for-one gimmicks and holiday specials. He also referred to the emergence of ethical drugs marketing. The question remains, that if crypto-markets are easily accessible via encrypted browsers like Tor, why aren’t conventional dealers adopting these new methods? Bartlett said his research indicates that online communities tend to attract like-minded people. “If you’re a libertarian tech person who is interested in cryptocurrencies and cryptomarkets, you will find out about sites like Silk Road, and you’re more likely to join them,” he said, labelling the phenomenon a “self-selection bias”. The crack down At the conclusion of Silk Road (the play), Bruce realises that he has left an online “paper” trail – bank account details, compromised encryption keys – and that the authorities are converging on him. This ending mirrors key aspects of what is known about the closure of Silk Road. Both incidents can be interpreted as the result of human error. Martin said that although the closure of Silk Road was very destabilising initially, it “transformed into an act of creative destruction”. The BBC recently reported that the number of adverts for illegal drugs on the dark web has doubled, less than a year after the FBI seized Silk Road. This supports Martin’s claim that there the site’s closure left a huge market share up for grabs. “New sites are trying to outsell each other … it’s created a really dynamic online space, and the crypto-market trade is bigger now than it’s ever been,” he said. Despite claims that the Silk Road bust gave “clear notice” that law enforcement agencies have the motivation and resources to arrest illegal users of crypto-markets, experts thought otherwise. According to John Collins – coordinator of the International Drug Policy Project at LSE – the resources required, as well as the legal complications of enforcing laws across jurisdictions, make the probability of enforcement success quite small. “It would really be a case of pushing back the tide,” he said. Whatever attitude one takes toward drugs, it is obvious that sites like Silk Road challenges stereotypes and raises thought-provoking questions over drugs policy and enforcement. Oates' intelligent representation of these questions in his play Silk Road offers accessible and engaging insights for Edinburgh Fringe-goers.

                                There's no real beating around the bush here: Motherboard has gotten its hands on some horrifying footage of hunting and wild animal abuse in Tanzania, where a company known as Green Mile Safari has been caught allowing its clients to hunt protected animals with semi-automatic weapons, run over animals with jeeps, and otherwise torture animals before killing them. The footage is so graphic, the crimes so egregious that the Dallas Safari Club, in a letter to Tanzania's minister of natural resources and tourism, said "without question, the video depicts some of the most abhorrent displays of unethical hunting behavior and animal abuse ever recorded." When it's done correctly, in an ethical, monitored way, there's an argument to be made that controlled hunting can actually be good for conservation. African hunting blocks are often located in the some of the poorest areas of the continent, where agriculture is impossible and where poachers often run rampant (or, in many cases, the poachers are locals themselves).  Watch: An Inside Look at America's Exotic Animal Trade Hunting inherently brings in an influx of money and law enforcement, so the thinking goes that poaching and monetary burden of endangered animals can be reduced with the practice. That's not what's happening here.  Representatives of Green Mile, owned by Awadh Ally Abdullah and Abdullah Bin Butti Alhamed of the United Arab Emirates (its website is also hosted in the UAE), can be seen in the 2012 "highlight" video above—which is somehow promotional material for the company, and which sources say is cut from a larger, two-hour raw video—shooting wildlife from jeeps, running over a baby gazelle with the jeep, allowing young children to shoot at animals, and capturing a baby zebra and torturing it while it cries and tries to get away.  Repeatedly, hunters on Green Mile Safari trips watch animals writhe as they slowly die. At one point, a hunter shoots a writhing zebra with a rifle attached to a tripod from several feet away. "What you see here are hunters treating this like their personal playground," Mary Rice, the executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency, told me. "We condemn the abuse that's taking place." The abuses originally came to light back in March, but Green Mile Safari, which several Tanzanian media outlets have suggested is well-connected politically, retained its hunting license until July, when Lazaro Nyalandu, the country's minister of natural resources and tourism revoked its permission to hunt. The footage itself has been seen by the Dallas Safari Club and members of Tanzania's parliament, but has not, until now, been released to the public. "Our country and its resources are owned by all Tanzanians. It is strictly prohibited for any person or company both local and foreign to sabotage the countrys economy by destroying the resources, Peter Msigwa, Tanzania's shadow minister of natural resources and tourism said at the time. But Green Mile is fighting that decision: It has threatened to sue the government for revoking its licenses, and there's a chance it could win. After the video was initially shown to Tanzania's parliament, no action was taken, perhaps because Green Mile is well-backed financially from its owners in the UAE. It wasn't until Nyalandu unilaterally revoked the license that hunting tours stopped. Msigwa and Nyalandu did not respond to a Motherboard request for comment, but a representative with Green Mile told me that the government—and the Dallas Safari Club—are to blame for the abuses, which is a fairly dubious claim. "Green Mile Safari Co. Ltd is also wondering why such abuses could have happened in the presence of professional hunters and Government Game Officers!," the company told me in an email. "The so called 'wild animals abuses' as seen in the hunting video were well planned by our business rivals from USA, for reasons best known to them! One will wonder why Dallas Safari Club praised the Minister shortly after he had punished the Green Mile Safari Company." The Dallas Safari Club received a spate of negative attention recently for auctioning off the chance to hunt a black rhino, but there has been no evidence that the club has been involved in any abuses of the magnitude shown in the Green Mile video (or any abuses, really). "It's a video they created and produced of their hunt," Ben Carter, Dallas Safari Club's executive director, told me. "We don't think that paints a very good picture of the hunting community, and that's not what's hunting's about. Anytime we see something like this happening, we're going to speak out about it." The Green Mile representative did not deny that the abuses occurred during Green Mile Safari-sponsored trips, and didn't deny that the abuses happened. The company said that it "learned about the said video through [Dallas Safari Club's] letter." The EIA's Rice, meanwhile, told me that, at the end of the day, Green Mile is responsible for its actions. "Although the clients are involved in the abuse, the hunting company itself are the ones who are liable," she said. "If it's done with integrity and professionalism, the animal is tracked on foot and dispatched with a single shot. There will be a professional hunter will be there to dispatch the animal quickly if the client has been unable to do that." That, clearly, is not what happened here. And it shows the perils and pitfalls of poorly regulating an activity that will inevitably, in the minds of many, be linked to poaching and animal abuse, even when it's done with the utmost care. The problem isn't limited to Tanzania. While there are well-managed safari hunting operations, limited regulation and enforcement has led to corruption and abuses throughout the industry. In one notable case, a rhino horn dealer was arrested after he paid prostitutes to pose as hunters to skirt South African hunting regulations in a bid to quasi-legally export rhino horn from the country. Regardless, allegations of hunting abuse have a long history in Tanzania, and there have been anecdotal stories of things like what you see here happening, but this is the rare, and perhaps first, case in which solid evidence of hunters screwing with and torturing animals has come out.  It probably won't be the last. "We now suspect that many other firms are involved in this illegal practice, Msigwa said last month.

                                The "shock and kill" approach flushes out the infected cells in hiding Bo Insogna/Flickr , CC BY A combination of four drugs can flush out <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected cells from hidden reservoirs in the body and kill them with a boost to the immune system, according to research published in the journal Cell today. The finding takes scientists one step closer to a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> cure. Although the research was done in mice, head of the infectious diseases unit at The Alfred Hospital, Professor Sharon Lewin said it was a significant step in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> cure research. When a person is infected with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, some of the virus can go into hiding by burrowing into the DNA where the immune system can’t see it. This is called <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> latency. In patients on anti-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> drugs, latent virus can persist indefinitely. The “shock-and-kill” approach used in the research induced these hidden or latent viruses to resurface by using a combination of three drugs. “It proves the principle that a combination of drugs that activate latent virus together with antibodies can induce remission – at least in a slightly artificial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected mouse model,” she said. Professor Lewin said the principle wasn’t new. “This has been an idea we have been exploring for many years in test tube models of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> latency and more recently in clinical trials. In the few clinical trials recently completed, a range of drugs that are used for treating cancer could wake up latent virus in people but the infected cell wasn’t killed,” she said. To kill the cells, the researchers boosted the mice’s immune systems using powerful antibodies known as “broadly neutralising antibodies”. More than half (57%) of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected mice treated with the combination activating drugs together with these antibodies could keep the virus under control. Scientia Professor of Medicine David Cooper, director of the Kirby Institute at UNSW said the research represented an important model but added it was difficult to extrapolate the results to humans. “The mice were treated with the antiretroviral therapies within a day or two of infection and that is not the case globally. People don’t usually know they’re infected as soon as that,“ he said. “Many people in low- and middle-income countries aren’t identified until they get an opportunistic infection like tuberculosis and at that late stage, the amount of latent virus is very large,” he added. One unique aspect of the research was the use of three drugs to induce the latent infected cells to come out of hiding. Professor Lewin said there had been clinical trials using one drug to activate the latent virus and it was known that using two drugs to activate latent virus – at least in test tube models – led to a better effect than each alone, but a combination of drugs have not yet been tested in clinical trials. “This study went a step further and used three, showing that three drugs are better than two, which is better than one,” she said. “And these drugs worked in keeping the virus under control when combined with one of these potent antibodies.” Professor Cooper raised concerns about the toxicity of the drug combination used in the research. “One of the agents that they used in the study has been approved to treat a rare type of lymphoma, and it’s fair to say that it’s not a particularly light therapy,” he said. “It’s possible that the other types of drugs they use to shock might have these sort of toxicities. It’s very hard to tell in these mice, what the toxicities of these drugs are.” Both Lewin and Cooper agreed that safety was a key concern when trying to activate latent virus, given antiretroviral therapies were safe and allowed people with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> to have a normal lifespan. “What is interesting here is the role of broadly neutralising antibodies in eliminating latent virus,” Professor Lewin said. “These antibodies have recently been shown in monkeys to work well in preventing infection. And there are studies giving broadly neutralising antibodies to monkeys and humans on antiretroviral treatment to see if they can help keep the virus in remission.” “Whether you need three agents to activate latent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> and whether that’s even feasible given potential drug interactions, I’m not sure. But it is exciting because it shows broadly neutralising antibodies and combination activation could play a role in the kick-and-kill strategy,” she said. “That has not been shown before.”

Someone else has made <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> what it is and has the most power over its destiny. In March, a bewildered retired man faced journalists yelling questions about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=virtual currency">virtual currency</a></span> outside his suburban home in Temple City, California.

Meanwhile, the person arguably most responsible for enabling the currency to swell in value to $7.7 billion, and with the most influence on its future, was hiding in plain sight on the other side of the country, in Amherst, Massachusetts.

Millions of gallons of a cocktail of water, sand and chemicals are injected into the horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale, releasing the gas—and causing violent protests in Europe and parts of America.Geothermal energy, by contrast, has yet to stir much controversy. Most geothermal plants are located where water has seeped down into the Earth’s crust, been heated and forced back up through permeable rock. Drill a well to between 3,000 and 12,000 feet, and the searing water and steam can be released to drive generators.Geothermal is a minnow among power sources. America has the world’s highest installed capacity of geothermal generating plants—3.4 gigawatts’ worth at last count (see first chart)—but they generate only 0.4% of its electricity (see second chart). New “enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS), however, look set to...

                                The news: Civil unrest in response to the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has received the lion's share of media coverage. But as protests continue, the authorities' response has increasingly looked less like police action and more like a crackdown in a war zone. This is partially because American police forces are now equipped to operate in war zones. As U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have gradually come down, military equipment — armored personnel carriers, weapons, tactical uniforms and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> — have become available to virtually every local police force across the country. "The equipment has been added to the armories of police departments that already look and act like military units," wrote the New York Times' Matt Apuzzo. Read More

                                China is betting long-term on unconventional gas, but it is running into problems developing its vast shale resources. China is finding it harder than it expected to unlock a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> boom like the one in North America, calling into question its lofty goals to use natural gas to help clean up its air and control the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.
