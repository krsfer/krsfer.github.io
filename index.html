                                This morning, students at Aston University in Birmingham, England, claimed they'd narrowed down the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, to a writer named Nick Szabo. Forty forensic linguistics majors looked at similarities in language used by Satoshi in his original <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> spec paper and that used by 13 people "regularly referred to as suspects." Matches with Szabo were the strongest.  Dr. Jack Grieve, a lecturer in forensic linguistics at Aston, said: "The number of linguistic similarities between Szabo’s writing and the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> paper is uncanny, none of the other possible authors were anywhere near as good of a match. We are pretty confident that out of the primary suspects Nick Szabo is the main author of the paper, though we can’t rule out the possibility that others contributed." This is the latest instance in which the hunt for Satoshi has landed on Szabo. In December, an anonymous blogger created a WordPress site with the explicit purpose of publishing his linguistic match findings between Szabo and Satoshi. The blogger doubled-down on his claim a month ago, saying his latest research "confirms that Nick Szabo’s writing matches the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> whitepaper, not only in the expressions it uses, but also on hard-to-fabricate style metrics." For a while Hilary Sargent, now with the Boston Globe, was tracking possible Satoshi candidates on her ChartGirl blog. Szabo had figured on the top of her list because, among other things, he'd written about a theoretical technology called "Bit Gold," which bears an uncanny similarity to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. Szabo's personal website contains papers on a galaxy of different topics, including ones key to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>'s technology. Here's a sample of his writing on "Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks": All public key operation can be performed inside an unreadable hardware board or smart card on a machine with a very narrow serial-line connection (ie, it carries only a simple single-use protocol with well-verified security) to a dedicated firewall. This is economical for high traffic servers, but may be less practical for individual users. Besides better security, it has the added advantage that hardware speeds up the public key computations.  And here's a cut from the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> spec paper: As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner. Szabo might be hiding in plain sight. Gavin Andresen, one of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>'s core developers, told Business Insider in an email that he had attended the Princeton <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> conference with Szabo in March. Business Insider has tried calling and emailing several phone numbers and addresses associated with Szabo over the past few months to no avail. In November 2011, Wired's Benjamin Wallace said Szabo had denied it, though it was unclear where and how this occurred. Szabo's most explicit disavowal came in a May 2011 blog post in which he wrote the following on the advent of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and what made it special:  Myself, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai's case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai). Only Finney (RPOW) and Nakamoto were motivated enough to actually implement such a scheme.  Finney, who was the first person to ever receive <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s from Satoshi, explicitly denied being Satoshi. Correspondence between Dai and Satoshi has been catalogued, and Dai has twice stated he does not believe Szabo is Satoshi.  One person who did not feature on that list is Dorian Nakamoto, the elderly California man fingered in a Newsweek magazine cover story as Satoshi. In March, that Nakamoto submitted a letter reiterating his claims in an AP interview that he was not Satoshi. Newsweek has not formally retracted the story, but it did append the letter to the story's web version. In an exclusive comment emailed to Business Insider, Dorian Nakamoto's lawyer, Ethan Kirschner, hammered the publication for using weak evidence and bringing unwanted attention to his client: Even a cursory review of the record shows that Satoshi was incredibly careful about preserving his anonymity. I don't believe Newsweek actually thought they got the right guy. It was drive-by journalism in an effort to relaunch their print edition with a splash. As interest in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> grows, Satoshi's anonymity is increasingly impacting others. Dorian Nakamoto isn't the first person to be falsely accused of inventing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, though he may be the first private person to have the details of his life, including his health history and unemployment, in a national newsmagazine. Hal Finney, an early <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>er and another subject of press speculation, was apparently the victim of an extortion attempt."   The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> community remains almost violently opposed to any outside effort to out Satoshi. He is often referred to simply as "the creator." Leah McGrath Goodman, who reported the Newsweek story, received threats on reddit. At the same time, Kirschner said Satoshi has so far enjoyed the resources to protect himself. But it seems like the pressure for Satoshi to out himself will not go away.

                                Not too long ago, when most people heard the word “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s,” they thought of unmanned military aircraft engaged in highly controversial clandestine operations. But when Jeff Bezos announced that Amazon was testing the idea of delivering packages via <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, he made <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s with popular commercial application suddenly seem like a viable proposition. While <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are unlikely to become a part of our daily lives in the immediate future, they will soon begin taking on much larger roles for businesses and some individual consumers, from delivering groceries to revolutionizing private security, to changing the way farmers manage their crops — perhaps even aerial advertising. We estimate that 12% of an estimated $98 billion in cumulative global spending on aerial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s over the next decade will be for commercial purposes. In a recent report from BI Intelligence, we size the commercial and military <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> market to estimate how big the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry could become, and which industries are most likely to see <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s become part of their business model in the next few years. We also look at what components industries, like GPS and sensors manufacturers, will be working to become <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>-ready. And we assess how <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> development will proceed in light of stiff safety and privacy concerns and regulatory hurdles.  Access The Full Report By Signing Up For A Free Trial Today>> Here are some of the issues and opportunities that will impact how the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry develops:  American regulators plan to phase in commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> flights beginning in 2015, starting with limited flights of small <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s weighing 55 pounds or less. Retail and e-commerce — along with the related logistics and shipping industries — arguably have the most at stake in the wide deployment of civilian and commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> might be the missing link in the shipping chain that allows for nearly immediate e-commerce deliveries.

                                Stephan Lewandowsky, chair of cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol, answered questions posed by the public on Reddit. The Conversation has curated the highlights. Conspiracy theories Under what conditions do conspiracies spread? What can one do to convince people to be more sceptical of extraordinary claims in conspiracy theories? In societies that are not transparent and less democratic, conspiracy theories flourish because the government cannot be trusted. In general, the people who believe in conspiracy theories are low on trust and feel that they have been treated badly by life or society. Countering this is very difficult, but education and reducing inequality will go a long way. Can you name one conspiracy theory that turned out to be true? The tobacco industry is now known to have “conspired” against the public in their efforts to undermine the well-established scientific evidence linking smoking to ill health. One of the US judges famously said60449-8/fulltext): “The US tobacco industry has engaged in a criminal conspiracy for more than 50 years.” What kind of cognitive traits does conspiratorial thinking exhibit? There are some researchers who have linked conspiracy beliefs to personality variables. So yes, it is quite possibly a stable characteristic of some sort. The most striking thing is that conspiratorial thinking can be self-contradictory, for example people think MI6 killed Princess Diana while also thinking that she faked her own death. To what extent do you see climate conspiracists denying climate change science as opposed to denying the feasibility of providing an economically acceptable solution to reversing its effects? Very interesting question. I cannot be certain because I do not have data that speak to this issue directly. However, in general, conspiracism is just one form of “motivated cognition”. There are others, such as worldview defence. The reason worldviews are inflamed by climate change is because of the threat of government interference with the free market that might result from mitigation efforts. It is for this reason that people who cherish free markets are less inclined to oppose mitigation when it is framed as providing an opportunity for the nuclear industry than when it is framed as pollution cuts. Bottom line: It is pretty clear that fear of the solutions drives much opposition to the science. This manifests itself in motivated cognition, and one form of that is conspiracism. That said, it is notable that other science denial – for instance <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> – also involves conspiracism, and the links to worldviews are less clear there. Climate change denial How important are political ideologies in understanding the rejection of climate science? I can ask people four questions about the free market and I have roughly 67% “confidence” (that is, variance) in their attitudes towards climate change. As a conservative, I find myself in the frustrating position of being one of the few among my inner circle who is not a dogmatic climate change sceptic. It’s happening and humanity is contributing in a major way. Something that does frustrate me, however, is misinformation about exactly what steps would need to be taken to seriously combat global warming effects. What are your thoughts on this? Recycling is largely a farce. Yes, it is better to recycle that soda bottle than to throw it out. But what is far better is to reuse it or not use it in the first place. But there’s no political will to move the needle on the economic to support such a system. (I do try to recycle anyway, by the way. I just don’t pretend that it makes any significant difference.) Gasoline use is even worse. The fact is that, without abundant sources of non-fossil-fuel power, we are going to burn every last bit of carbon we can pull out of the earth’s crust. Me driving an electric vehicle (which I don’t, by the way) just makes it that much easier for someone on the other side of the world to fill up their gas tank. I think there is, however, some utility in the example that it sets. If my vegan friends make a dinner that is fantastic and satisfying, maybe their decreased resource consumption gives me some ideas how to reduce my consumption of meat. My neighbour’s electric vehicle might convince me that I don’t need to drive a gas-guzzling SUV, and might help incrementally advance the technology to make a wholesale change in power for transportation possible. Overall, the micro-level stuff is small potatoes, and won’t make a difference without the macro stuff. But I think the micro stuff can help sell the macro stuff, and that’s the reason it matters. Do you think that people with same views (no matter how absurd) will easily find each other and gather around somewhere? Yes, there are cyberghettos and clusterings. This is a problem all in itself already, but to make matters worse, it creates an incentive for politicians to engage in more extremist dialogue. Work by economists has shown that it is advantageous for politicians to be extreme if messages to their followers remained inside an echo chamber. As a consequence, whereas politicians used to compete for the “median voter”, it is now advantageous to be extremist. This has undesirable consequences for us all. How much of an effect has science denial had on the progress of the science itself? It is difficult to quantify, but there is some evidence to suggest that science denial has affected not just public discourse but also science itself. For example, an analysis of media coverage found that the IPCC reports in 2007 were more likely to underestimate than overestimate the risk from climate change. A more recent analysis expanded on this topic and argued that scientists' natural reticence biases them towards cautious estimates rather than alarmism, a tendency they call erring on the side of least drama. Is it a waste of my time trying to convince those that don’t believe in climate change or should I just focus on helping those that do become more educated? The answer is pretty nuanced: There are some people who are so entrenched in their contrarian views that there is little point in talking to them about anything other than solutions. In the end, it doesn’t matter what a person thinks about climate change if they put a solar panel on their roof – and who wouldn’t in Geraldton, Western Australia? However, there are also people who really want to know more, and whose reticence to accept the science arises from lack of information. I would send those people to Skeptical Science. Differentiating between entrenched contrarians and those who are open to knowing more is challenging because sometimes it is difficult to know at the outset. What kind of dialogue may perhaps serve to move the national discussion in a more productive direction, given your insights into the psychology of denial? My views are: first, the public is currently being denied the right to be fully informed about the risks it is facing. Second, there are many reasons for this, from “doubt-mongering” to ideologically-motivated denial. Third, we know from much research on misinformation that people cannot dismiss “noise” or misinformation unless they are given a reason to do so. This is why it is important for the public to understand who the people are who oppose climate science. In a nutshell: underscore the consensus which will move all but the hardcore, and identify who the hardcore contrarians are so the remainder of the population can make an educated choice about who to listen to. I will graduate this year with an MSc in Climate Change. What should someone with my skills be doing in order to do a job which benefits the planet? I think that scientists themselves could refine their messaging. Often they put the uncertainty first, without saying what we do know or without saying that uncertainty is a compelling reason to mitigate. That said, also remember that the problem is compounded by the role of worldviews. To overcome that, emphasising the consensus is only a partial tool.

                                By Sayantani Ghosh, Ashutosh Pandey and Euan Rocha (Reuters) - The troubles at BlackBerry Ltd, which fired more than half its staff and lost more than 90 percent of its market value as consumers shunned its smart phones, might have spelled disaster for the company's hometown of Waterloo, Ontario. More than 450 start-ups opened for business in the twin cities of Waterloo and Kitchener last year, more than four times the number begun in 2009, according to Communitech, a local company that advises them. Often, the new companies are being founded by former BlackBerry employees chasing their entrepreneurial ambitions in a community that's Canada's answer to technology hubs in California and elsewhere. "For those who are trying to get a new tech business off the ground, get it funded, and not get lost in the shadow of Silicon Valley, Waterloo can be the best place to get your company on the map," said Sean McCabe, vice-president of engineering at <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> manufacturer Aeryon Labs Inc in Waterloo.

                                A service is soon to launch in the UK that will enable us to transfer money to other people using just their name and mobile number. Paym is being hailed as a revolution in banking because you can pay people without needing to know their account number or sort code. In many respects it is. Paym cuts out the need for a dash to a cash machine. Distance is also not an issue as you could easily top up your children’s bank balance when they are away from home, solving immediate financial dilemmas. And the main security risk appears to come from user error – the one thing you yourself can actually control. What is Paym? As of 29 April, customers of nine banks including Barclays, Halifax, TSB and Santander can use Paym. Although each will have their own approach to offering the service, the principle remains the same for all. As long as you have registered your mobile number and the receiver of the payment has also registered their mobile number, you should be able to use an app on your phone or an internet banking option to make the payment. It sounds simple because for you, the customer, it is supposed to be. This simplicity has made systems similar to Paym phenomenally successful in many parts of the world. M-Pesa is one particularly popular version that has been operating for several years in India and Kenya. As technology evolved over the past decades, the typical cabled telecommunications structure used in developed nations such as the UK, USA or Australia couldn’t be delivered on the same terms for many African, Asian and South American regions. While many western nations had an existing infrastructure that had evolved over 100 years and could be adapted to make room for more cables, the costs of bringing it in afresh in many developing countries was prohibitively expensive. More recent developments in mobile telecommunications such as 3G and 4G networks, on the other hand, are easier to deploy. The cable costs are low and by strategically positioning the mobile towers needed to run the network, you can reach a large population of customers. The use and trust of this technology in developing countries shows us how it could offer interesting benefits to new markets. We all make one-off payments, where the speed of technology could easily beat the slowness of cheques. Parents probably recall when they have to help out a hapless teen or university student with a cash top-up when they are away from the nest, making Paym a potentially essential service. We could pay babysitters, lend a tenner to a friend and cover school trips for our younger children when they’ve forgotten to mention that it’s today. Additionally, we could find that sole traders, market stalls and micro businesses thrive, knowing that they could have a way for a casual customer who otherwise did not have the cash in their pocket to make an immediate transaction for that artisan product. In fact I am sure that entrepreneurs out there could find other ways of offering services and encourage Paym style payments. And it is a free service Paym assures us that there is little risk in using this service but, as with all financial transactions, it pays to be cautious. Card fraud is a known issue, chip and pin is not infallible and there have been issues with some retailers when using contactless payments. There is a transaction limit of £20 and three transactions a day on contactless payments. That means there is still the potential for a £60 fraud to occur. While this is a relatively small amount, it could still cause financial problems. With Paym, depending on your account and the agreement you have made with your bank, you can transfer up to £250 per day. That’s a significant amount of money if something were to go awry. For a start, you must take care when entering the mobile number of the recipient. That seems obvious but mobile numbers are 11 digits in length and we’ve all typed in the wrong number at some point. You should also include the name of the recipient in the transaction, via your smartphone or web browser application. But as we all know, there are many John Smiths out there, so the probability exists that you could pay someone other than your friend John Smith. But because the UK service links bank accounts, users will avoid the most serious type of crime that affects M-Pesa – the robbery or deception of the agents used to deposit money into the system. With Paym, would have to have knowledge of the passwords and other security mechanisms to use your banking app or online account so you are reasonably well protected in this respect. As you already are already a bank customer, the service like cheque banking, contactless or chip-and-pin is free for you to use. Should you use it? This is certainly a payment technology worth trying. I like using contactless in cafes, for example. Paym seems like a useful way for me to give money to family and friends and I can see potentially useful applications for charities, schools, community groups and microbusinesses too. If you intend to use it, practice with small amounts. Don’t suddenly pay £200 to someone. Give them a very small amount, eventually the opportunity will present itself. Check and double check their phone number. In all transactions, the best way to make sure you have the right number and name is to give them a call on the number you are going to use. This will considerably reduce the risk of unintended errors.

                                GOOGLE splashed out an undisclosed sum of money on April 14th to buy Titan Aerospace, whose solar-powered <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> it plans to use to help deliver wireless internet access to remote parts of the world. Like Google’s new <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, which can reach impressive heights, tech shares soared in the early part of this year. Then in March a sell-off began that battered the stocks of many Silicon Valley stars. The tech-heavy NASDAQ stockmarket index steadied somewhat early this week, and shares in older tech firms like HP and IBM, which are traded on the main market, have done well. But investors and companies are still jittery.Those worried that a new internet bubble pumped up by wild dreams and unabashed greed is now deflating will be watching closely to see whether tech firms’ latest results give further cause for alarm. On April 15th Yahoo published its quarterly earnings, which showed a tiny increase in revenue after excluding the cost of fees paid to its partner websites. Its shares rose on the news. Google was due to report its results the next day, after The Economist went to press.It is not just web firms whose performance is under the microscope. Shares in biotech companies, which adapt and exploit processes found in living organisms to create drugs and other useful products, have also taken a beating. Having risen by 60% last year, the NASDAQ biotech...

                                In 1997, Douglas Rushkoff boldly predicted the emergence a new caste of tech-literate adolescents. He argued that the children of his day would soon blossom into “screenagers”, endowed with effortless advantages over their parents, having been raised from birth on a diet of computers and micro-chipped devices. Fast-forward to 2014: the screenagers have come of age in a world ruled by Twitter and Candy Crush Saga. A substantial body of evidence addresses the ways in which media saturation shapes the identities of children and adolescents. While there are clear benefits to maturing as a digital native, a number of experts are concerned about the physical and psychological health of our screenagers. The perils of media-immersion There are advantages of tech-literacy from an early age such as gaining IT skills that will serve you well in the future but there are risks too. Aside from the dangers of social isolation and physical inactivity, there are also dangers that come not directly from any IT medium itself, but what happens when children are exposed to them. The ability to access pornography or gamble online throws up all kinds of issues when children are involved. Particularly insidious are “foot-in-the-door” products which, combined with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> marketing techniques, specifically target adolescents and stimulate pathological behaviour. For example, a number of free Facebook games, including Zynga Poker and Slotomania, normalise gambling and divorce the thrill of playing from the consequences of losing. The player gets to experience the highs of winning but because there is no money involved, they don’t suffer any real life consequences when they lose. This poses a major risk and could lead to problem gambling in adolescence. Other freemium app and internet games also carry a risk factor for pathological behaviour. So-called “casual games” such as Flappy Bird, Bejeweled and Candy Crush Saga use behavioural conditioning techniques to keep players invested for long stretches, which may inhibit the social development of youngsters. And even if we don’t buy into the moral panic so often spread by the media, there is evidence to suggest that sustained access to pornography can have detrimental effects on young people. Mental health website Psych Central reports that not only is pornography easy to stumble across online (with search terms like “toy” often throwing up adult images) repeated exposure can be over-stimulating and potentially addictive for young people. According to the site, “Cybersex addiction functions in a similar way to any other addiction, leading to a cycle of preoccupation, compulsion, acting out, isolation, self-absorption, shame and depression as well as distorted views of real relationships and intimacy.” Most susceptible to compulsive porn viewing are teens with limited parental support, which also correlates with unsupervised web access. New addictions While the addictiveness of certain activities is reasonably well established, the more general concept of “media addiction” in young people is harder to pin down. For a start, it isn’t easy to define addiction as it applies to any activity, even traditional problems such as gambling. So when it comes to new technologies and services, the picture becomes more confused. It is tempting to discuss “media addiction” as a catch-all term for spending too much time online but there are so many opportunities for digital natives to engage in harmful activities that we ought to think in more detail about the problems that can arise for them. While we might group people together as “Facebook addicts”, for example, there may well be a big difference between someone who spends an unhealthy amount of time growing virtual tomatoes on Farmville and another who might be pathologically engrossed in instant messaging. Starting young These phenomena are disconcerting enough on their own but we also need to address the fact that for today’s youngsters, the process of media immersion often begins in very early childhood. Last year, campaign group Common Sense Media and electronics company VTech carried out a survey of 1,463 parents with children aged under eight in the US and found 75% had access to smart devices. This was up from 52% in 2011. This suggests that by the time they hit their teens, there is a high probability that young children will be active participants in global information networks. Whereas children of the 1990s were raised on a diet of discontinuous digital media (MTV and 16-bit gaming), the next wave of screenagers will hold multiple social media accounts, exposing them to all the hazards this level of connectivity implies. From underage users viewing gambling as a source of wealth to adolescents whose formative sexuality is filtered through internet porn, the influence of media-immersion on developing minds is disquieting. One can only imagine the mental state of young people when a universe of information, temptations and perils can be carried around in their pocket. While it’s obvious that internet-use carries huge advantages for young people, they also need to be educated about the dangers before addictions develop.

He has also carried out consultancy for numerous gaming companies in the area of social responsibility and responsible gaming.

But the models may hide rather than reveal the deepest sources of social ills. In 1969, Playboy published a long, freewheeling interview with Marshall McLuhan in which the media theorist and sixties icon sketched a portrait of the future that was at once seductive and repellent. Noting the ability of digital computers to analyze data and communicate messages, he predicted that the machines eventually would be deployed to fine-tune society’s workings. “The computer can be used to direct a network of global thermostats to pattern life in ways that will optimize human awareness,” he said. “Already, it’s technologically feasible to employ the computer to program societies in beneficial ways.” He acknowledged that such centralized control raised the specter of “brainwashing, or far worse,” but he stressed that “the programming of societies could actually be conducted quite constructively and humanistically.”

                                Condoms break, contraceptive pills are missed and in the throes of passion, contraception might be overlooked. So from time to time, a woman may need emergency contraception, known as the morning-after pill. The morning-after pill is available in Australian pharmacies without prescription. The pharmacist may ask you about what contraception you are using and what other medication you’re taking. But you will not be required to show identification. The most commonly used morning-after pill available in Australia is Postinor. This pill contains the hormone progestogen and can be taken as a single dose (1.5 mg) or as two doses (0.75 mg, 12 hours apart). Both are equally as effective. How does it work? The chance of pregnancy is greatest in the two days leading up to and including ovulation. An egg lives for 24 hours and sperm can live for up to three to five days, therefore conception can occur several days after sex. The morning-after pill works by delaying the increase in the hormone that starts ovulation, the release of an egg. By delaying or stopping the egg from being released, the sperm can’t reach the egg and pregnancy can’t occur. The morning-after pill therefore needs to be taken before the hormone surge occurs; its effectiveness decreases the closer it’s given to ovulation and it is not effective if given after fertilisation has occurred. Copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) are an alternative method of contraception and can be inserted up to five days after unprotected sex. Depending on the type, IUDs protect against pregnancy for five or ten years. In the past, the morning-after pill has been thought to prevent implantation and has therefore been termed an abortifacient. This is categorically incorrect. Implantation can only occur if an embryo is created when a sperm enters an egg. If fertilisation has not occurred then an embryo has not been created and therefore the morning-after pill is not preventing implantation. Pharmacists should therefore have no hesitation in dispensing the morning-after pill, no matter what their personal beliefs on abortion. How effective is it? The earlier the morning-after pill is taken after unprotected sex, the greater the success in preventing pregnancy. Ideally the pill should be taken within 72 hours, in which case the rate of efficacy is around 85%. If taken after 72 hours, the effectiveness reduces. At 120 hours, the risk of pregnancy is five times greater than if taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex. After taking the morning-after pill, women should use a barrier method of contraception, such as condoms, for the remainder of their cycle. The morning-after pill might delay the next period. But if it’s more than 21 days late, it’s best to take a pregnancy test. Recent research has shown that as a woman’s weight increases, the effectiveness of the morning-after pill decreases. Obese women (with a body mass index of 30 or above) who take the morning-after pill are four times as likely as their healthy weight counterparts to become pregnant. Being obese doesn’t preclude women from taking the morning-after pill but it’s important to note it reduces its efficacy. In such cases, women may choose to have a copper IUD inserted instead. There are medicines that interact with the morning-after pill and potentially make it less effective: some anti-epilepsy medicines, St John’s Wort and drugs for tuberculosis and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. These medicines speed up the breakdown of the morning-after pill in the body. It’s important to tell your pharmacists about other medicines you’re taking in case there is a drug interaction. In such cases, your pharmacist may recommended you take a higher dose of Postinor. Is it safe? There have been no deaths or reports of serious problems after taking the morning-after pill and it’s also safe to use while breastfeeding. If pregnancy does occur, there is no evidence the drug will cause any harm to the fetus. It has never been shown that accessibility to the morning-after pill leads to an increase in use, an increase in unprotected sex or to a decrease in the use of ongoing contraception. It’s important that all women – especially teenagers – are well informed on the availability of the morning-after pill. This information should be given in an impartial manner without judgement.

                                Amazon Web Services gives developers access to massive computing capability. Now hackers have found ways to hijack some accounts and use that power to make money on someone else's dime. Joe Moreno’s bill for Amazon Web Services is usually about $5 a month. But last Thursday, he learned his AWS credentials had been compromised. An unknown person started renting computing power from Amazon on his account, racking up more than $5,300 in charges on servers in Amazon data centers as far away as Tokyo, São Paulo, Sydney, and Singapore. It appeared that he was running processes that "mined" <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>—creating units of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currency">digital currency</a></span> in exchange for processing transactions. We Have Met The Enemy, And He Is Us Given the timing of the attack, Moreno initially thought the Heartbleed bug was to blame, until he tracked down the breach and realized it was his own error. In addition to developers' usernames and passwords for their accounts, AWS uses "access keys" which are easier to include in software. And that's the problem—developers include them in software, including copies of the software they store in public source-code repositories like GitHub. Moreno had uploaded code to a GitHub repository, inadvertently including his Amazon credentials.  You might think this is an isolated case, but a security expert in Australia discovered almost 10,000 AWS credentials in a search of GitHub last month. Ty Miller, founder of security testing firm Threat Intelligence, found exposed credentials for Amazon, Google's Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure in GitHub repositories, but the largest number were for Amazon. "These credentials are likely to provide full access to the AWS account," Miller told ReadWrite. That means hackers could delete data or add data and start new computing processes which could perform just about any task. Amazon appears to be aware of the problem. The company specifically warns developers against including their credentials in code that they upload. But it's not clear how Amazon can police the problem. Amazon For Nothing And Your Servers For Free Moreno discovered the breach to his account after receiving email from Amazon asking him to update his credit-card information. Moreno, a former software developer at Apple, logged in and noticed the charges. He immediately contacted Amazon. "Your AWS credentials have been compromised," the Amazon representative said. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> mining was a common goal of these hackers, though the AWS computing resources could be used for all kinds of money-making schemes. When software consultant Ted Howard learned of Moreno’s experience, he commiserated. On April 5, he had learned that his Amazon account had been hacked. “I immediately changed my password, disabled my access key and created a new key," he told ReadWrite. Howard also believes the breach was likely his fault. After checking his GitHub repository, he found that he had committed a file that contained his AWS access key. “I seem to be incapable of escaping my own stupidity,” he said. But the unintentional publication of AWS credentials appears to be a common problem. It even happened to security researcher Rich Mogull in January. Keys To The Computing Kingdom Howard thought his immediate problem was over, though he still had the bill to settle with Amazon. But on Friday, after communicating with Moreno, he discovered yet another security breach on his AWS account, despite the steps he had already taken to secure it.   After Moreno’s Amazon troubles came to light, Howard logged back into his own Amazon account and saw that 13 new EC2 instances in Oregon had been started—on April 9, days after he learned of $6,000 in fraudulent charges on his account. “Of course I changed my password and disabled my new access key," he said. "This time I didn't even bother creating a new one.” Since he hadn't used the new access key anywhere, or uploaded or shared it anywhere, he was worried. “Whether it's related to Heartbleed is anyone's guess,” Howard said. "It's possible that they still accepted requests with the old access key after I killed it. Perhaps the attacker was notified of the new key somehow. I really have no idea." Amazon: "We've Been Seeing More And More Of This" Later on Friday, Amazon told Howard that the hacker may have used a feature called "Spot Requests" on his account before he reset his credentials. He checked out his account and found many of them. As an Amazon developer, you can bid on unused computing resources via Spot Requests, and when Amazon accepts the price you set, it automatically starts using the designated computing resources. Amazon told Howard he had to check each of Amazon's geographical region for such requests, as deleting one would not affect instances in any other region. "The nefarious way to use this is to set up a ton of requests with a high max price," Howard said. "Even once all the credentials are changed, this request is still present, so new instances continue to be spun up and down over time. This is apparently what happened to me." That's what an Amazon representative told Moreno the day he discovered the breach. The Amazon employee also told Moreno to check his EC2 spot instances in other regions, and predicted he would see high end instances running. Which he did. Like Howard, Moreno changed his password, but took the extra precaution of removing his code from GitHub. That's not a trivial process: Because the way repositories are backed up, his old keys may still be discoverable. A helpful GitHub tutorial explains how to purge files from your repositories permanently and avoid accidental commits in the future. Plugging The Holes Recently, Amazon has changed the way it generates credentials, Moreno and Howard both said. To allow programs to access AWS resources, you used to need an access key ID and a secret access key—strings of characters generated by Amazon. In the past, you could log into your account and retrieve the secret key at any time. That's no longer the case. "If you lose [the secret key], you must disable and generate a new access key," Howard said. An Amazon guide for managing AWS credentials suggests removing, or not generating, an access key for your root account; and using AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) to create temporary security credentials for applications that interact with AWS resources. It also explains how to manage IAM access keys. “We take security very seriously at AWS, and we provide many resources, guidelines and mechanisms to help customers configure AWS services and develop applications using security best practices," an AWS spokesperson said. "When we become aware of potentially exposed credentials, we proactively notify the affected customers and provide guidance on how to secure their access keys.” It seems that Amazon could do more, however. If security researchers can easily scan public sites like GitHub and find access keys, couldn't Amazon do the same, and save itself and its customers from these incidents by immediately deactivating the keys? How To Protect Yourself It may go without saying, but if you've uploaded code to GitHub, you might want to check whether you inadvertently included your credentials for anyone, including hackers, to access. "I'm sure many developers have made the mistake I've made," Moreno said. He and Howard offer the following advice. Use two-factor authentication. Although this would not have helped either Howard or Moreno, additional security through a second type of authentication helps protect email and other accounts which might also hold your cloud keys. Take advantage of it. Never hardcode your cloud computing credentials. Even if you're using a private source-code repository, that may change in the future. You may decide to contribute code to an open-source project, for example. "After looking through my code, I see that I had hardcoded my credentials and then commented out that code, later, when I moved the credentials to a preferences file," Moreno said. But, even that isn't good enough since preferences files are usually checked into repositories with code. Use Identity Access Management. This feature from Amazon lets you create individual accounts that have limited privileges. If you wanted to create an applications that stores its data in S3, you can create an account that only has access to one S3 bucket. "If that app got compromised or those credentials got accidentally checked in to GitHub, then only that particular S3 bucket would be exposed," Howard said. And if that doesn't stop a hack, you'll still want to gather information about what happened. Mogull explained in a post how to take a snapshot and apply forensic analysis to a hack. The most important advice Howard offers? "Don't put your Amazon credentials into source code and then share that source code in a public place like GitHub!" It seems obvious. But it's clear that thousands of developers haven't taken this obvious step. Update: After we published this story, Joe Moreno received this email from Amazon.  no-reply-aws@amazon.com wrote: Hello Joseph, I have good news!  As a one-time exception, we've approved a credit of the charges for April for the amount of $5360.23  This credit will offset the amount of your compromised resources!

                                Science has often come to the rescue when it comes to the world’s big problems, be it the Green Revolution that helped avoid mass starvation or the small pox vaccine that eradicated the disease. There is always hope that scientific innovations will help solve global problems. So can scientists help solve the globe’s ultimate problem: eliminate extreme poverty? In two announcements this month, the governments of the US and UK have made a fresh commitment to try. On 3 April, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) unveiled the Global Development Lab, with the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 using technology-based solutions. While not strictly a physical lab, it is an initiative that will bring together universities, the private sector, governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in order to collectively trial new technological tools to fight poverty. This is an ambitious exercise. The funding reflects that, with USAID committing to US$1 billion per year of support. The ultimate aim is seemingly intractable, but the lab and its partners will aim to develop solutions in water, health, food security and nutrition, energy, education, and climate change, all in the space of only five years. Not many days after USAID’s announcement, on 9 April, the UK government announced the launch of the Newton Fund, a £375m pot designed to improve the research capacities of emerging powers such as Brazil, India and South Africa, and in doing so strengthen ties with Britain. This might seem like a lot of investment in scientific innovation for development. But it is not the first time huge commitments have been made. What after publicly-funded science? Previous initiatives such as the Green Revolution, and attempts to eradicate malaria, among others, represent some of the largest global public investments ever made. After World War II, there has been hope that publicly-funded science would cement peace and that technology would become the foundation of the global economy. While the impacts of these efforts have been far-reaching, they have also come with caveats of sustainability, reach and appropriateness. The Green Revolution never really took off in Africa, attempts to eradicate the mosquito as a means to control malaria have stalled, vaccination programmes struggle to gain acceptance in certain parts of the world, and among certain populations (and not just in developing countries). These examples do not represent miracles, technological panaceas, or broken promises. They represent the enormous complexities of the relationship between science, technology and society. New knowledge on its own cannot solve societal problems, innovation does not automatically engage with pressing need, and technologies more often than not do not reach the people who need them. We have since developed a more critical, possibly jaundiced but also more realistic view of the transformational power of science. Universal education, better communication and international collaboration have not only created new platforms for science, they have created new platforms to engage critically with science and recognise the roots of limitations – diseases of the poor have few treatments, crop yields have stagnated, the internet has remained out of the reach of too many. There are limits to science beyond the limits of technical knowledge, and these limits are often shaped by the limits of innovation to engage with problems of development. That is why the Global Development Lab and Newton Fund are not simply new Green Revolutions or vaccine development initiatives. They recognise the central role of innovation. The Lab aims to create a “new global marketplace of innovations”. Entrepreneurs, investors and corporate leaders are given as much emphasis as inventors, academics and research. There is some consternation that some of the private sector partners – such as Coca-Cola, Cargill and Unilever – that will profit from poverty alleviation. Similarly, the Newton Fund will be administered by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), not the Department for International Development (DFID) that is experienced at handling such programmes. However, the larger aim is an urgent one and such initiatives are desperately needed. Even then, it would be wrong to interpret the launch of the Global Development Lab and Newton Fund within a week of each other as some sort of watershed in how we conceive of the nature of innovation within science for development. Rather it is a sign of an already emerging approach. There have been many initiatives over the past few years that have blurred the boundaries of public and private – global product development partnerships such as the International <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Aids">Aids</a></span> Vaccine Initiative fuelled by the emergence of social entrepreneurship as an alternative to “development” (see for example the excellent The Rise of the Reluctant Innovator) and the emergence of innovation hubs in developing countries (for example iHub in Nairobi). These are reshaping the relationship between science, technology and innovation for development. Slow and steady wins Innovation has historically been built on the interaction between public and private sectors, blurring the dichotomies. It would be a mistake to understand them as mutually exclusive. Social entrepreneurship – where profits are ploughed back into solving social problems – should not be seen as a proxy for NGOs, private-sector science should not be seen as the successor of public-sector science, and the market should not be seen as the sole vehicle for international development. We need to think more critically about the relationship between the public and private sector. And we also need to resist the allure of only scaling up. While the Green Revolution and drug development demonstrate the power of scaling up a solution, thinking only in terms of scale risks privileging high-tech, high-risk solutions over simpler, less exciting solutions that deliver in local contexts. The private sector and entrepreneurs are not a like-for-like replacement for international development and local initiatives. There are pressing needs to build infrastructure, support health and education systems and support governance and civil society structures. These are necessary for science to flourish and for technology to transform. The hope is that both the Global Development Lab and Newton Fund recognise these complexities. They are taking on a big problem where in the past success has been slow.

                                A new Global Investment Framework for Women's and Children's Health demonstrates how investment in women's and children's health will secure high health, social, and economic returns. We costed health systems strengthening and six investment packages for: maternal and newborn health, child health, immunisation, family planning, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, and malaria. Nutrition is a cross-cutting theme. We then used simulation modelling to estimate the health and socioeconomic returns of these investments. Increasing health expenditure by just $5 per person per year up to 2035 in 74 high-burden countries could yield up to nine times that value in economic and social benefits.

Those working in paediatric <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> care are now cautiously optimistic. Comparing the landscape with 10 years ago when <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected infants faced inevitable death, those born with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> now have access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) so that increasing numbers of children are surviving to adolescence and beyond. Coupled with this progress, the number of new infections has substantially decreased (from 450 000 in 2005, to 260 000 in 2012) because of scale-up of interventions to prevent mother-to-child <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission (PMTCT), resulting in a shift of burden of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> towards older children.

                                German auto firm, EDAG, made a stir at this year’s Geneva Motor Show with a fully 3D printed auto body called Genesis. And why not?

                                NOT so long ago, China looked to be the promised land for crypto-currencies. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and its rivals were traded freely and online exchanges proliferated. On one estimate, China accounted for more than half of the world’s trade in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> last year. Near the end of last year, when its price was above $1,000, more than 100,000 coins were being traded daily on BTC China, a local exchange.Alas, those heady days are gone. Prices have plunged below $500 of late and hardly 2,000 coins are now traded daily on BTC China. According to Bobby Lee, the exchange’s founder, “Most investors have left the market.” What happened? The short answer is regulation.In early December China’s central bank declared that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was not a currency. This slowed its rise, but enthusiasts remained unbowed as the declaration fell far short of the outright ban some had feared. Then regulators forbade the firms that act as middlemen between businesses and credit-card networks from working with the exchanges. That was a more serious blow, but exchange operators found ways round the ban (for example, by using related companies to deal with the payment processors).Rumours now suggest that the...

                                In countries that have based their wealth on production, every discovery and innovation that potentially lower production costs attract very strong attention. Since 2007, the discovery and exploitation of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil have put the USA energy industry back on the track to competitive procurement faced with competing nations who have been low costs champions for decades. The new question on the table is to ascertain whether 3D printing can have a comparable impact. [This is a content summary only.

                                It's understood, the twenty-first century will be the century of robots. And there is a lot of talk concerning a subfamily of these machines: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>. While these remotely piloted aircrafts were first developed in a military context, there seems to be no end to their civilian uses.

The company in question is Titan Aerospace, which manufactures what it calls "atmospheric satellites." Unlike traditional satellites, they operate around 20 kilometers (12 miles) above Earth, which is just short of the point of being in orbit. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> such as the Solara 50 look and operate similar to an airplane, but have solar panels on its wings, ...

Mt Gox is a Tokyo-based business founded in 2009 as a trading card exchange (Source: wikipedia.org ).

        Date 20140416. Time 21:41:00 I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me that I may sponge away the writing on this stone!  Charles Dickens
