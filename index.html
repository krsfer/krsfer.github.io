                                The African Development Bank on Tuesday pledged $60 million (45 million euros) to help fight the worst-ever outbreak of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> which is raging across west Africa. The aid will help authorities in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria to strengthen their surveillance and response systems to halt the spread of the deadly disease, president Donald Kaberuka said. "The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic is not only a public health crisis, but an economic crisis... which affects many sectors," he told a press conference. West Africa's <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic is by far the deadliest since the virus was discovered four decades ago in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.

                                How does an American community, a suburb, really, learn overnight how to deal with injuries sustained from tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray, and a militarized police force? Using the internet, of course. Ten days ago, the people of Ferguson, Missouri, had no idea how to help someone who's having a panic attack because they've been pepper sprayed, how to flush a tear gas victim's eyes with a mixture of equal parts Maalox and water, or how to get the lingering effects of tear gas off their clothes.  Now, they're old pros, in part thanks to a network of volunteers and organizations from as far away as Australia and Palestine who have dealt with police brutality and abuse in the past. "I don't think any community, at least in the US, is equipped to deal with getting tear gassed by the people who are supposed to be helping them," Kalaya'an Mendoza, an activist with Amnesty International who has been in Ferguson for much of the last week, told me. "Palestinians have been emailing and sending tips for dealing with tear gas that they use in their own struggle. When people post on Twitter that they've been tear gassed, people are speaking up and saying 'do this, not that.' It's fascinating to see how fast Twitter has figured out how to help." Amnesty International guy helping another man who was tear gassed pretty bad just now. #Ferguson pic.twitter.com/DVk9wBfFX1 — Amanda Wills (@AmandaWills) August 19, 2014 Last night, Mendoza helped a journalist who was having trouble breathing after he'd been tear gassed. In Ferguson, there isn't really a street medicine brigade, with duct-taped red crosses on their shirts, as there were during the civil rights protests of the 1960s and the Occupy protests of a couple years ago.  Instead, the general population has really taken it upon themselves to learn how to treat each others' medical maladies, with the help of Twitter (and people who have learned what to do thanks to Twitter). Mendoza says that if he hadn't been around to help the journalist, someone else likely would have been able to help him eventually. "Being a street medic has become normalized within the scope of being an activist," he said. Here in #Palestine with a collective that is putting together a manual on how to deal w/ tear gas & stun grenades to send to #Ferguson — Shawn Carri (@shawncarrie) August 18, 2014 That's in part, he says, a testament to the way Ferguson residents have banded together in the last week or so (and an unfortunate consequence of having this protest, and the police response to it, spill over into a second week) but it's also thanks to organizations such as the Melbourne Street Medic Collective, which has been organizing people on the ground from the other side of the world. The collective, which earned its stripes during the height of Occupy, has been instrumental in developing health material that can be printed out and handed out to residents of the city. "Over the last few years, we've seen a lot of shit, talked a lot of shit, and learned a lot of shit," a medic with the collective, who goes by the pseudonym John Zoidberg, told me in an email. "We're no stranded to international solidarity and support … even if we can't have a presence on the ground, we can share guides on basic first air techniques." The Melbourne collective has been tweeting information about how to deal with panic attacks, directing people on the ground to injured people, and are generally helping in any way it can. "We mightn't be able to do much but if we can take some of the pressure off the medics on the ground so they can focus on the critical tasks then I'd like to think we've done something positive," Zoidberg added. Social media and ever-present cell phone cameras has allowed the whole world to watch what's happening in Ferguson—but it's also allowed the whole world to offer its support right back.

                                The Voynich Manuscript might have been dropped to Earth by aliens; it might be a medieval cipher whose mystery outlived anyone who had the key; it also might be a prank and moneymaking scheme by some haggard rare bookseller. But whatever the book actually is, Brazilian scientists are pretty certain that the manuscript's text—which is written in a language and alphabet only found in the Voynich itself—isn't just gibberish. There's meaning in there, and complex network modeling or other <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> tools might crack the enigma that has thus far proven unbreakable. Granted, the work led by Dr. Diego Amancio hasn't yet told us anything new about the manuscript, which is named for the antiquarian who came across the medieval-looking book in 1912, Wilfred Voynich. A professor at University of So Paulo's Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Amancio found evidence that indicates, at least, that the manuscript makes some sort of sense. Beyond just revealing the manuscript's secrets, Amancio's work may help to boost the intelligence of bots past the Turing Test, like the impressive or maybe unimpressive software Eugene Gootsman, which famously sort of passed the test early this year. Our research has shown that the Voynich Manuscript presents a great deal of statistical patterns that are similar to those of natural languages, says Amancio. Besides endorsing the existence of some meaning in the text, his conclusions fly in the face of many theories that treat this piece of work as an elaborate prank made by some old-school braggadocio. Fraud theories have long loomed over the studies of the manuscript. Chemical analyses prove that the book was crafted between 1404 and 1439, but much of the book's life, like its meaning, remains shrouded. It began its rise to worldwide fame starting at the beginning of the 20th century, with its rediscovery in Italy, by the Polish bookseller Wilfrid Voynich. Voynich wasn't able to translate the weird book, nor could he find anyone who could. Thanks to his efforts, however, the story of the Voynich Manuscript and its singular Voynichese language has piqued the interest of scientists and cryptographers no less notable than Alan Turing himself. None have succeeded, but people to this day won't give up trying. It's easy to see why: The Voynich Manuscript boasts around 200 pages written in unknown characters, and filled with sketches of bizarre, unrecognizable plants, naked women diving into weird-ass pools, tentacled creatures, and Zodiac constellations. I mean, what's going on here? Image: Wikimedia Commons In his thesis, published on the scientific magazine PLoS One, Amancio applied statistical methods to the text to determine if it was just codified mumbo-jumbo that looks a lot like a text—which frustrated would-be translators have accused it of being—or if its an actual text in an actual language. Instead of considering possible meanings, and attempting to translate, Amancio mapped the words with clusters and connection cables, in what is called complex network modeling. In texts, each distinct word represents a vortex. Each words are connected by an edge if they appear close to the other on it, Amancio said. Programming on C and using the Network 3D software, Amancio managed to create gigantic orbital models in which words and their connections showed themselves according their presence and location within the text. The researcher attested that the Voynich systems are, in 90 percent of cases, similar to those of other known books such as the Bible, indicating that its an actual piece of text in an actual language, and not well planned gibberish. While Voynichese has been accepted as very language-like, at least, by employing concepts such as frequency and intermittence, which measure occurrence and concentration of a term in the text, Amancio was able to discover the manuscripts keywords. The gigantic model created by Diego Amancio What emerged are terms like cthy, gokeedy, and shedy. Although each original Voynichese letter got an equivalent from the Latin alphabet, the results don't make any sense to human beings yet. Lets just say that Amancio sees that as an edge piece of a bigger, complicated puzzle. These words can be studied further by cryptographers and other manuscript scholars," he says. After so much research, even he can only guess at what the book's actual content says. I believe its a compendium of medieval practices involving medicinal recipes, astrological and metaphysical descriptions and fertility rites, as the images imply, he says. FANTASTIC PAST, REAL FUTURE The Voynich Manuscript is held at the Beinecke Library at Yale. Amancio saved himself a trip to New Haven, and instead examined the pages of the book through its digital version, which has opened the Voynich to any willing cryptographer with an internet connection. At the beginning of 2014, Stephen Bax, professor of applied linguistics on Bedforshire University, in the UK, implied that Amancios's hunch is correct after using a totally different approach to the enigma. In an interview with Motherboard, Bax pointed to one of his articles wherein, just like the first Egyptologists, he began establishing meanings starting from capital letters, proper nouns and illustrative images. In this manner, Bax believes he discovered Voynichese words for bull and coriander." His line of work has attracted a great deal of criticism from other scholars though. The website Cipher Mysteries dismissed Bax as that dude who has come crashing in late to the party. Bax, though, shrugs and goes on trying to break the code. In the end, criticism like this is commonplace on the academic universe, and in the manuscripts case, which has attracted its share of crackpots, even more so. Jorge Stolfi, a specialist in natural languages processing, has studied the manuscript for seven years. He believes it to be a transcription of an East Asia language, but the Campinas University (Unicamp) professor avoids stating what the book contains for certain. Even if my hypothesis is correct, I dont dare foreseeing when itll be deciphered," he told FAPESP Magazine in an interview. Image: Wikimedia Commons Another language specialist raised on a hard sciences diet, Osvaldo Oliveira Jr. is a bit more apprehensive regarding the Manuscripts translation. The professor and director for USP So Carlos Physics Institute is openly enthusiastic about the possibilities presented by research that merge data and machine analysis with complex network modeling though. We want to use statistical physics to analyze texts. This is a hardware limitation in 2014, but it may not be so in 2020," he says. Along with Amancio and researchers Eduardo Altmann and Diego Rybski, Osvaldo is a co-author of the article on the manuscript. According to their research, the principles used on the book can also someday be used to identify the authors of unknown documents, as well as determine the most likely meaning for an ambiguous term, and even determine the quality of a translation. If all it takes is more hardware to crack the Voynich manuscript, whose authorship, meaning, and translation have resisted revelation for over a century, it's time to send some processors to Brazil, stat. Making robotic Russian teenagers is one thing, but this is a whole new language game.

                                MONROVIA/GENEVA, Aug 19 (Reuters)- Liberia battled on Tuesday to halt the spread of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> disease in its crowded, run-down oceanside capital Monrovia, recording the most new deaths as fatalities from the world's worst outbreak of the deadly virus rose above 1,200. The epidemic of the hemorrhagic disease, which can kill up to 90 percent of those it infects, is ravaging the three small West African states of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and also has a toehold in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy. As the Geneva-based World Health Organization rushed to ramp up the global response to the outbreak, including emergency food deliveries to quarantined zones, it announced that deaths from it had risen to 1,299 as of Aug. 16, out of 2,240 cases. Between Aug. 14-16, Liberia recorded the most new deaths, 53, followed by Sierra Leone with 17, and Guinea with 14.

                                The internet is a big, black box when it comes to how our data is used by advertisers. Seeing a Gmail ad for something I just emailed a friend about doesn't much faze me anymore, yet I have pretty much no idea how my personal communications data got from the proverbial point A—as a keyword in an email—to its final form as a targeted ad.  X-Ray, an experimental tool that tracks how data turns into advertisements, aims to explain this relationship. Designed by researchers at Columbia University, X-Ray models the correlation between certain keywords, say, "debt," with the ads that return to the user, which might include something about car loans.  The vast bulk of the internet is funded by targeted ads, which use data mining to allow marketers to target us based on our recent searches, emails, and more. By trying to understand how our data is used, and not just collected, the Columbia researchers are hoping to bring more transparency to online ads. To do this, the researchers sent out emails containing keywords both benign—"travel"—and sensitive—"<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>." X-Ray then reported every ad that demonstrated a high degree of correlation to the topic in question in order to build a probabilistic framework that measures the relationship between the keywords and ads. Some of the results, which you can view on X-Rays website, were surprising. Emails and their correlated ads. Image: X-Ray For example, the researchers found a high degree of correlation between the keyword "debt" and ads for credit cards and car loans. This finding is especially concerning, since it suggests that the ad firms representing credit card companies are targeting people already in debt for new loans.  Bafflingly, the keyword "depression" returned ads for shamanic healing and a texting coach site to help you score the girl of your dreams with one perfectly crafted message. While humorous, its the ability to highlight exactly this kind of skewed, not quite 1:1, relationship between our data and the ads they engender that makes X-Ray such a notable tool. While some services, like the Electronic Frontier Foundations Privacy Badger, allow for some transparency regarding who is collecting data and how, X-Ray takes the next step to map how its used. The tool is part of a growing trend among techies to try and give consumers some skin in the game in the online data marketplace.  the keyword 'depression' returned ads for shamanic healing Telefonica, for example, is looking into a free market for data that will allow users to sell their information themselves to whomever they choose. Meanwhile, researchers at MIT have developed a data security framework called OpenPDS which allows users to keep their raw data in a black box of their own, before it gets into the hands of advertisers.  X-Ray is another link in the chain of consumer data empowerment, which seeks to explain what happens once users let their data go. The point is that I don't know how the hell my conversations end up serving me an ads—only that they do. I'm left to ask, "Why me? What did I do to be targeted by an ad for a massage therapist in my area?" While X-Ray doesn't have all the answers just yet—the researchers are keen to note that the service only maps correlation between keywords and ads, and not causation—it seems to be well on its way.

                                The internet is a big, black box when it comes to how our data is used by advertisers. Seeing a Gmail ad for something I just emailed a friend about doesn't much faze me anymore, yet I have pretty much no idea how my personal communications data got from the proverbial point A—as a keyword in an email—to its final form as a targeted ad.  X-Ray, an experimental tool that tracks how data turns into advertisements, aims to explain this relationship. Designed by researchers at Columbia University, X-Ray models the correlation between certain keywords, say, "debt," with the ads that return to the user, which might include something about car loans.  The vast bulk of the internet is funded by targeted ads, which use data mining to allow marketers to target us based on our recent searches, emails, and more. By trying to understand how our data is used, and not just collected, the Columbia researchers are hoping to bring more transparency to online ads. To do this, the researchers sent out emails containing keywords both benign—"travel"—and sensitive—"<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>." X-Ray then reported every ad that demonstrated a high degree of correlation to the topic in question in order to build a probabilistic framework that measures the relationship between the keywords and ads. Some of the results, which you can view on X-Rays website, were surprising. Emails and their correlated ads. Image: X-Ray For example, the researchers found a high degree of correlation between the keyword "debt" and ads for credit cards and car loans. This finding is especially concerning, since it suggests that the ad firms representing credit card companies are targeting people already in debt for new loans.  Bafflingly, the keyword "depression" returned ads for shamanic healing and a texting coach site to help you score the girl of your dreams with one perfectly crafted message. While humorous, its the ability to highlight exactly this kind of skewed, not quite 1:1, relationship between our data and the ads they engender that makes X-Ray such a notable tool. While some services, like the Electronic Frontier Foundations Privacy Badger, allow for some transparency regarding who is collecting data and how, X-Ray takes the next step to map how its used. The tool is part of a growing trend among techies to try and give consumers some skin in the game in the online data marketplace.  the keyword 'depression' returned ads for shamanic healing Telefonica, for example, is looking into a free market for data that will allow users to sell their information themselves to whomever they choose. Meanwhile, researchers at MIT have developed a data security framework called OpenPDS which allows users to keep their raw data in a black box of their own, before it gets into the hands of advertisers.  X-Ray is another link in the chain of consumer data empowerment, which seeks to explain what happens once users let their data go. The point is that I don't know how the hell my conversations end up serving me an ads—only that they do. I'm left to ask, "Why me? What did I do to be targeted by an ad for a massage therapist in my area?" While X-Ray doesn't have all the answers just yet—the researchers are keen to note that the service only maps correlation between keywords and ads, and not causation—it seems to be well on its way.

                                Was it the Illuminati?EPA A huge criminal investigation is underway in the Netherlands, following the downing of flight MH17. Ten Dutch prosecutors and 200 policemen are involved in collecting evidence to present at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The investigation may take time to find the real perpetrators, but that hasn’t stopped conspiracy theorists from speculating. Human beings are pattern-seeking creatures. We take the raw material from our senses, and shape it into descriptions, theories and predictions. The conspiracies that now surround MH17 and prior to that flight MH370 are an example of the same urge to order. In the case of MH370, which crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, the disappearance of an airliner with 239 people on board, begs for explanation, and so the theorists step in and start chattering on their blogs. The speculations around the destruction of MH17 have a slightly different character, perhaps because “the facts” seem to be clearer, and the key agents more obvious. After all, the grammar of any conspiracy theory about an event begins with the “who benefits” question. Searching for logic So who would have wanted the second Malaysia Airlines plane to be shot down? The Russians and the Ukrainian rebels don’t have much to gain from being portrayed as the murderers of 298 people. So if there wasn’t an advantage then they wouldn’t have done it, which is where the wheels of conspiracy logic then begin to grind. All the explanations then assume that the guilt of the Russians and their proxies is what “they” want us to believe, but that the truth is more complicated. The next obvious candidates are the Ukrainian government, attempting to swing international sympathy against the rebels and their supporters. Or, that the Ukrainians were actually trying to kill Vladimir Putin, whose official jet was flying back over Europe at the same time, and bore similar markings to MH17. Israel is invoked in many conspiracies of course, so there are suggestions that the jet was shot down in order to distract attention from the first day of the offensive in Gaza. Another account then focuses on the fact that there were delegates from a conference about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> on board, and hence that they were killed in order to prevent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> research from making progress. EPA The biggest swathe of conspiracies suggests that MH370 and MH17 are actually the same plane. The first plane, they claim, was hijacked and flown somewhere secret to be stored for a while. It was then rigged with explosives, flown over Donestsk and blown up in order to implicate one of the parties. A large amount of evidence about expired passports, parachutes seen descending from the plane, and photos of the damage on parts of the fuselage are all deployed in order to support suggestions as to who might be responsible – the American intelligence agency CIA, organised crime, the Illuminati and so on. Some of these accounts are offensive, or mad, or both. There are others who are busy claiming that the mad and offensive conspiracies are being disseminated by those who are trying to distract us from seeing “the truth”. Anyone who takes a position on a conspiracy is entangled within it, whether they like or not. And that includes this piece, of course. As Mel Gibson’s character Jerry Fletcher says in the 1997 movie Conspiracy Theory: A good conspiracy is unprovable. I mean, if you can prove it, it means they screwed up somewhere along the line. All conspiracy theorists are not mad Now Jerry Fletcher might sound crazy, but consider the alternatives. The first would be to say that there are no conspiracies. This is clearly mad, because we know that powerful forces do try to arrange the world for their benefit. The second gulf of Tonkin incident which justified US involvement in Vietnam was proven to be a fiction, and there is plenty of evidence about “false flag” and similar covert operations activities by everyone from the CIA to the British secret service MI6. Add to that the activities of global elites at Davos and the routine deceit practised by capitalist corporations and you would be naive to believe that the world is what it seems. The other alternative is less exciting. That would be to say that there are coincidences and mistakes, and that they can shape the world too. The fact that the two jets just happened to be from the same airline, or that an under-trained, trigger-happy separatist couldn’t recognise a passenger plane, are events which are disqualified within conspiracy thinking. Their assumption is that there is a logic to events, a pattern to the world, and that stuff doesn’t just happen. It is only in this sense that conspiracy theorists are mad, because most of their reasoning is perfectly sane. The problem is distinguishing the stupid accidents from the cunning plans, and that is something that none of us are terribly good at.

                                Throwing in the towel. Mark Probst, CC BY-SA Despite the many awareness-raising campaigns on the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a walk along any tourist beach will tell you just how many sun worshippers continue to soak up the sun excessively. And despite our use of all kinds of sunscreens, the statistics show a constant increase in the number of skin cancer cases. Why? Things that protect us against harmful rays from the sun include clothing such as hats and longer sleeves and sunglasses. But topical sun protection from sunscreens is ideal as it allows us to be more free. These products only appeared on the market in the 1930s and were promoted as tanning <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span>. The formulation of sunscreen products is complex and the first ones were especially flawed – because the UV-filters were used at low concentrations and their effectiveness was limited in UVB light range. Since then, the history of topical sun protection has been marked by milestones, or scandals as we could call them. Let’s not forget the Bergasol affair in the 1980s. Products were formulated with bergapten, a photo-sensitising molecule that is found in bergamot essential oil and other oils, but which had no place whatsoever in this type of product because mixed with light it can cause skin irritation. Today we have the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) to guide us. SPF is a universal indicator that testifies to the effectiveness of a product against UV (which includes UVA and UVB wavelengths), which can penetrate and damage the skin and cells. SPF is worked out by putting on a thick layer of a suncream on in the lab and working out the difference it makes based on a multiplier – so if unprotected skin took 15 minutes to burn, a sunscreen with an SPF of 10 would take 150 minutes, and SPF30 would take 450 minutes. This method of calculating protection is voted for overwhelmingly by manufacturers. Apart from the clear ethical shortcomings of this method (it does, after all involve irradiating volunteers for not insignificant periods or doses), we’ve discovered and revealed a certain number of potential biases. We’ve tested many products each year since 2000 and would say that about a third have much less protection than their SPF would suggest. Concerns have previously been raised about SPF performance out in the real world and a recent investigation by Which? consumer magazine found three suncreams – Piz Buin, Malibu and Hawaiian Tropic – had lower protection than the SPF30 on the bottle. Anti-inflammatories We’ve highlighted that a certain number of ingredients found in suncreams including allantoin (a molecule found in Symphytum officinale, a plant more commonly known as comfrey but which is now mostly synthetic), bisabolol (found in chamomile, also now mostly synthetic), and liquorice extracts, are likely to inhibit the appearance of redness due to their anti-inflammatory properties. As redness is a clinical sign that is used to determine SPF under current procedures, it can result in an overestimation of the SPF of products that contain these molecules. Using products high in anti-inflammatories can give a false sense of security – your DNA is still being damaged, you just don’t see or feel it happening. We have also demonstrated that the majority of filters approved in sunscreen products, including salicylates, benzophenones, PABA by-products, cinnamates and octocrylene, are highly anti-inflammatory. The problem is that despite this UV-filters are an essential ingredient for sunscreens to work. Our current work has been looking at how long these anti-inflammatory effects last and we’ve found that this can be several hours. It’s worth bearing in mind that any molecule that is likely to inhibit the development of the redness, regardless of what other action it has, will plays a part in overestimating SPF using current measures. Another major problem with topical sun protection comes from mineral products – titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide – whether or not they are organic. Despite some claims, high SPF factors in sunscreens (50, 50+) can’t be obtained with this type of sunscreen. Again the difference is due to an anti-flammatory effect and people who use these type of products for high SPF won’t be well protected. A better way to test? Instead, we think there should be a new standardised system of testing products based on chemical testing in the lab that only considers the optical properties of filters. This is the only way of quantifying the real effectiveness of sunscreen products. Sunscreen products are different from all others; they can actively protect against skin cancers. And crucially, we have trust in them so happily stay out in the sun longer, thinking they’re working as well as they claim. It would therefore be appropriate that they return to being classed as a medication, as they are in the US. The marketing of ineffective sunscreen products today will have to take a share of the responsibility in skin cancers – we can’t leave this heavy responsibility to the cosmetics industry.

                                Personal dispositions, feelings and beliefs may play a decisive role in explaining why people become radicalised.EPA/Stringer So far, the ongoing discussions about radicalisation of extremists both at home and abroad have tended to emphasise its sociological aspects. It has focused on concepts such as the religion and social environments of individuals. However, psychological accounts of extremist activity are infrequent, and it is often forgotten that only a few of those who hold strong ideological, political and religious views get involved in violent acts. Personal dispositions, feelings and beliefs may play a decisive role in explaining why people become radicalised. Nastiness, grudge and excuse Both conceptual analyses and empirical psychological studies that I have undertaken in the past have shown there are three main ingredients of militant extremist mindset. The first of these ingredients is nastiness, as captured by strong endorsement of statements approving of violent acts, such as “killing is justified when it is an act of revenge”, or “we should respond to terror with terror”. The second is grudge, which can take two forms. One is a direct reference to the “west”, shown in statements such as “terrorism in the form of unfair torture and execution without trial is carried out daily by many western countries” and “the west is degraded by its lack of dignified values, its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> epidemic, and its alcohol and drug addiction”. Grudge’s other manifestation is a more generalised belief in the vile world: “evil has been re-incarnated in the cult of markets and the rule of multinational companies”. The final ingredient is excuse. Although there are several forms of excuse, a common feature is justifications in people’s own minds of the nasty and violent things they tend to condone. In some cases it is with reference to God: “only one’s own God is the true God”. In other cases it is the trust in divine power: “at a critical moment, a divine power will step in to help our people”. These three components were identified within the general populations in several countries, including the US, Serbia and China. These aspects of militant extremist mindset are generic in nature and are not focused on Islamic terrorism. One does not need to become a terrorist if they endorse moderately all three ingredients of a militant extremist mindset. Even a strong endorsement of one or even two of the three components is unlikely to prompt a person to spring into action. However, high endorsement of all three components may lead a person to act. And if a group has high ratings on all three components, chances are that at least some members of the group may become potential recruits for a radical cause. Although the measure may be useful for identifying groups prone to terrorism, no justification can be made to use the militant extremist mindset for profiling purposes. What can be changed? Grudge should be more open to change than either nastiness or excuse. Nastiness is a social attitude akin to dogmatism and authoritarianism that are known to be hard to modify. Grudge is only partly a psychological internal state of the person and the other part – that is, the outside threat that causes unhappiness or fear – may be open to intervention. Education and media can play a crucial role. Policy response Governments can continue with campaigns to educate people of the benefits of immigration, equal opportunity for all citizens and the acceptance of diversity as well as the need for vigorous action to secure immigrants’ equal rights and promotion of the democratic process. Countering “protest counter-culture” can be achieved by directly engaging in discussions with counter-culture groups, monitoring their development and, eventually as a last resort, using police methods if the situation gets too heated. These efforts, perhaps, should be increased. Monitoring the level and changes in extremists' mindset In a recent interview, retiring ASIO chief David Irvine said that a small number of people who have very distorted views that propel them towards violence leading to mass casualties are a real concern. 150 Australians, included Khaled Sharrouf, are believed to be fighting in Iraq and Syria. Twitter Irvine added that the number of threats that ASIO is looking at, in terms of the numbers of people, has grown substantially with the Syrian conflict. Translated into the language of militant extremist mindset, this means that “grudge” among the people who already have an “excuse” has increased. Any policy response needs to account for the “nasty” ones within the protest counter-culture groups. Prudent governments should monitor the extent and the strength of the militant extremist mindset in its population and especially among the young, including older adolescents and students. If this had been done in the past, the warning signs would have been detectable ahead of the realisation that 150 Australians are engaged in terrorist activities in Syria and Iraq. Psychological research into radicalisation may complement political science and religious studies in countering terrorism in western society. Monitoring the strength of militant extremist mindset endorsements in different communities within the Australian population could be helpful. Finally, it may be useful to establish regular polling practices that would gauge the extent of radicalisation over time and in reaction to terrorist-related political acts at home and globally.

                                Will anyone jump on the Tesla patent bandwagon?raneko/Flickr, CC BY With the much-anticipated arrival next month of electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla’s Model S to Australian shores, it’s a good time to revisit Tesla’s pledge to freely share patents. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>, co-founder and CEO of Tesla Motors, wrote a statement on the company’s blog entitled All Our Patent Are Belong To You back in June. In a short announcement giving some context to the company’s decision, Musk claims that the electric vehicle industry as a whole would benefit from an “open source” approach towards innovation. His pledge to the market that “Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology” spawned headlines around the world, and purportedly armed those who are opponents of the patent system. Commentators such as Eric Lane and Rajiv Rao were quick to suggest that Tesla is abandoning their patents and making them freely available – but the reality is quite the opposite. There are ‘known unknowns’ <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> at the reopening of the former NUMMI plant, now Tesla Motors. Steve Jurvetson/Flickr, CC BY Musk has since been reported as saying the new policy is not an abandonment in favour of some notion of the public domain. In fact, by allowing others to use its patented technologies, Tesla is suggesting that other electric vehicle manufacturing companies would also benefit from adopting this approach in the quest of developing a common technology platform, known as a cross license. With cross licensing, manufacturers are essentially prevented from filing patent infringement lawsuits against each other and recently corporations have recognised those benefits. Some of the world’s biggest information technology companies, including Google and Canon, last month banded together to form the License on Transfer (LOT) network, which describes itself as “a new kind of royalty-free cross-license”. Tesla’s caveat “in good faith” also calls into question whether the patent pledge is a genuine gesture of goodwill. But this does not amount to Tesla “taking down the patent wall”, but rather an attempt to control the direction of the industry. Tesla’s announcement is not entirely without precedent. Swedish carmaker Volvo patented the design for the V-type three-point safety belt in 1959 and made it freely available. The new safety belt soon afterwards became the industry standard for vehicles worldwide. Sean Dreilinger, CC BY-NC-SA There is further evidence of the use of this strategy in the past by companies such as IBM and Google in the information and communications technology sector, where such pledges have been used to ensure industry-wide adoption of interoperability standards. Long live the patent system Patents provide the owner (or patentee) exclusive rights to make, use or sell an invention covered by those rights for a limited period of time. Despite Tesla’s decision to make its old patents available, it does not stop the company from seeking patents for its newer technologies. Keeping in mind that Musk was able to secure venture capital funding on the basis of securing patented technologies in the first place, it now seems that he can shift the strategic focus of those commercial assets towards building goodwill in the marketplace. Musk on The Colbert Report: ‘We kind of want the car to be your friend.’ George Mason University law professor Adam Mossoff points out: “Tesla’s new policy is an example of Musk exercising patent rights, not abandoning them.” The real value We are yet to hear whether other manufacturers have taken up Tesla’s offer. But what we do know is Tesla will only continue to prosper if the entire industry succeeds. In other words, it needs commercial partners to improve battery technologies, build charging stations and band together to change public perception. The latest move by Tesla and its partner, Panasonic, will see the construction of the new Gigafactory, which will produce long range battery packs for Tesla’s electric vehicles. In the end, the impact of Tesla’s announcement may depend on to what extent other players in the industry are willing to invest in manufacturing vehicles using Tesla’s patented (and patent-pending) technologies.

                                The blurring of the line between the military and the police, especially in the US, is now on the political agenda following recent events in Ferguson, Missouri.EPA/Roberto Rodriguez Anyone watching the footage coming out of Ferguson, Missouri in recent days would be forgiven for thinking they had tuned into a scene from a combat zone, rather than suburban America. There has been a public outcry over the heavily militarised response of local law enforcement to protests following the police shooting of a young black man, Michael Brown. But is this just a one off, or are police becoming more militarised in their responses to mass public protest? The nature of policing Policing is an occupation different from any other. It is one of the few civilian occupations where you are able to possess a firearm and other lethal weapons and are authorised to use deadly force in certain justifiable situations. Police are paramilitary in that they rely on rank structure for command and control; their members wear the same uniform; they have access to substantial weaponry and are all working towards a common purpose. Police services have a strong organisational culture and to some degree are isolated from mainstream society, often socialising within the policing subculture. American criminologist Peter Kraska describes police militarisation as the process whereby civilian police increasingly draw from, and model themselves around, the doctrines of militarism and the military model. He highlights four particular areas where police provide tangible evidence of this: material, organisational, cultural and operational indicators. The US and decentralised policing Part of the problem in the US is that many police services are small municipal departments that lack both resources and professionalism. This is a by-product of having a highly decentralised law enforcement environment. The Ferguson Police Department, for instance, consists of 72 personnel including 54 commissioned officers and 18 civilian support staff. The UK recognised this problem and has recently undertaken steps to centralise policing services. In Australia there are highly centralised large policing services in each state. Centralisation provides the operational benefits of homogeneous command and control, capacity for resources and increased professionalisation. One of the criticisms in Ferguson is that at one stage there were four different police services present at the protest – the Ferguson police, the St Louis County police (where Ferguson is located), police from the City of St Louis and police from the Missouri Highway Patrol. The rise of the ‘warrior cop’ The blurring of the line between the military and the police, especially in the US, is now on the political agenda. Walter Olson, of libertarian American thinktank the Cato Institute, criticised the rising militarisation of law enforcement as illustrated in Ferguson: Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? Olson was not alone in his criticism of the heavy-handed response of law enforcement in Ferguson. Republican senator Rand Paul used the Ferguson case to argue for a reversal of the current US trend of supplying military hardware for law enforcement purposes. Author Radley Balko has catalogued the rise of the warrior cop and the increasing convergence of military and policing operational doctrines. He illustrates how SWAT teams (heavily armed special weapons teams) have proliferated from the mid-1970s in the US: The country’s first official SWAT team started in the late 1960s in Los Angeles. By 1975, there were approximately 500 such units. Today, there are thousands. SWAT teams deployed in police raids in the US increased from 3000 per year in the 1980s to approximately 45,000 by 2007. Police in Ferguson have used tear gas to quell protesters. EPA/Robert Cohen All Australian police services have a SWAT team-equivalent, but their deployment is more judicious. For instance, the Victorian Special Operations Group (SOG) requires the permission of an Assistant Commissioner to deploy. The Queensland Special Emergency and Response Team can only be deployed to pre-planned operations that are high-risk situations by a deputy commissioner or delegate. In 2011, the Victorian SOG completed 349 operations. They dealt with four sieges, affected tactical entry into ten buildings, conducted 54 high-risk arrests and target intercepts and 36 contain-and-call operations. None resulted in fatalities. In some cases in Australia, the use of these specialist groups has actually declined. In 2013, the New South Wales ombudsman raised concerns that the call-out of the State Protection Group had actually fallen by 50% over the previous six years. Military hardware for police purposes Military assets and technology have also been brought within the policing sphere. In Queensland, police are currently using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s to provide “situational awareness”. The Queensland Police Service (QPS) has flagged the use of military-style <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s used in Afghanistan for deployment during the G20 summit. Many Australian police services use other military hardware. Western Australian Police, for example, use the Bearcat armoured vehicle. Queensland police also recently purchased Remington R4s, a military assault rifle, for use by general duty officers. Engagement and accountability The images from Ferguson are cause for concern. Armed snipers are scoping the protesters. And yet, a line of officers in riot gear also stand in plain view in front of the protesters. Victoria Police was criticised for its response to Occupy Melbourne protests. AAP/Julian Smith These images are contradictory. If there was any threat of an armed person in the crowd, officers would not be standing in plain view. Conversely, if there was no intelligence as to armed persons in the crowd, then there is no justification for armed snipers to be poised. In Australia, the reaction of various police services to Occupy protests was vividly different. Victoria Police used extreme force to remove protesters with subsequent complaints against police. Yet when faced with similar Occupy protests in Western Australia, police used a more successful community engagement approach. The use of force by any police service needs to be accountable. Some police services are taking progressive steps by utilising technology – such as body cameras – that will actually increase public confidence in police actions. One Californian police service has attributed a 60% decrease in use of force and an 88% reduction in complaints to the implementation of body cameras. The police service involved was similar in size to Ferguson Police Department, but the lessons learnt could not be more different.

                                This is carnal science fiction cinema.Sancho McCann/Flickr I will often say to my film students that if you want to know what aches a culture at a particular historical juncture then you need to visit and spend time with the catastrophic imagination of science fiction. For it is in the restless dreaming of future horizons where the hopes and fears of the present are laid bare. Showing at the Melbourne International Film Festival in a lush restored 35mm print and with its original montage ending restored, Phase IV - the only film to be directed by the exquisite poster and title sequence designer, Saul Bass - explores what happens when humankind is threatened by hyper-intelligent ants intent on colonising Earth. Trailer for Phase IV (1974). Set in the Arizona desert – but filmed at Pinewood Studios in England and on-location in Kenya – Phase IV narrates the struggle between two scientists, James Lesko (Michael Murphy) and Ernest Hubbs (Nigel Davenport) as they seek to understand and overcome the mysterious unification of all ant colonies and the (alien) hive mind that controls and advances their collective cause. It is suggested that if Lesko and Hubbs cannot stop these super ants, then human civilisation is doomed. Doomed, I tell you. Doomsday visions Visually and aurally the film is indebted to a heady mixture of influences including the wildlife documentary; the anti-realism of European art cinema; the topography of the desert Western and the rural road movie; and to the new wave of electronic music and atonal chords that is so effectively used to eerily score the film and its often ferocious feral sound effects. The ants enunciate like a ravenous and telepathic army on the relentless march to herald in the Armageddon, while the bleeps, squeaks, hums and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> that also saturate the soundscape creates the impression that invisible forces haunt every space. These are not ants that can be trampled upon or squished between ones fingers but super centurions of the insect world. The film’s cinematography is composed of two distinct styles. Firstly, there are the intimate and naturalistic close ups of the ants, their colonies, machinery, computers, the sun and the moon, obelisques, and the various textures - such as skin, electrical wires, yellow poison - that colour and wash the entire mise-en-scène. One feels as if one is in the laboratory or desert with the ants, and in that transferable relationship between film and viewer, as one watches one scratches skin and hair as if their phantom legs are beginning to crawl over and burrow down deep into you. This is carnal science fiction cinema. The wildlife photographer Ken Middleham shot the insect sequences for Phase IV, as he also did for the documentary The Hellstrom Chronicle. Through a microscopic lens, the anatomy of an ant has never been so diabolically well chronicled. Phase IV is also composed of long shots, frames of deep focus and wide panoramas, so that the shimmering heat of the desert and the liquid fire of the sun appear enormous and awesome in their power. The film is full of sublime cinematography. It simply takes one’s breath away and makes one feel like a tiny dot, like a single ant, in a giant universe. This oscillation between near and far, between claustrophobia and agoraphobia, positions Earth in a never ending and expanding cosmos, but also under a forensic microscope where all our activities are being closely monitored. Ultimately this is a film caught in a paranoid state of delusion and allusion, as the troubles of America seep its way into its metaphoric visual and aural palettes. Signs of the times Narratively, Phase IV speaks to a number of critical concerns of America at the time the film was made: ecological and environmental collapse; the Cold War, and the Vietnam war; the ambivalent relationship that society has to science and their hyper-rationalist scientists; and to the irrational fear of miscegenation. Velvet ant stinger tip scanning electron microscope Janice Carr/Wikimedia, CC BY Phase I: Ecological and Environmental Apocalypse One of the concerns of Phase IV is the relentless expansion of the suburbs, population growth, unsustainability and the mechanisation of farming. The film’s first land-based shots are of new town billboards and half completed homes. The yellow poison used to destroy the ant colony is a coda for industrial fertilisation and the dangers it brings to agriculture. The ants, which wipe out species that are above them in the food chain, are the avatars that put the ecology of Earth out of balance and as a consequence threaten the survival of all species, of the planet itself. However, we realise late in the film that they are actually custodians of the future – it is we who must be stopped or over-taken in the evolutionary chain if Earth is to prosper. Phase II: Red Ants under the Bed Phase IV was made at a time when the Cold War and Vietnam was uppermost in the American nation’s psyche. The ants in the film become both the fifth column, and the personification of Soviet norms – working collectively for the greater good and without individuality or individualism, always willing to sacrifice so long as the cohering centre is maintained. The ant army can also be likened to the Viet Cong or the National Liberation Front, fighting against the superior technology and firepower of the American military. The ants build a series of connecting tunnels and traps, infiltrate the compound, and in consort with the “natural” environment turn the desert and sun on the scientists. The scientists, secured in their hi-tech fortress compound, use yellow poison (agent orange, napalm) to kill the ants, but the ants only grow stronger. Eventually, the scientists have to abandon their laboratory and the ants begin to secure their victory as their centurions march on its grounds. Phase III: Mad Science Phase IV offers up an ambivalent representation of science. Hubbs is the archetypal mad scientist, one who seeks truth in rational method and through reason alone, but is solely intent on destroying the ants at whatever cost. He uses science in a destructive way and is impervious to the human death that occurs around him. The film is a warning about letting too much science into the world. Ant. Sancho McCann/Flickr, CC BY By contrast, Lesko is the humanist scientist. Through his mathematical formulations he seeks to communicate with the ants, to understand them better. Lesko cares about human and ant life and looks to reason and emotion to bridge the species gap. However, the film suggests that Hubb’s approach maybe the one that needs to be followed, offering the viewer a powerful Cold War message about weapons proliferation and the need for aggressive responses. Phase IV: Inter-Species coupling Phase IV has a fear of borders being breached and is full of images of thresholds being overtaken, overrun. The film offers us images of “white flight” in which the ants become marauding rioters intent on taking over the “neighbourhood”. There is one scene of a house being “looted”, flames licking its grounds. The film’s context can be set in the context of the race riots and civil rights abuses that dominated the period. Nonetheless, Phase IV brings the two species together, ant and human, suggesting that in their communion a new dawn will be reached, a new age will be born. In the newly restored cut of the film, this future horizon is a psychedelic trip where a new inter-species reaches the astral plane.

                                Zmapp drugs arriving in Liberia.Ahmed Jallanzo/EPA The news that at least 20 patients suspected to have <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> had fled a clinic in Monrovia, Liberia, after a recent protest shows just how volatile trust can be between local populations and medical staff and officials trying to contain the virus. Any debate over experimental drug use in West Africa is as much tied to this issue as it is to whether deploying them will do anything to stem the outbreak. Some echoes with early <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> pandemic Since it was discovered 40 years ago, research into <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus has led to several experimental drug therapies that could be used to treat infection or as a vaccine. It’s not clear whether the Zmapp drug given to two US doctors and a priest infected with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> affected the outcome of infection (both doctors survived, the priest died) but with unsuccessful efforts to bring its spread under control and more than a thousand people already known to have died in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and a smaller group in Nigeria, the pressure to deploy them is huge. Drugs and vaccines are termed experimental for a reason – they have not gone through the normal rigorous testing that is required before a new drug is licensed for use in humans. There’s no objective proof that they are effective, and they may even be harmful, but in extreme situations their deployment may be perfectly justified. Using drugs in extraordinary circumstances in this way isn’t new – it happened with antiretroviral drugs during the early years of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> global pandemic. When <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> first appeared, it had 100% fatality rate. However, the fatality rate of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is lower (around 60%) and in the case of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, the drugs had been through significant clinical testing – they were just made available more rapidly than usual. With <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, the drugs and treatments being proffered have had only limited testing or no testing in humans at all. Experimental environment This raises many difficult ethical, scientific and societal questions. While clinical trials are designed to carefully manage risk and include controls, using experimental drugs against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> won’t have the same luxury. With dangerous viruses such as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, there is also the significant matter of how, practically, to achieve the same efficacy that full licensing of a drug would require in trials. People cannot be deliberately given <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in order to try out a drug or vaccine, and we will never know in advance where or when the next outbreak will occur that would create a natural environment for a trial. Perhaps the best hope is that an experimental treatment shows sufficient promise when deployed in the current outbreak to warrant a government or international organisation funding its small-scale manufacture and stockpiling for use next time <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> appears. Managing expectations Any measures to restrict the spread of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus need good health infrastructure, trained staff and a system that can deliver a unified response across affected areas if they are to work. Isolating patients, contact follow-ups, breaking the chain of transmission and quarantine, have little to do with science or medicine and far more to do with practicalities on the ground. Deploying experimental medicine happens within this context, and it carries specific risks that go beyond efficacy. Communicating what is happening and why to individuals and whole communities is vital. The World Health Organisation has already attempted to manage expectations after a recent decision that it was ethical to extend the use of experimental drugs for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>: Recent intense media coverage of experimental medicines and vaccines is creating some unrealistic expectations, especially in an emotional climate of intense fear … The public needs to understand that these medical products are under investigation. They have not yet been tested in humans and are not approved by regulatory authorities, beyond use for compassionate care … For most, administration is difficult and demanding. Safe administration of some requires facilities for intensive care, which are rare in West Africa. Adverse reactions to treatments can’t be predicted but they regularly happen. And the potential consequences of adverse reactions and/or failure of the drugs to assist may have additional consequences. As well as potential physical damage to patients, a vital but tenuous faith in the medical staff working to control the outbreak could be undermined in West Africa. The protest in Monrovia shows just how precarious trust is. It might also be undermined if treated patients don’t appear to benefit, even if they are not adversely affected, increasing people’s reluctance to bring infected friends and relatives to medical centres for treatment. The expected outcomes from using experimental drugs will need to be carefully managed. The number of available doses is very small so however they are deployed, they wouldn’t do much to contain the outbreak. In terms of evidence of efficacy, it also raises the question about whether the number of treatments could ever be sufficient to make any acceptable estimate of how well a drug has worked. When it comes to any potential vaccines, very limited doses raises the question of how recipients would be chosen, since vaccines have to be given to people who aren’t yet ill. Perhaps the greatest impact on the course of the outbreak would come from protecting those tasked with caring the infected but of course, with many overseas medical staff, this might invite criticism that they were being treated more favourably. Alongside all this it’s important to carry on with more traditional clinical trials. Criticism of big pharma for not producing an effective remedy for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> over the past 40 years has been overly simplistic. Taking a new drug or vaccine to market may cost up to US$1 billion. It’s not simply a matter of there being insufficient profit in developing drugs to treat <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> – there would actually be a huge loss. But given this is the longest and largest outbreak yet recorded, let’s hope there is new impetus to push forward in this area.

Even so, these animals play a crucial role in our ecosystem — and now they are in danger of disappearing. According to Wired, 6.5 million Little Brown Bats lived in the eastern U.S. in 2006, making them the most populous wild mammal species in America at the time. Since then, millions of Little Brown Bats have died, leaving them a "threatened species" in many states. What is killing the bats? Though bat death has often been linked to pesticides and other chemicals, the chief cause seems to be White Nose Syndrome (WNS), a fatal fungal infection with no treatment or cure. The fungus, which kills bats in hibernation during wintertime, has been quickly spreading throughout the eastern United States. Image Credit: U.S. Read More

                                It can be used to store energy. At the American Chemical Society's national meeting this week, researchers from the University of Alberta unveiled a way to create extremely efficient batteries called "<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=supercapacitor">supercapacitor</a></span>s" using specially treated hemp, a non-psychoactive variation of the marijuana plant. That means hemp could be a low-cost, renewable raw material that revolutionizes energy storage. How it works: Hemp fibers are heated over the course of 24 hours, causing the material's carbon atoms to align and form nanosheets, each of which are only one carbon atom thick, and which can be used as conductors in batteries. Basic structure of a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=supercapacitor">supercapacitor</a></span>.

Millions of gallons of a cocktail of water, sand and chemicals are injected into the horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale, releasing the gas—and causing violent protests in Europe and parts of America.Geothermal energy, by contrast, has yet to stir much controversy. Most geothermal plants are located where water has seeped down into the Earth’s crust, been heated and forced back up through permeable rock. Drill a well to between 3,000 and 12,000 feet, and the searing water and steam can be released to drive generators.Geothermal is a minnow among power sources. America has the world’s highest installed capacity of geothermal generating plants—3.4 gigawatts’ worth at last count (see first chart)—but they generate only 0.4% of its electricity (see second chart). New “enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS), however, look set to...

                                Rice University researchers have developed a new ultralight but tough nanofoam called “GO-0.5BN” from atom-thick sheets. The finding is an update to a previous computer-simulation study of “pillared boron nitride (PBN)” reported in July by KurzweilAI. The Rice team has now actually produced and tested the material.

                                AT FIRST glance it would appear that China has gone online, and gone digital, with great gusto.

That is the conclusion of a report published on July 24th by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), a think-tank run by the eponymous consulting firm.
