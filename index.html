							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								Sanctions work. Russia’s problems may be manifold and closely related to the precipitous decline in the price of oil, but sanctions have played an important part in bringing Russia to its economic knees, too. For those commentators who were urging Barack Obama to initiate a more dramatic, military response to Russia’s recent revanchism, this episode should provide a salutary reminder about the benefits of patience and perspicacity. There is, of course, absolutely no guarantee that things will end well despite the apparent efficacy of an economic rather than a military response to Vladimir Putin’s geopolitical ambitions. His domestic popularity has largely been based on restoring Russian greatness, standing up to the west, and a number of other improbable claims that went over well when living standards were rising. Now, however, the basis for the Russian revival looks as unsustainable as the resource boom that fuelled it. [As we know only too well in Australia, any country that hitches its collective fate to the price of volatile mineral and energy prices is asking for trouble, especially when little effort is made to diversify economically and invest for the future. What makes Russia’s predicament especially acute, however, are the geopolitical implications of largely unanticipated developments like the American <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> revolution. Putin and the oligarchs he has helped to enrich may have been forgiven for not foreseeing the transformation of global energy markets, perhaps, but they should have been more alert to the possible impact of sanctions. The reality is that Russia, like just about every other state bar North Korea, is highly dependent on, and locked-into, complex economic regimes over which they can exercise very little influence. Russia needs the price of oil to be over $US100 to break even. Not only is it currently approaching half of that, but it is taking the rouble down with it. For Russian banks with loans that need to be serviced in foreign currencies, this is a nightmarish prospect. The Russian central banks decision to dramatically jack up interest rates in the middle of the night did nothing to help the rouble and reinforced the impression of panic and desperation as the authorities try to keep control. No doubt Putin will blame the ‘the west’ for his misfortunes. To some extent he’s not wrong. ‘Smart’ sanctions that have targeted Putin cronies have been painful, and the bill that Congress recently passed will increase the pressure on Russia’s already weakened economy – and on the long-suffering Russian masses. Unfortunate as this may be, it is rather the point. The hope is that Putin’s popularity will rapidly erode as the reality of sanction-induced economic pain takes hold amongst the general population. There are plenty of signs that the economy is tanking, but not necessarily inducing a similar haemorrhaging of support for Putin – thus far. If and when Putin’s popularity does collapse, the big question will be how he – and his coterie of supporters – respond to an unprecedented economic and political crisis. After all, Putin has been very lucky thus far and his presidencies have coincided with a long-term and seemingly inexorable increase in resource and energy prices. It is not inconceivable that elite level support for Putin could crumble, too. Authoritarian, patronage-based regimes are difficult to sustain when there is less plunder to go round and key cronies are feeling the pain. Putin’s recent state of the nation address did little to reassure his increasingly nervous supporters and was greeted with only polite applause. Putin clearly had a knack of responding to, and benefiting from, the sense of humiliation that has gripped so many in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. But it is far from clear that either he or his supporters have the skills or the vision to cope with an immediate economic crisis and a possibly permanent transformation in the value of Russia’s principal resource and energy exports. The great worry is that facing a possibly direct threat to his personal survival, Putin may seek to play the oldest card available to leaders in a jam – especially autocratic ones with fading personality cults. Blame some convenient foe or other and distract the masses with an external conflict. There is, of course, one readily to hand in Ukraine. The problem with sanctions is that while they may work, there is no predicting their impact. South Africa and Iran suggest they can be the best way of peacefully changing behaviour. North Korea reminds us there are limits to this process. We must hope Putin’s calculations really do include the fate of the wider Russian population, and not just himself and his cronies. Perhaps the plutocrats will find a more pliable autocrat to oversee Russia’s tottering ship of state.

								Students working behind the scenes. Legal via FikMik/Shutterstock It isn’t until Episode 7 of the certified podcast sensation Serial, that listeners learn about the show’s silent partner. Quietly, and with little fuss, the University of Virginia Innocence Project has been looking again at the case of Adnan Syed since March 2014. Serial’s presenter Sarah Koenig has taken listeners on a journey as she explores whether Adnan could have been wrongly convicted of the murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee. Adnan and Hae were both 17-year-old high school students in Baltimore County when she was strangled on January, 13, 1999. Adnan was sentenced to 30 years in prison, largely due to the evidence of his friend Jay. Adnan has always denied his involvement in Hae’s murder. Led by Professor Deirdre Enright, the UVA Innocence Project is a pro bono clinic where second year law students investigate wrongful convictions. Koenig had initially called Enright to ask her about a similar case. During their conversation Enright mentioned that her student had asked: “are you going to find us another good case?”. The good case was, of course, staring right at her. Serial’s presenter Sarah Koenig. Meredith Heuer The UVA Innocence Project is now asking a court to test a physical evidence recovery kit that was used at the time of the murder, but never tested for DNA. Innocence Projects in the US began in the 1980s. But they really took off in the 1990s, due to the advent of new DNA testing methods. The Innocence Network, an affiliation of pro bono organisations and law school clinics, has 56 US members. They have helped to exonerate more than 300 people through DNA evidence. Of these, 33 were under 18 when they were convicted, 28 pleaded guilty to crimes they did not commit and 18 were on death row. Innocence Projects in the UK In 2005, Michael Naughton founded the first UK university-based Innocence Project at the University of Bristol. There are now 27 Innocence Projects in existence in the country. Some – like the University of Leeds Justice Project – use a different moniker. Many were originally linked to the Innocence Network UK, which appeared to have a somewhat fraught relationship with its former partners. It is estimated that there are more than 600 students working on at least 70 cases in the UK thought to involve wrongful conviction. In December 2014, we finally saw the first ever successful appeal – courtesy of staff and students at Cardiff Law School Innocence Project. Brian Leveson and two other judges quashed Dwaine George’s conviction for murder, saying it was no longer safe. In 2011, George was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting of 18-year-old Daniel Dale. Gunshot residue found on George’s coat formed the basis of the prosecution’s case against him. His appeal was based on new scientific evidence relating to that residue. Leveson paid tribute to the work of the team at Cardiff Law School, who had worked on the case for nine years. Publicity boost Episode 7 of Serial allowed listeners to enter the world of Innocence Projects. You can hear the sound of a law clinic getting ready to consider a new case, says Koenig at one point, as we listen to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> of a scanner and muffled, excited chatter. It’s rare for anyone to be interested in the day-to-day running of these projects, despite the hard labour that they put in. Enright herself has said that the attention they have received has been unexpected, overwhelming and startling. Professor Julie Price, head of the Pro Bono Unit at Cardiff Law School, has written candidly about the pressures, crossroads and brick walls that projects such as these face. The Criminal Cases Review Commission receives more than 1,500 applications each year. Even if an application gets through the first sift, it can take up to 41 weeks for a case to be allocated to a Case Review Manager. Only 4% are ever referred to the appeals court. Imagine you’re trying to deal with that – while maintaining the goodwill of lawyers whose free support can be crucial, and providing close and supportive supervision to law students. The danger is that once Serial has ended and the newspapers have moved on to another story, we will forget about the law students and supervisors who toil away behind the scenes for little recognition and no financial reward. To do so would be a crime.

								Making waves but will it cross the pond? Maurizio Gambarini The latest report from Public Health England revealed that there were more than 100,000 people living with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> in the UK, with 6,000 new infections last year. Around a quarter of people are unaware they carry the virus and risk passing it to others. According to the figures, the past year has also seen a rise in the number of men who acquired <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> through sex with other men. With no cure or vaccine against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, these figures clearly highlight the need for new strategies to control transmission. After nearly three decades of anti-viral therapies aimed at treating people after they have been infected, a new preventative measure has been making waves: Truvada. Truvada has been used in the treatment of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> for more than a decade, alone or in combination with other anti-viral drugs. But it can also be used as a prophylaxys or PrEP drug – anti-viral that can be taken before exposure to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> to prime the body against the invader and reduce the risk of infection. It combines two different drugs – tenofovir and emtricitabine – which prevent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> cells from multiplying. The original three-year iPrEX study into the efficacy of Truvada in 2010 showed that a daily oral dose of the drug gave 44% additional protection from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> among the 2,499 men or transgender women who have sex with men (MSM) followed from 2007 to 2007. Overall, this corresponded to a 92% reduction in the risk of acquiring <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. The study is now being continued on a broader scale to measure the impact of Truvada in the long term. Even safer sex? Men by Shutterstock What is clear from these studies is that the drug alone does not completely prevent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-1 infection, nor does it cure the virus. In combination with safer sex practice, however, it can significantly reduce the impact of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection. Unexpected side effect Since 2012 the US Food and Drug Administration has approved and licenced Truvada as a preventative measure for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. While there is no question that Truvada is efficient in preventing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection and is a great hope for fighting its spread, there have also been some unexpected results with using this kind of treatment. These centre mainly around sexual behaviour and adherence – particularly that it may actually cause some to give up more traditional prevention strategies like condom use. Some people may do this, and it may seem plausible that such preventative treatment could encourage unsafe sex practice because participants feel protected – but the original study did consider this. Instead, it found evidence of a decrease in high-risk behaviour within the participants’ cohort. One hypothesis raised by the authors was that the daily ingestion of a pill may act as a reminder of the potential risk, thereby promoting behavioural change towards safer practice. Strict daily dose Another key issue here is the strict adherence to the treatment regime – something that has also cropped up in stories about Truvada: that some have taken it as a one-off preventative pill ahead of sex. There is a Canadian trial looking at whether Truvada can be taken on an intermittent basis but there is currently little information about the efficacy of Truvada in those who fail to follow this daily requirement. The iPrEX study relied on participants swallowing the pills every day. Clearly, if the pill is taken occasionally ahead of unprotected sex then it is likely to only be very moderately efficient. The study showed that participants who engaged with daily administration only 50% of the time, had a 50% reduction in the efficacy of protection. While Truvada is part of post-infection treatment regimen in the UK, it is not currently used as a preventative treatment. To deepen our understanding of these issues in the UK, the Medical Research Council is sponsoring a study to investigate the effect of prophylaxis treatment in the population of men who have sex with men, but also the potential changes in sexual behaviour and adherence to the treatment. Adverse effects Several factors commonly associated with most <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> antiviral therapies also have to be taken into account. A common side effect reported is frequent nausea over several weeks. More adverse effects such as production of lactic acid in the blood and liver problems have also been reported. Patients with hepatitis B infection can also encounter worsening of their symptoms. We also know very little about the emergence of resistance against Truvada which might impair its wider use in the population. In addition to all of this is the question of cost. The cost of the pill in the US is estimated to range from US$8,000 to US$12,000 per year, which corresponds to a continuous daily supply. NICE puts the price for the drug at £418.50 per 30-tablet pack, which means if used as a PrEP treatment it could cost up to £5,092 per year. To have an impact, this treatment need to go further than just giving a drug to a small fraction of the population, otherwise it is unlikely to have a broader impact on transmission. So it may block the spread of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> in groups like men who have sex with men, but there would be no effect on transmission in the heterosexual population, lessening its overall impact. But could more blanket cover prove too expensive? Despite a reduction in the number of late diagnoses of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, which has led to better more efficient treatment earlier on, there is little evidence that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission is diminishing in the MSM population. Drugs such as Truvada and other PrEP drugs could prove a game changer in our approach to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, but given the cost and the reports about adherence the new study into these issues in the UK is to be welcomed.

								<span class="enum">2.</span>From disgust to deceit – a shorter path than you might think
							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								Our reaction to disgusting things may be evolutionarily-derived. Flickr/Rainja, CC BY-NC-ND Feeling queasy? How about deceitful? New research shows feelings of disgust encourage unethical, self-interested behaviours such as lying to get more money. At first look, these findings would suggest that feelings of disgust are to be avoided (such as dealing with that mouldy food container in the work fridge before the holiday break). On deeper reflection, though, the takeaway message isn’t one of “emotions are bad” but instead is one of the significance of our emotional system for helping us navigate our worlds – physical and social – in adaptive ways. The devil is in the detail The new research, published in Organisational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, shows that making people feel disgusted led to increases in deceitful behaviour that would benefit the self. In their first experiment, participants rated consumer products that are known to elicit a disgust response – such as diapers and diarrhoea medicine – or neutral consumer products – such as vitamins and pens. Next up, they were tasked to flip a coin. Heads, the participants could earn US$2. Tails, no promise of money. Some participants were told the reverse. The coin flip was committed alone and participants were later asked to report the result. This presented a dilemma of sorts: the participants could lie, get the US$2 and never be found out. Would I lie to you? In the results, 63% of the disgusted and 52% of the control participants reported a favourable coin flip. Remembering that odds are 50% for a favourable outcome, it’s clear that disgusted participants were engaging in higher levels of deception. In another experiment, participants were asked to describe either their most disgusting experience or a typical uneventful evening. Those who described their most disgusting experience were nearly twice as likely as the others to lie about solving anagrams in order to obtain more credit for completing a survey. How did the researchers know participants were lying? One of the anagrams was impossible to solve. In yet another experiment, participants either watched the “worst toilet in Scotland” scene from the movie Trainspotting (below) or a clip from a coral reefs documentary. CONTENT WARNING: This video is highly disgust-inducing and contains strong language. Watch at your discretion. Next, participants were given the opportunity to send an honest message that would result in them getting US$2 and their partner getting US$3 or a dishonest message that would result in them getting US$3 and their partner getting US$2. Deception was 32% more likely in the disgust condition. Further, this deceit meant that their partner received less (US$2 instead of US$3), thus showing that disgust-induced self-interest can even occur at the cost of others. This effect was replicated in their final experiment. All is not lost Their final experiment included a critical extra condition aimed at finding out how to erase the effect. If we can make participants act more deceitful by inducing disgust, so the researchers reasoned, can we do something to interrupt the process? In this study, they added a stage in between the disgust induction and the deceit measure. It was a subtle one – reminiscent of the first experiment. They asked participants to rate cleaning products or neutral products. Thinking about cleaning products erased the effect of watching the Trainspotting video on deception. Taken together, these experiments suggest that we should likely try to avoid feeling disgust. Without disgust, there would be no disgust-driven deceit. I would suggest, though, that this conclusion misses the mark. The key to this lies (no pun intended) in understanding one theoretical approach to understanding the role of our emotions in shaping thought and action: functionalism. All for the greater good Many emotion researchers, including myself, work from a functionalist perspective on emotion. Functionalist logic stipulates that our emotion system exists because it <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span> us in adapting our behaviour, thoughts, and attention to our environments. This logic is based in evolutionary theory: emotions were selected for during evolution because they help facilitate survival and thriving. Disgust, in fact, is a prime example of an emotion that has adaptive functions. When we come across a pile of vomit, that mouldy food container or other potentially toxic substances, we have a near-reflexive disgust reaction. Don’t eat the mouldy fruit. Flickr/Casey Bisson, CC BY-NC-SA We scrunch our noses, turn our heads or, if we are in the unfortunate situation of having put a noxious substance in our mouth, promptly gag and spit it out (sour milk, anyone?). We also feel a compulsion to wash or cleanse ourselves. This reaction serves the purpose, or function, of protecting ourselves from potential harm. Karen Winterich and colleagues argue in the latest research that it is this same self-protection function that drives the increase in self-interested deception in their experiments. In essence, just as the disgust expression and desire to cleanse serve to protect the physical self, the deceit observed in participants serve to protect the “economic self”. In fact, they found evidence of this – the degree to which disgust led to deception was explained by an increase in self-protection motives. A cleansing experience This functionalist approach is also useful for understanding why thinking about clean products erased the effect – the disgust-prompted self-protection motivation was satisfied by thinking about something clean and so there was no further need to protect the self by behaving deceitfully. Other research shows that washing ones hands can have a similar effect at reducing disgust-induced outcomes. Disgust is not alone among emotions in having functional outcomes. My own research suggests that pride serves the adaptive function of promoting perseverance at goals and leadership in group situations. Gratitude promotes affiliation and trust with others. Emotion functions aren’t always so rosy – jealousy incites aggression and happiness can lead to more reliance on social stereotypes – but these functions do make evolutionary sense. It certainly seems, in light of Winterich and colleague’s findings and with these latter examples, that emotions can lead us astray – at least astray from societal standards for fairness, kindness, and personal connection. Yet, if you look at whether the emotion-driven behaviour is adaptive for the organism, it makes complete sense. This logic is the similar to Richard Dawkins' argument in The Selfish Gene. There are a host of reasons to advocate having clean environs, and reducing self-interested deceit is likely one of them. But it’s important to consider that disgust-driven deceit is one of a number of examples of how our emotion system actually functions to help us navigate our physical and social worlds successfully.

							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								This week we have witnessed a plunge in the price of oil and the astonishing demise of the ruble. These events provide the basis for a great series of conspiracy theories, the type that readily find an audience in Russia and Eastern Europe. Imagine two elderly Russians discussing these issues over a glass of tea. Was this situation the product of the US and Saudi Arabia secretly working together to attack Russia, they ask? After all, the Americans are always trying to contain Russia and the Saudis promote a particularly militant form of Islam among Russia’s large minority Muslim populations. Or was this a conspiracy of western bankers contriving to sell the ruble short and make their fortunes? Or was it both? Whichever our two Russians chose, it has the making of a good Hollywood script. The key question, of course, will be who plays the US president in the movie? If history is any guide, it’ll be an athletic Denzel Washington or a wise Harrison Ford. Vladimir Putin will, of course, be played by Kevin Spacey – unless he is already playing Obama. Then it’ll probably be Jeremy Irons, given his proclivity to play a steely-eyed, sophisticated villain. Conspiracies are always fun because you don’t need any facts. The principle of Occam’s razor, on the other hand, suggests that the simplest explanation is probably the correct one. The writing was on the wall Plentiful supplies and new sources of alternative energy have driven down the price of oil and gas. It is a trend that has been developing for years. Russia has little to sell except oil and gas – and Russian dolls. The economic sanctions imposed by the West against Russia have simply exacerbated the problem. In 2009 Russia steeply raised interest rates and that worked to stem the ruble’s demise. So its central bank tried the same this week. But times have changed. The prospects for oil price rises look bleak. Russia now has a track record of raising rates without then introducing reforms. Both foreign investors and IMF officials feel that they have been cheated by a corrupt Russian system. So they presumably don’t want to jump in and support the ruble again. And they calculate that the Americans, and maybe the Europeans, will introduce more sanctions, not reduce them. Oh, and the Saudis aren’t supporting the price of oil because they sit on piles of cash. They can wait out the demise of their less wealthy competitors – like the smaller American firms investing in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>. You don’t need a conspiracy to see how this happened. Just a handful of relevant facts and a few simple assumptions. But rather than focus on the cause of the current situation, it may be more prudent to think about its consequences. What will happen now? Russia’s economy, recently forecast to contract slightly next year, will now certainly get heavily squeezed. Russia’s few super-rich already have their money nestled in bank accounts in other currencies throughout the globe. A few may even leave altogether for fear that they will get caught in the ensuing crossfire. The new wealthy professional class are lining up to buy everything from imported cars to vegetables as their currency depreciates. Russia’s vast number of poor, hitherto Putin’s most strident supporters, will be the ones who suffer the most. Putin, having calculated that an argument with the West - see Crimea and Ukraine - would enhance his support among Russian nationalists may now have to rethink his strategy. Will his supporters blame the West or reconsider and blame him? It is one thing to cloak yourself in victimhood as you stand up to those disrespectful American bullies. It is quite another when Apple refuses to sell you products while your own finance minister and central bank officials are publicly squabbling. My money is on the two guys sipping tea continuing to blame the West. Russia, of course, cannot be seen to capitulate. Inside of Putin’s Russian doll are the ghosts of former leaders who are seen by Russians to have done so, notably Gorbachev and Yeltsin. As Putin often stresses, he is made of sterner stuff. The fear is that the situation will spiral out of control -– with too great a shock to global markets as a stubborn Putin becomes even more strident in Ukraine. A “grand accord” on Ukraine? So it is now up to the Americans and the Europeans to address the problem. They have demonstrated that their economic power can outwit Russian military prowess. Sanctions seem to have effectively outmaneuvered and counteracted the effects of Russian weaponry. Yet this is not the time, in my view, to try and press home their advantage. They must appear benign and conciliatory, for their own good. However much they may despise Putin, the alternative is potential chaos and confrontation. So the time may have come to make a deal over the future of Ukraine, one couched in the language of a “grand accord.” The most obvious key concessions would allow Russia to keep Crimea and to provide financial assistance to Russia. In exchange, Putin would agree to demilitarize Eastern Ukraine and implement some domestic financial reforms. Letting Putin save face, even claim victory, may not suit the Ukrainians. But I would argue that it is better than any alternative – and avoids the increasing specter of roiled global markets. Otherwise, the Russian doll inside Putin may be Stalin, not Gorbachev.

							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								Everyone needs to understand the basics of science to participate fully in the democratic process. Conversation image via www.shutterstock.com. Science isn’t important only to scientists or those who profess an interest in it. Whether you find fascinating every new discovery reported or you stopped taking science in school as soon as you could, a base level understanding is crucial for modern citizens to ground their engagement in the national conversation about science-related issues. We need to look no further than the Ebola crisis to appreciate the importance of science literacy. A recently elected senator has linked sealing the US-Mexican border with keeping Ebola out of the US, even though the disease is nonexistent in Mexico. Four out of 10 Americans believe there will be a large scale Ebola epidemic here, even though there have been just four cases in the US and only one fatality. Flu, on the other hand, which killed over 100 children here last winter, barely registers in the public consciousness. Increasingly we must grapple with highly-charged and politicized science-based issues ranging from infectious diseases and human cloning to reproductive choices and climate change. Yet many – perhaps even the majority – of Americans aren’t sufficiently scientifically literate to make sense of these complicated issues. For instance, on one recent survey of public attitudes and understanding of science and technology, Americans barely got a passing grade, answering only 5.8 out of 9 factual knowledge questions correctly. Without a solid understanding of the underlying science and its implications for our daily lives, we can neither respond intelligently on a personal level nor hold our public officials accountable for sound policy decisions. Moreover, we risk falling prey to the tremendous power of fear and partisan political rhetoric. By grounding our understanding of issues in knowledge, we can gain the confidence to participate in the science conversation in a thoughtful way. Science literacy is a path to that knowledge. What’s needed to be scientifically literate? Science literacy is a foundational knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes. For example, scientifically literate people should know that science is reproducible, evidence-based information that is fact and not opinion. They should have a working knowledge of the basic terminology needed to interpret the processes and outcomes of science. With this vocabulary in hand, they can engage in the critical thinking needed to apply healthy skepticism and to discern the grey areas and uncertainties inherent in science-based information. As a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cell">stem cell</a></span> scientist, I have spent my life tackling elusive questions such as “what is personhood” or “when does life begin.” Recently, my interest has shifted to helping the public engage in open-minded discussions about these types of questions. The goal isn’t to move public opinion towards one side or another of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cell">stem cell</a></span> or any other debate, but rather to create a forum in which all sides are armed with basic scientific knowledge and have a legitimate voice in the conversation. Get your head around some science basics and you’re ready for the big questions. David Yu, CC BY-NC-ND How to get literate I teach a freshman seminar class at Tufts University called “Science and the Human Experience” that is largely populated with students whose interests are in the humanities and social sciences. The curriculum encourages these not-necessarily-science-lovers to explore the ways science affects their everyday lives. We talk about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cell">stem cell</a></span>s and abortion, right-to-die and drug treatment. We question when does life begin? What can our genome tell us? How do we experience pain? What does it mean to grow old? Students confront the emotional and personal consequences of science and its relationship to their lives. Grappling with these issues is empowering. One student understood, for the first time, that her personal investment in science was connected to a loved one’s struggle with addiction. Another freshman planning on an English major discovered that she was, to her own surprise, “just as capable as anyone else of understanding and applying scientific material to my life.” Students uncover their own, personal rationales for engaging in these issues and then, most importantly, ask themselves, “Why does this matter to me?” They report that to learn the value of science, and to engage deeply in it, is to learn what it means to be human. While knowledge is fundamental to addressing civic, science-based questions, our beliefs and values play an equally important role. As Yale law professor Dan Kahan, who studies science and civic engagement, says “What people ‘believe’ about global warming doesn’t reflect what they know; it expresses who they are.” In fact, understanding the science is perhaps the easier part of the equation. The greater struggle is for people with diverse views on science-related issues to wrestle with these conflicting values. This is a messy but necessary part of a healthy civic dialogue. Therefore, any program to increase science literacy must equally embrace the goals of promoting a respectful, civic conversation that will work towards shared understanding. You deserve to contribute meaningfully to debate about important issues. Lawrence Jackson Informed citizens = productive dialogue So what’s a responsible citizen to do? First, become sufficiently science literate to understand the nuances of the important science-based issues of our day. Next, be prepared to engage in difficult conversations with fellow citizens with different opinions so that dialogue is valued over doctrine, as we work together to balance self-interest with compassion. If everyone comes to the table with a base level of information and a willingness to listen to each other’s concerns, we can replace the polarization of our current public discourse with productive public problem solving. We can then approach each other with a genuine curiosity to build a science conversation that is enlivened by a search for mutual understanding regardless of a position held on an issue. We need not hold the same beliefs or values to find common ground on the important science-based issues that face us today and will only become more urgent in the years ahead.

								<span class="enum">2.</span>Democratic policing: what it says about America today
							</div>
							<div class='description'>
								Citizens and police officers Nick Allen, CC BY-SA The use of lethal force by police officers in Ferguson and Staten Island has raised many concerns about the dynamic between police and citizens and underlined the fact that all time favorite fictional policeman, Sheriff Andy Taylor of the Andy Griffith TV show, is very much an out-of-date representation of what law enforcement is in the 21st century. Today’s ideal is “democratic policing.” This means, broadly, a police force that is publicly accountable, subject to the rule of law, respectful of human dignity and that intrudes into citizens' lives only under certain limited circumstances. In order to reach that ideal, policing in America has evolved considerably over the past fifty years – from who becomes an officer to how relations with civilians are managed and what technologies are used. Demographically, the 20th century has seen a slow but steady integration of minorities and women within police forces. Different managerial models aimed at improving relations with citizens have also influenced policing over the last forty years. The most prominent among these are community-oriented policing (COP), problem-oriented policing (POP), and intelligence-led policing (ILP). Finally, policing strategies and operations have been deeply transformed by the rapid integration of new technologies leading to computerization of police forces, access to a broader range of weapons and the deployment of surveillance technologies. These changes were initiated in the 20th century. Their outcomes are what we are now witnessing: both positive and negative. Not all police forces are equal Policing in America is not a standardized profession guided by an established set procedures and policies. There are at least 18,000 local, state, and federal police agencies in the United States. The US police system is one of the most decentralized in the world. There are more than 600 state and local police academies across the country delivering training programs that vary tremendously in content, quality and intensity. This, inevitably, has an impact on the skills of their graduates. Differences in policing also reflect the quality of leadership and the availability of resources. Police chiefs and commanders represent a critical source of influence. They provide the doctrine (prevention or repression of crime), design strategies (police visibility or zero tolerance), and identify the practice to be adopted (rounding up the usual suspects or systematic stop and frisk). Often these police practices are not aligned with public expectations. Citizen review boards - such as those in New York City or San Diego - are the exception rather than the norm. And then there is the money issue. Police departments that are financially crippled will simply not be able to provide regular training; they will not have the expertise then to pursue certain kinds of crime. The policing of fraud, for example, requires financial expertise and specialized units. From public relations policing to intensive policing Policing styles in America vary according to the targeted audience. Police work in an affluent neighborhoods is often characterized by soft policing strategies. In other words, policing in those areas is more a question of making people feel secure or public relations than actual crime fighting. However, in disadvantaged neighborhoods, police presence and activity are often more intense. They are there to target crimes that have been identified as priorities by police leadership and public officials. In high crime areas, intensive policing can translate into several strategies and tactics. A noticeable trend that is front and center in the media today is the “militarization” of police. This blurring of the distinction between the police and military institutions, between law enforcement and war began in the 1980’s and has only intensified since. It was reinforced by public policy rhetoric calling for a “war on crime,” “war on drug,” and “war on terror.” Police forces began to acquire military equipment and implement militarized training but with little or no accountability. For instance, in the wake of September 11, 2001, several local police departments received funding from the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense with little or no guidance on how to spend the money leading to unnecessary purchase of military equipment including armored cars, bullet proof vests for dogs, and advanced bomb-disarming robots. As a result we have seen a booming of SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams: 80% of cities with 25,000 to 50,000 inhabitant now have a SWAT team (see graph below.) From the late 1990s, through the 1033 program, the Department of Defense has authorized the transfer of military equipment to police departments across the country. Since 2006 the police have bought 93,763 machine guns and 435 armored from the Pentagon. All this has only heightened the real and perceived potential for deadly force by police officers. Author, Author provided Now I see you Another significant change in modern policing is the increasing capacity to monitor criminal activity and the population in general. Police agencies now have access to a vast network of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) monitors, allowing the surveillance of public and private spaces. Just to give a few numbers, the Chicago PD has access to 17,000 cameras including 4,000 in public schools and 1,000 at O’Hare Airport. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span>, too, are increasingly in use. The US Border Patrol deploys them to monitor smuggling activities. They have been purchased by a number of local police departments including those of Los Angeles, Mesa County (AR), Montgomery County (TX) Miami Dade and Seattle. In addition, some law enforcement agencies such as the Virginia State Police allow members of the public to send text and video files of suspicious activity taken from their smartphones. This combined with the ability to process large amounts of data through specialized software has meant that some police agencies - such as that of Shreveport – are now capable of predicting the occurrence of crime in time and space. We may still be far from a “Minority Report” scenario but we have clearly entered into a surveillance society in which risk and harm reduction directly challenge civil rights. This trend has already created problems in the counter-terrorism arena with the creation of erroneous suspect lists and intensive monitoring of Muslim communities . A mirror of society In many regards, police agencies are a mirror of our beliefs and values as a society. When applying this assumption to the phenomenon of intensive policing, it is not surprising, I would argue, to witness the militarization of the police in a nation that has the highest rate of gun ownership among Western countries, the highest murder rate by guns among advanced democracies, and the largest military apparatus of the world. The same reflection can be made about the use of police surveillance technologies in a society where information technology increasingly defines our interactions. Similarly, encounters between police and citizens take place in the larger social framework of racial, class, and gender expectations. Racism, sexism, and bigotry exist within professional subcultures (such as that of the police) but also across society at large. Ultimately, policing is inseparable from politics. Police organizations are constantly influenced by political pressure such as the nomination of a new chief of police or new laws that police will have to enforce. The state of our police system, in other words, for good or for ill is an accurate proxy measure of the state of our democracy.

Over coffee afterwards she discussed her desire to find out more about the lives of the African women for whom she was providing clinical care. I was keen to help, using my knowledge of qualitative research in the sociology of health. We, therefore, planned a collaborative study of the experiences of African women living with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> who were receiving health care in a London hospital.
