                                Facebook/Richard Preston Richard Preston, author of "The Hot Zone," standing with the skull of a crab-eating monkey, a species infected with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in his book. In light of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in West Africa, Richard Preston, author of nonfiction book "The Hot Zone," conducted a Reddit AMA on Wednesday morning. During it, he mostly addressed questions about the spread and containment of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. The book is widely regarded as terrifying, but while Preston did voice some candid concerns about containment, especially in Africa, his answers should comfort those worried about a large-scale outbreak in the U.S. To start, Preston expects only handfuls of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients to appear in the U.S., even in the event of loss of control in West Africa. “The major hospitals [in the U.S.] are equipped to deal with small numbers of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients,” he added. And doctors could even handle a major outbreak, though "it wouldn't be fun at all." And how would a large-scale outbreak in Africa occur? Preston worries that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> could overtake, for example, Lagos, Nigeria, the most populous city in Africa with 21 million people. Two deaths and five cases have already appeared there. (For comparison, the population of Texas stands at 25 million.) "So take most of Texas, cram it into one city, then remove access to good medical [care] for most people, add poor sanitation, and there could be a big problem with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>," Preston explained. Even doctors have contracted the virus in Africa. In some <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> wards, one doctor and one nurse will tend to 30 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients. "We need more doctors and nurses — not even a space suit can totally protect you if the ward is really a mess," he noted. Sealed suits can be punctured; gloves can tear; people might not properly sanitize protective gear after disrobing. Preston also said the possibility that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, currently spread only through close contact and bodily fluids, would become airborne "seems unlikely." While most viruses to tend to evolve and change quickly, especially when invading the human body, "this virus' genes seem to be remarkably stable ... for reasons nobody understands," he said. Thus, Preston called public panic "not entirely justified." He noted this outbreak has a 40% survival rate as well as a promising possible treatment in the ZMapp serum, which may have played a part in saving two American lives. (He called it "amazingly effective," though that assessment may be premature.) "This is a kind of war with a non-human enemy. It is a fairly clever and very aggressive enemy. However, if you are in a jam it is never a good idea to panic," Preston concluded. "That's how you lose." "The Hot Zone," published in 1994, explains the origins and various incidents involving <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>viruses and the related marburgviruses. In early August this year, Preston also wrote a piece for the New Yorker regarding the recent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak.

                                Courtesy Tesla Motors Morgan Stanley analyst and big-time Tesla bull Adam Jonas is out with a new research note about the startup's forthcoming Model X SUV. He isn't holding back, writing: We’d be disappointed if the Model X did not sweep every major Car of the Year award on offer by the automotive media. Taking nothing away from the Model S as an exciting, historically important vehicle, Tesla has learned many valuable lessons since the development of its first entirely in-house designed and engineered product. Tesla has far greater financial and technical resources at its disposal to apply to the Model X line that did not exist for the Model S. Jonas expects the Model X to "overtake Tesla’s flagship S in volume by 2018," as the carmaker ramps up production on the SUV. After Tesla announced second-quarter earnings, CEO <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> admitted that early production versions of the Model S sedan had some problems, but added that the company has addressed nearly all of them in its question to deliver the "Platonic ideal" of a service-free automobile. Jonas has an interesting angle on the Model X, which like the Model S will run on 100% electric power. "We’re expecting the X’s main selling point to focus on driving pleasure (acceleration, handling, AWD), cool features (upgraded infotainment system, falcon door feature, interior room and comfort) augmented by first-to-market safety features in the area of autonomous driving and "car learning," he writes. "Some in the market have described Tesla as a 'one hit wonder' with the Model S," he points out. "We expect the Model X will put that to rest very, very quickly." <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: Tesla Isn't Even Trying to Push The Model X SUV On Interested Customers SEE ALSO: Morgan Stanley On Tesla: 'Whoa' Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                Yesterday, police in San Jose issued a statement apologizing for failing to consult the public ahead of acquiring an unmanned aerial vehicle. Hours later, the department released additional documents showing the department considered itself immune from FAA regulation. San Jose Police Department posted its statement yesterday morning, three weeks after a Motherboard-MuckRock report first highlighted that the department had received nearly $7,000 in federal homeland security funds to purchase a unit.  While the SJPD records staff twice denied having any documents on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s even as its bomb squad worked through the year-long application process, last week the department released its grant application materials and documents confirming it acquired a six-rotor Century Neo 660 in January 2014. While grant materials pitch the SJPD <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> as a bomb squad tool to inspect suspicious packages from a distance, the posted statement outlines additional potential uses, which could include dangers such as active shooters, hostage taking, or other such tactical situations where lives might be in immediate danger. The SJPD statement apologized for lack of transparency around the purchase, and committed to consulting the public before deploying the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> or applying for federal licenses to fly: In hindsight, SJPD should have done a better job of communicating the purpose and acquisition of the UAS device to our community.The community should have the opportunity to provide feedback, ask questions, and express their concerns before we move forward with this project.To this end, we will first develop a community outreach plan before we take steps to deploy the UAS. Following the completion of the community outreach efforts, the Department will then develop the policy and procedures that will provide an appropriate and practical framework to guide our operation of the UAS. At the same time, we will continue to research legal implications and Federal Aviation Administration requirements for the operation a UAS by SJPD. We are confident that this technology can improve certain police operational efficiencies and help enhance public and officer safety in specific critical incidents. However, SJPD will not use the UAS until these outreach and procedural steps have been completed and approved. Previous SJPD statements similarly emphasized that the hexacopter will stay on the shelf until R&D analysts have a chance to research what the Federal Aviation Administration requires for law enforcement to fly <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in domestic airspace. But additional documents released yesterday evening indicate that high-level SJPD officers had erroneously concluded months earlier that the department was exempt from FAA regulation. A March 21 memo signed by Chief Larry Esquivel and authored by the SJPD bomb squad commander asserted that FAA regulations are not directed at hobby store-type crafts similar to the one we purchased." A summary of the memo circulated by email to the chief and several other SJPD commanders in early March simplified things further: "The UAV is not a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> are regulated by the FAA. The FAA doesn't regulate our device." The department's confusion reflects a general consensus across the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry that the FAA has not been particularly clear about where its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> regulations are headed.  But in this case, the FAA has long made clear that all government agencies require authorization to operate an unmanned aerial vehicle in domestic airspace, regardless of the particular body type or where the unit was purchased. Hobby UAVs that weigh less than 55 pounds and fly under 400 feet are exempt from licensing requirements, but hobbyist rules do not apply to governmental applications. In signing off on the memo in March, two months after SJPD purchased its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>, the chief and assistant chief alike called for the city attorney to review its usage. The chief also called for a specific policy to be drafted around UAV implementation, as well as "messaging/outreach to public" as a condition of his approval.

                                Yesterday, police in San Jose issued a statement apologizing for failing to consult the public ahead of acquiring an unmanned aerial vehicle. Hours later, the department released additional documents showing the department considered itself immune from FAA regulation. San Jose Police Department posted its statement yesterday morning, three weeks after a Motherboard-MuckRock report first highlighted that the department had received nearly $7,000 in federal homeland security funds to purchase a unit.  While the SJPD records staff twice denied having any documents on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s even as its bomb squad worked through the year-long application process, last week the department released its grant application materials and documents confirming it acquired a six-rotor Century Neo 660 in January 2014. While grant materials pitch the SJPD <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> as a bomb squad tool to inspect suspicious packages from a distance, the posted statement outlines additional potential uses, which could include dangers such as active shooters, hostage taking, or other such tactical situations where lives might be in immediate danger. The SJPD statement apologized for lack of transparency around the purchase, and committed to consulting the public before deploying the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> or applying for federal licenses to fly: In hindsight, SJPD should have done a better job of communicating the purpose and acquisition of the UAS device to our community.The community should have the opportunity to provide feedback, ask questions, and express their concerns before we move forward with this project.To this end, we will first develop a community outreach plan before we take steps to deploy the UAS. Following the completion of the community outreach efforts, the Department will then develop the policy and procedures that will provide an appropriate and practical framework to guide our operation of the UAS. At the same time, we will continue to research legal implications and Federal Aviation Administration requirements for the operation a UAS by SJPD. We are confident that this technology can improve certain police operational efficiencies and help enhance public and officer safety in specific critical incidents. However, SJPD will not use the UAS until these outreach and procedural steps have been completed and approved. Previous SJPD statements similarly emphasized that the hexacopter will stay on the shelf until R&D analysts have a chance to research what the Federal Aviation Administration requires for law enforcement to fly <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in domestic airspace. But additional documents released yesterday evening indicate that high-level SJPD officers had erroneously concluded months earlier that the department was exempt from FAA regulation. A March 21 memo signed by Chief Larry Esquivel and authored by the SJPD bomb squad commander asserted that FAA regulations are not directed at hobby store-type crafts similar to the one we purchased." A summary of the memo circulated by email to the chief and several other SJPD commanders in early March simplified things further: "The UAV is not a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> are regulated by the FAA. The FAA doesn't regulate our device." The department's confusion reflects a general consensus across the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry that the FAA has not been particularly clear about where its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> regulations are headed.  But in this case, the FAA has long made clear that all government agencies require authorization to operate an unmanned aerial vehicle in domestic airspace, regardless of the particular body type or where the unit was purchased. Hobby UAVs that weigh less than 55 pounds and fly under 400 feet are exempt from licensing requirements, but hobbyist rules do not apply to governmental applications. In signing off on the memo in March, two months after SJPD purchased its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>, the chief and assistant chief alike called for the city attorney to review its usage. The chief also called for a specific policy to be drafted around UAV implementation, as well as "messaging/outreach to public" as a condition of his approval. Four months later, the SJPD has now committed to seeking FAA authorization and developing a policy for its <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> based on public input.

                                Lets be honest with ourselves: we all want to shoot something into space. Whether its a genuine scientific experiment or a box of junk from the basement, the age of citizen spaceflight has awakened a deep desire to launch our own little pet projects into orbit. NASAs CubeSat Launch Initiative has made that goal more attainable than ever, and the agency just announced that it was accepting its sixth round of proposal submissions. So if you have been dying to secure a launch your very CubeSat project, now is your chance to secure a place on a rocket headed for low Earth orbit  sometime between 2015 and 2018. The ideal CubeSat volume is four inches cubed, which equals one Cube or 1U; most CubeSats of this size weigh around three pounds. However, volumes of 2U, 3U, and 6U will also be accepted. The initiative is only open to nonprofits and educational organizations, and the deadline to enter is November 24 at 4:30 PM ET. NASA will announce which projects made the cut on February 6, 2015. If you happen to be from one of the 21 states that hasnt yet launched a CubeSat, then you have particularly good odds, because the initiative is dead set on having every district, territory, and state send at least one CubeSat into orbit. Like Pokemon, NASA has to have them all. The agency aims to check that achievement off the to-do list within the next five years. So far, 114 satellite projects from 29 states have been accepted by the initiative, and 17 of those CubeSats have already launched. Among the coolest of those 17 projects include FIREBIRD (Focused Investigations of Relativistic Electron Burst Intensity, Range, and Dynamics) from the University of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span>, which was launched in December 2013. The satellite investigates magnetospheric microbursts, which have been detected by many orbiting satellites but remain very poorly understood.  FIREBIRD shared its rocket ride with three other pretty awesome CubeSats too, including the University of Michigans M-Cubed-2 color camera, which should be snapping mid-res shots of the Earth as you read this. (Maybe it just finished taking a picture of YOU. Hope youre having a good hair day.) A launch of five CubeSats this past February also included some choice orbital gems, including the popular Kickstarter-funded satellite KickSat, another color camera aboard the University of Colorados ALL-STAR, and a CubeSat containing fern spores called SporeSat. Several other CubeSat launches are scheduled for the coming months, after which the winning entries from this batch will begin their journey to orbit. Nows your chance to get in on the action, so get that proposal ready before November 24 and blast your very own spacecraft off this dumb planet.

                                Yoshiki Sasai was a leading stem-cell scientist in Japan.EPA In 1987, my father, a scientist at the US National Institute of Health, killed himself after a member of his lab committed scientific fraud and he got caught up in the investigation. So I found the news that Yoshiki Sasai, a Japanese stem-cell scientist, had allegedly committed suicide in the wake of the STAP controversy deeply disturbing. The STAP controversy began in January over two papers published in the journal Nature. In them, researchers claimed to have developed a simple method of creating embryonic-like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>, called STAP (or stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency). The claim, if true, would have given stem-cell research a big boost. But, within months, problems with the papers were spotted and the researchers' institute deemed that the lead author Haruko Obokata was guilty of scientific misconduct. Sasai, one of the leading stem-cell researchers in Japan, was a co-author on both the papers, which have now been retracted from Nature. He was, however, cleared of any charges of misconduct. Neither was my father involved in fraud. But as one of the senior scientists on the research project, my father bore the brunt of institutional criticism. And he seemed to have been far more disturbed by it than the people who were found guilty of the fraud. It is hard for me not to place at least part of the blame for my father’s death on the way the scientific community responds to scientific misconduct. Obviously, fraud is a terrible thing. Nothing provides as deep an existential threat to the scientific enterprise than making up data. But as bad as it is, there is something deeply ugly about the way the scientific community responds to misconduct. We need to deal swiftly with fraud when it is identified. But time after time I have watched not only the accused, but everyone around them, be treated with such sanctimonious disdain. Imagine what it must be like to have devoted your life to science, and then to discover that someone in your midst – someone you have some role in supervising – has committed the ultimate scientific sin. That itself must be disturbing enough. Indeed I remember how upset my father was as he was trying to prove that fraud had taken place. But then imagine what it must feel like to all of a sudden become the focal point for scrutiny – to experience your colleagues and your field casting you aside. It must feel like your whole world is collapsing around you, and not everybody has the mental strength to deal with that. We are all so confident this could never happen to us, that it must be that somebody in a position of power was lax, or that the environment was flawed. It is there in the institutional response. And it is there in the whispers. I still remember how the faculty in my graduate department at the California Institute of Technology talked about David Baltimore when Thereza Imanishi-Kari, a researcher with whom Baltimore had published a paper in the journal Cell, was accused of scientific fraud. (Imanishi-Kari was eventually deemed not guilty.) Given the horrible incentive structure we have in science today, it is somewhat of a miracle that more people don’t make up results on a routine basis. It is important that we identify, and come down hard, on people who cheat (although I wish this would include the far greater number of people who hype their results – something that is ultimately more damaging than the small number of people who commit fraud). But the next time something like this happens, I am begging you to please be careful about how you respond. Recognise that, while invariably fraud involves a failure not just of honesty but of oversight, most of the people involved are honest, decent scientists.

                                Concerns about security of US-trained Afghan military.EPA/Jalil Rezayee The US major-general killed in an insider attack at a military academy near Kabul is the highest-ranked US casualty since 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Another 15 officers were wounded, including a German brigadier-general, in the attack during a high-level meeting at a new defence academy that was modelled on the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Major-General Harold Greene was a widely admired communications specialist who was in Afghanistan to oversee the handover from US to Afghan forces, a key role that made him a particular target for armed opposition groups. The incident brings into focus the more general state of security in Afghanistan at a time when numerous sources are reporting an upsurge in Taliban capabilities, and just as the great majority of coalition forces are concluding their deployments. Just last week, President Hamid Karzai’s powerful cousin, Hashmat Karzai, was killed at an Eid al-Fitr celebration at his home in Kandahar Province after a well-dressed guest came up to him and detonated a suicide vest. Hashmat Karzai was close to one of the two presidential candidates, Ashraf Ghani – and the long drawn-out failure to complete that election has added to the air of uncertainty affecting the country. Security problems have developed in many areas. One example has been extensive difficulties with the logistic support for the 7,000-strong rapid reaction force, a key new element in the Afghan Army’s forces. This is heavily dependent on 350 mobile strike-force vehicles made by the US arms company Textron, but spares and other support for the force have simply not been made available, mainly because coalition forces have not been able to ensure sufficient security for Textron to supply the stores. Murdered: Harold Greene EPA/US Army Yet another problem is that as many as 200,000 weapons supplied to the Afghan National Army (ANA) are not accounted for. Given the worries over Taliban infiltration of the ANA, not forgetting yesterday’s attack, the impact of this could be considerable, stretching over some years. Taliban rising By the end of this year, most of the coalition forces will have left the country. Even now, very few patrols are being conducted and the great majority of coalition troops are engaged in the complicated withdrawal process in which efforts are being made to remove or destroy the billions of dollars of equipment brought into the country over the past 13 years. The United States hopes to maintain a force of around 10,000 troops in the country compared with its peak deployment of 100,000 three years ago. Both the presidential candidates in Afghanistan support this, but the upsurge in Taliban activity is causing considerable concern. They and other armed opposition groups are making gains across the country, extending their reach beyond their previous main areas of control in the south and south-east, and are threatening supply lines close to the capital, Kabul. These groups are also responsible for an upsurge in casualties among the Afghan army and police force which was established last year but by the end of the year was running at around a hundred killed every month. In recent months the defence and interior ministries have actually stopped publishing the casualty figures for the security forces, but UN statistics show a 24% rise in civilian casualties in the first six months of this year compared to the same period a year ago. A further indication of the problem is that civilian casualties are more likely to stem from direct fighting between Taliban and government forces rather than roadside bombs, which shows the way in which the Taliban are now fighting more openly. This presents a change in their approach because frontal attacks on western troops in the past were just too costly. US withdrawal on hold? One other aspect of the changing environment is important. The Taliban may have increased their levels of action against Afghan forces, but they are unlikely to push this too far during the summer months – what is euphemistically called the “fighting season”. If they do, then the United States might decide to keep larger forces in the country in order to support the Afghan government beyond the end of this year. The current intention is to keep those 10,000 or so troops in Afghanistan, partly to handle training missions but also to support the use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> and maintain Special Forces for searching out groups that might link to al-Qaida elements in Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan. If the Taliban get so strong that they are threatening the very survival of the Kabul government, then the Pentagon will argue for keeping far more troops in the country. From the Taliban perspective it is better to demonstrate some of their power without making this excessive. They can then bide their time over the next year, work out just how powerful US forces still are in the country, and then undermine the government slowly while consolidating their control of substantial parts of the country. The war in Afghanistan is largely forgotten in the West with all the attention on Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Nigeria and elsewhere, but it is far from over. And judging by the killing of General Greene, US involvement in Afghanistan will stretch over many years to come.

                                It seems an incredibly simplistic solution to dealing with the sick or dead neurons caused by degenerative diseases like Parkinsons and Alzheimers: replace them with healthy ones. But one day, in theory, it just might be as easy as that. In a study on mice, researchers at the University of Luxembourg have made neurons out of skin cells and successfully implanted them into the rodents brains. They published their results in a paper in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Stem Cell">Stem Cell</a></span> Reports, which builds on earlier work on converting <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>. What the new study showed was that after six months the implanted neurons became fully integrated into the brain, forming new synapses and exhibiting normal activity, with no adverse effects. This long-term aspect is the really interesting part here—the fact that they first survive for half a year, which is pretty long for a mouse; the fact that they do not form a tumour; and that they perfectly integrate in the existing network, cellular biologist Jens Schwamborn, who led the team, told me. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Stem cells">Stem cells</a></span> are kind of like a blank slate cell that can be reprogrammed into a specialised cell; weve seen them make skin, blood cells, lung cells, and insulin-producing cells aimed at treating diabetes. Clearly, they can also be reprogrammed into neurons. A slice of brain with one of the transplanted neural <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>. Image: LCSB 2014 In a petri dish, the researchers programmed the neurons from the mices own skin cells, the idea being that there wont be any immune reaction when you use the same organisms cells. They then transplanted them into the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. In principle, its just an injection of cells at a particular position of the brain, explained Schwamborn. The fact that the new neurons started functioning as normal is a step toward replacement therapy—basically, replacing neurons that have degenerated with shiny new ones. But before anyone gets too excited about cures for conditions like Parkinsons, Alzheimers, and Huntingtons, debilitating diseases which have so far eluded any real remedy, bear in mind that translating the work to humans will inevitably take a long time. Its still early stages. Schwamborn said theres an ongoing study to do the same thing with human cells, which hes confident will work, then to be more specific in terms of the cell type they want to use. Here we had a mixture of all possible cell types; by using pre-differentiation conditions, we could push them, for example, to become dopaminergic neurons used for Parkinsons disease, he said. Dopaminergic neurons are the ones that generate dopamine, and that are lost in Parkinsons disease. More long term aims include testing the technique in primates, which is still a while off. And then, if all goes well: personalised cell-replacement therapies.

They published their results in a paper in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Stem Cell">Stem Cell</a></span> Reports, which builds on earlier work on converting <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>. What the new study showed was that after six months the implanted neurons became fully integrated into the brain, forming new synapses and exhibiting normal activity, with no adverse effects. This long-term aspect is the really interesting part here—the fact that they first survive for half a year, which is pretty long for a mouse; the fact that they do not form a tumour; and that they perfectly integrate in the existing network, cellular biologist Jens Schwamborn, who led the team, told me. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Stem cells">Stem cells</a></span> are kind of like a blank slate cell that can be reprogrammed into a specialised cell; weve seen them make skin, blood cells, lung cells, and insulin-producing cells aimed at treating diabetes. Clearly, they can also be reprogrammed into neurons. A slice of brain with one of the transplanted neural <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>. Image: LCSB 2014 In a petri dish, the researchers programmed the neurons from the mices own skin cells, the idea being that there wont be any immune reaction when you use the same organisms cells. They then transplanted them into the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. In principle, its just an injection of cells at a particular position of the brain, explained Schwamborn. The fact that the new neurons started functioning as normal is a step toward replacement therapy—basically, replacing neurons that have degenerated with shiny new ones. But before anyone gets too excited about cures for conditions like Parkinsons, Alzheimers, and Huntingtons, debilitating diseases which have so far eluded any real remedy, bear in mind that translating the work to humans will inevitably take a long time. Its still early stages. Schwamborn said theres an ongoing study to do the same thing with human cells, which hes confident will work, then to be more specific in terms of the cell type they want to use. Here we had a mixture of all possible cell types; by using pre-differentiation conditions, we could push them, for example, to become dopaminergic neurons used for Parkinsons disease, he said. Dopaminergic neurons are the ones that generate dopamine, and that are lost in Parkinsons disease. More long term aims include testing the technique in primates, which is still a while off. And then, if all goes well: personalised cell-replacement therapies.

                                When life gives you lemons, you know what to do, but when it gives you 5.6 trillion used cigarettes every year? A group of South Korean scientists recently published a study that proposes a one-step process to turn nasty ol' flicked butts into something useful—like coating the electrodes of supercapacitors. Cigarette butts are the gross evidence of a nasty habit, and what's worse is they're absolutely everywhere. What's even worser is they're toxic and not biodegradable. Yet 766,571 metric tons of them are going into the environment every year. But the team from Seoul National University sees, if not beauty in trash, then at least some utility. They found that the cellulose acetate fibers that cigarette filters are made of could be turned into a carbon-based coating for the electrochemical components of supercapacitors, which store extremely large amounts of electrical energy for things like backing up batteries, handling the fluctuating demands of laptops, storing the regenerative electrical power from electric cars' brakes—all sorts of stuff. We're going to need more supercapacitors just like we need a place to stick all these cigarette butts, which is why this plan is so appealing. "Numerous countries are developing strict regulations to avoid the trillions of toxic and non-biodegradable used-cigarette filters that are disposed of into the environment each year, the study's co-author Jongheop Yi, from Seoul National University, said. Our method is just one way of achieving this." Well, not so fast. There's still the matter of how one gathers all those butts, which are flicked just all over the place. As long as you're looking to change a social norm, it seems like getting people not to smoke is the better option. Is it more realistic for smokers to always put their butts somewhere? Would butt flickers suddenly start not flicking because they thought those butts could be used in battery manufacturing? But their method seems easy enough: Just burn it up, in a process called pyrolysis. The resulting char has different sized pores, which according to the researchers is ideal. Once attached to an electrode, and tested in a three-electrode system, the researchers found that the material stored a higher amount of electrical energy than commercially available carbon, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=graphene">graphene</a></span>, or carbon nanotube options. Still it's hard not to feel a little skeptical about this endeavor. We've heard about uses for recycled butts before, as Matt Skenazy outlined in a 2011 Miller-McCune (the magazine that became Pacific Standard) article. For example, Skenazy found plans to add the cigarette butts to a surface they already knew intimately: the sidewalk. Grind up the butts and add them to concrete, replacing fibermesh, an anti-cracking agent that is often added to concrete and usually made from polypropylene. The thought is that the concrete would surround the butts — for instance, in a slab foundation — and keep their toxins from leaching into the environment. Or you could use them to protect steel. A 2010 Chinese study demonstrated that extracts from cigarette butts soaked in water could be used as rust control. To test this they tested how well the butts protected steel from hydrochloric acid heated up to 90 degrees Celsius, which is such badass-sounding research, it probably smokes. One just hopes it uses an ashtray.

                                Sophisticated and terrifying: Israeli firepower.EPA/Atef Safadi In the 1982 Lebanon war I served as an Israeli artillery forward observer, my task to pinpoint the PLO’s positions and call in fire from our artillery units. We stayed in the evacuated Al Jamous School, overlooking Beirut. The routine was simple enough: I would pop into the classroom next door from where I would collect the co-ordinates and description of my military targets: “a military camp”, “a mortar”, “an antenna”. I would then return to my room and, looking out of the windows, I would direct our fire on the targets. From time to time I would pause to let the air force get in to drop its munitions; and the navy would fire from the sea. Beirut, in the summer of 1982, was all burning up – a city on fire. There was a purpose to this massive bombardment: to hit Yasser Arafat’s guerrilla force and its weapons – and also put pressure on the Lebanese, particularly those living inside Beirut with no water, food and electricity, so they demanded Arafat get out of Beirut which would then stop our assault. In the end, a Lebanese military officer by the name of Jonny Abdu confronted Arafat who left Lebanon and moved to Tunisa. Looking back now, I’m appalled by our brutal bombing of Beirut. Was it justified to turn this beautiful city into a Middle Eastern Dresden and kill hundreds of innocent civilians in the process? Now to Gaza where, like in 1982 Beirut, the Israeli army is using overwhelming military power to locate and destroy Hamas’s tunnels, to stop them firing rockets into Israel – and also to put pressure on the Gazans (as we had pressured the Beirutis) so they turn their backs on Hamas as a political force. In the process, just as in Lebanon, hundreds of innocent Palestinians have been killed and parts of Gaza, as some sections of 1982 Beirut, have been turned into wastelands. Even worst, UN schools in Gaza which are shelters to more than 250,000 refugees, and their hospitals have also been hit by Israeli artillery and bombs. Wayward artillery Can anything be done so that in the next round between Israel and Hamas, which is inevitable, there would be fewer innocent civilian casualties? The answer to this question is yes. It is indeed possible to reduce the number of casualties on the Palestinian side, but this would require a modification of the Israeli army’s rules of engagement, namely the way it operates, particularly when in close proximity to schools, hospitals and other shelters. On the receiving end. EPA/Mohammed Saber For example, as an artillery officer I know that even now – with advanced technologies – artillery fire is unreliable. As an artillery forward observer, I always looked up to the sky, praying my shells hit the targets and not land on my head. Artillery shells have a strange habit of going astray. In 1996, in southern Lebanon, wayward Israeli artillery shells landed on a UN compound near the village of Qana, killing 106 innocent people. In the current Gaza war many of the innocent casualties were victims of artillery shells landing in the wrong place. What’s needed here is to ensure that heavy artillery is not used in Gaza’s urban areas – particularly not near schools and hospitals. As for Israeli attacks from the air, at the moment, Israeli pilots, or those who dispatch them, can choose from a range of bombs weighing from 250-1,000kg. They often opt for the latter, as they are big enough to destroy the target completely – and the pilots are confident they can hit the target accurately, as they often do. The problem is that the collateral damage of such big bombs is catastrophic in densely populated Gaza; it destroys not only the intended targets but also causes massive damage to nearby structures and kills non-combatants. Such big bombs must be banned altogether from being used in the vicinity of shelters, schools and hospitals. Hannibal Protocol Finally, certain practices employed by the Israeli army should not be allowed to be used, most notably the “Hannibal Protocol”, which is the IDF’s procedure for preventing soldiers from falling into enemy hands. The Hannibal Protocol is yet another product of Israel’s Lebanon wars: a procedure to be used in the first minutes and hours after a possible abduction of an Israeli soldier. It calls on the military to dramatically escalate attacks in the vicinity of any kidnapping – to strike at bridges, roads, houses, cars – everything, in fact, to prevent the captors from disappearing with the abducted soldier. When the IDF thought – wrongly as it turned out - that one of its officers had been abducted by Hamas in the southern Gaza Strip, the Hannibal protocol was activated to a most devastating effect. The army used everything at its disposal – tanks, artillery, aeroplanes, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> – and pounded vast areas in Rafah, causing enormous damage, killing and wounding scores of innocent Palestinians. The brutal Hannibal procedure seems to me to break all rules of war. It should be thrown out of the window and never used again in Gaza. What will ultimately stop the death of innocent Palestinians and Israelis is a peace deal putting an end to the conflict. But in the meantime, a modification of the Israeli rules of engagement could reduce the number of innocent casualties. In 2010, following Israel’s Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip which resulted in hundreds of Palestinian casualties, the IDF produced a document calling on military commanders, operating in densely populated areas, to “exercise judgement and use more accurate weapons, or lower-impact weapons”. It seems, judging from the sheer number of Palestinian casualties in the current Gaza war, that the Israelis are not following their own rules – or the rules were produced at the time as a PR exercise to silence international criticism. There’s no reason to think the Israelis couldn’t change their rules, though. We have international conventions banning, for instance, the use of chemical weapons in war, so it is possible, I believe, to also prohibit the use of heavy artillery, big bombs and cruel procedures in densely populated areas such as the Gaza Strip. After all, it is also in Israel’s interest, as the horrific pictures coming out of the Gaza Strip ruin the country’s already tarnished reputation.

                                Roll up.Katling, CC BY-NC-SA Hollywood makes films that excite and exhilarate; films that make us laugh, cry, connect with humanity – and above all make box office bucks along the way. While most of us would happily say we were going to see an action movie, what about the latest health flick? Three years ago we began compiling a list of health-themed films that could help teach medical students. Our initial criteria was that any film should have a minimum tomatometer rating of 70% on online rating website Rotten Tomatoes. From an initial list of 15, we now now have 32 recommended films that students choose from to review and present in class. Here’s a short list of some of my favourites: 1. Contagion (2011) Let’s get outta here. Alphab.fr, CC BY A star-studded cast battle to contain a new deadly virus. The film tackles the issue of how health officials and doctors respond to a pandemic but also the ethics around how scarce resources could be allocated in a time of crisis. While the virus wasn’t real, the portrayal of the health professional response to pandemic was realistic. The fear of deadly viruses is never very far away in the public imagination – take the current <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus outbreak in West Africa. To plan well for something like this covers policymakers, drug makers, pathologists and a sense of social responsibility from everyone. Tomatometer rating: 84%. Box office takings: US$135.4m 2. Sicko (2007) Moore insurance needed. Shannon Kringen, CC BY Filmmaker Michael Moore’s documentary on the US healthcare system was an eye-opener, detailing the politics of providing healthcare and the tension between personal and governmental responsibility for health. It also covers the influence that multinational corporations (in this case insurance and pharmaceutical companies) have on the health choices people make. Ultimately, Moore takes a critical stance of the system in the US and the its failure to cover its citizens – he found nearly 50m Americans with no health cover at all. Heated political fighting over president Barack Obama’s introduction of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which aimed to make health insurance more affordable shows just how live the issue still is. Tomatometer rating: 92%. Box office takings: US$36m 3. Milk (2008) Milk and White completely incompatible. CC BY-NC Directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Sean Penn as the eponymous Harvey Milk. In 1977 Milk became the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in the US before he was assassinated – by a resentful Dan White (played by Josh Brolin) – the following year. The film earned eight nominations and two Oscars and takes on issues around sexual orientation and prejudice but also about society and later ignorance around an emerging disease: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDs">AIDs</a></span>. Tomatometer rating: 94%. Box office takings: US$54.5m 4. Super-Size Me (2004) Fries in the face of logic. Gauravonomics, CC BY What happens when one man exclusively eats McDonald’s for one month? Plenty of food for thought with this one … Tomatometer rating: 93%. Box office takings: US$20.6m 5. Amazing Grace (2006) A modern take. Mr Stacey, CC BY-NC The movies that provoke the most discussion among our students – the litmus test for educational value – are not necessarily what you may expect. Not strictly a health film, granted, but with modern health implications. Abolitionist William Wilberforce’s life’s mission to abolish slavery is akin to the contemporary challenge of persuading politicians, faced with a strong tobacco lobby, of the financial as well as health benefits of a smoke free country. Tomatometer rating: 70%. Box office takings: US$32m There are many more that could be added to the list. The most recent to be considered is The Dallas Buyer’s Club (2014), the true story of Ron Woodroof, a Texan who hustled the system to get medication to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> patients in the 1980s after he himself was diagnosed. Our next move is to build up a list that covers psychiatry in the movies – and there will certainly be some rich material here.

                                Is the sun setting on West African oil? A platform in Limbe, CameroonVirginieVV, CC BY After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the US made a point of diversifying its sources of oil to reduce dependence on the Middle East. It was a strategic move which promised a huge boost to West African oil exporters around the Gulf of Guinea, but those same countries now face the comedown as the rise and rise of US domestic <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> whisks the opportunity away so quickly after it arrived. It had all the trappings of a gold rush. Nigeria, Angola, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea in particular were identified as attractive sources of oil and therefore destined to become increasingly important to the post-9/11 US energy strategy. West African crude is of high quality, the region was perceived as less hostile to US interests than the Middle East, and the Atlantic Ocean waterways are a more secure shipping corridor compared to those in the Persian Gulf. A 2001 National Energy Policy Report, often referred to as the “Cheney Report” as it was chaired by the then US vice president, identified energy security as a top US trade and foreign policy priority. A wide range of industry experts and commentators predicted that 25% of all US oil imports would come from West Africa, thus expanding the US’ presence in the region. The establishment of the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) in 2007 was considered a manifestation of the “securitisation” of Africa, relating not only to the US-led war on terror but also to the need for the US to secure energy supplies. And US oil imports from its six key suppliers in sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) increased by 40% from 2001 to 2010, whereas total US oil imports increased by only 16%. In the past few years, however, we have seen a rapid increase in US <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil production, a revolution in energy production with major implications for the global energy trade. This has fundamentally upended widely held assumptions about both the future of US energy imports and the role of West African petro-states in supplying them. The question now is not whether the US will depend on West Africa for a quarter of its (diminishing) oil imports, but whether it will be importing West African oil at all. By 2012, US oil imports from sub-Saharan Africa had declined by 59% from peaks only a few years earlier, compared to a less drastic 23% decline in overall US oil imports. Nowhere is this rapid shift felt more acutely than in Nigeria. In three years alone US crude oil imports from Nigeria have decreased by 75%, from nearly 359m barrels in 2010 to 87m in 2013. Based on the US Energy Information Agency’s figures for the first quarter of 2014, US imports will drop by another 75% this year alone to about 22m barrels. Edward Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup Global Markets, predicts that the US and Canada will completely cease importing crude oil from West Africa some time this year. Nigerian oil minister Diezani Kogbeni Alison-Madueke speaks at an OPEC meeting in 2013. Herbert Neubauer/EPA Nigeria is an instructive case study for thinking about how the shale revolution will impact developing states dependent on energy export revenues, in West Africa and elsewhere. There is great concern in Nigeria about the rapidly dwindling US export market, which has been by far the most important destination for Nigerian oil. Nigeria’s oil minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke, identifies US shale oil as “one of the most serious threats” to Africa’s oil exporters as Nigerian oil is now being displaced by abundant and cheap US shale oil and increasing US imports from Canada. The loss of Nigeria’s most important export market is compounded by the ongoing troubles surrounding the country’s domestic production. Exploration for customers Oil theft, sabotage of infrastructure and the general corruption and social conflict that have arisen in the wake of Nigeria’s oil boom are now resulting in international oil companies pulling back from the country. Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have begun to divest themselves from higher risk onshore and shallow water oil fields, with Nigerian and emerging market (in particular Chinese) national oil companies stepping in to fill the gaps. Nigeria and other producers in the region will reorient exports to the EU and Asia. However, these markets, too, will eventually be affected by US production. And the EU is hardly a long-term prospect for West African oil given its move towards cleaner fuels such as renewables and also lower overall energy consumption. With the potential of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil to significantly increase production in other parts of the world, such as China, Argentina, South Africa and the UK, there will likely be increasing insecurity and volatility ahead for producers of conventional oil. In particular the petro-states of West Africa who are highly dependent on oil export revenues and are perhaps least equipped to deal with unpredictable revenue flows and the costs of reorienting their export markets. Oil and gas will remain crucial resources for financing development in an increasing number of African states, but as the “oil curse” has proven, high risk remains ever present.

                                Photos like this are doing more harm than good to wildlife. eric molina/Flickr, CC BY You might have noticed recently that a plague of “selfies” with tigers appears to have overtaken mobile dating app Tinder (where users “swipe right” to indicate interest; left to reject). Globally, so many male Tinder profiles include tigers that there are blogs dedicated to them. But involving tigers in human courtship isn’t without consequences. A recent campaign from Care for the Wild International stresses that tiger selfies place humans and wildlife at risk. When it comes to taking photos with wildlife, tigers are just the tip of the iceberg. Having a photo with an exotic or wild animal may seem harmless, but it can pose a threat to the animal, person and potentially a whole species. Ethical problems A different sort of tiger selfie: in the past tigers were more valuable dead than alive. Wikimedia Commons There are ethical concerns about having photos taken with tigers. Big cat cubs and primates continue to be used as props for photos with tourists, particularly in south-east Asia, where the animals may be drugged, chained up or have teeth and claws (for cats) removed to prevent injury to people. Photos with tiger cubs can also be taken at travelling and roadside zoos and petting displays in malls in the United States. When big cats or primates are fully grown, they are often unmanageable, and may end up locked up in basements, cages or in private zoos. All tiger subspecies are endangered, with fewer than 3200 adults left in the wild (although estimates vary). Today there are more tigers in captivity than in the wild. Fuelling trade If users of dating apps set a popular trend of profile photos with tigers or other rare and exotic species, demand for similar photos may result in unscrupulous businesses breeding animals indiscriminately or poaching them from the wild. Capture of endangered slow lorises for use as photo props and pets has increased as a result of videos posted on YouTube, with illegal trade increasing the species risk of extinction. After removing their teeth to avoid injury to people, these animals can never be returned to the wild. Studies have shown that people who see images of chimpanzees in popular media are more likely to think that chimpanzees aren’t threatened, and that they make good pets. In fact chimpanzees are endangered; and adults are large and stronger than humans, and make terrible pets. Animals in the wild For years, wildlife tourists have been encouraged to “take only photographs, leave only footprints” but photos of tourists interacting with wildlife may fuel unrealistic expectations of “close encounters”. International tourists seek intensely close interactions with large wild animals: swimming with orcas in Norway; cage diving with great white sharks in Australia; or trekking large mammals on land. In the excitement of the moment, tourists may put themselves and animals at risk of injury and disease. International tourist revenues have formed the backbone of national economies, have built schools and clinics, and have saved natural habitat. However, close encounters with wildlife are associated with a number of problems and threats to health of wildlife, humans and the environment. The UK registered charity “Care for the Wild International" highlights the potential negative impacts that interactions between tourists and wildlife may have on people, wildlife and natural habitats. Best-practice guidelines stipulate minimum “buffer” distances between people and wildlife, such as tourists keeping a distance of seven metres from mountain gorillas in Rwanda or Uganda to keep them free from human diseases and stress. Gorillas are highly susceptible to human diseases For some species, such as tigers in India, a fleeting glimpse from a distance may be all that a tourist is likely to get, which may lead to disappointment and damage to future tourism through poor visitor satisfaction. Photos suggest otherwise: a close up, one on one experience. In reality, there may be hundreds of other tourists leading to a less “intimate” experience. You might be one of hundreds of tourists seeking a tiger Selfies to death Apart from the potential suffering and abuse for animals used as photo props, close encounters can be a threat to people. Tigers can be dangerous and kill or maim humans in natural habitats and in captivity every year. Once tourist sites and humans become associated with food, wild animals may lurk around bins, camp sites and tourist spots. Whether in Gibraltar, India, Malaysia or Japan, overly aggressive monkeys beg and snatch for food that makes them fat and unhealthy (monkeys fed by tourists on Gibraltar in the past were called “bags of fat”). The quest for the perfect photo opportunity or memorable close encounter, without understanding the animals’ behavioural repertoire or signs of aggression and stress, increases potential risk of injury to tourists, particularly if the wild animals are overly habituated, losing all fear of humans. Close encounters also risk transmitting disease from animals to people, including diseases from monkeys in south east Asia and recently from camels in the Midde East. Many emerging infectious diseases, known as “zoonoses”, have come from animals, including <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, “bird flu”, and SARS. The way we portray animals in wildlife selfies gives rise to all sorts of misperceptions that might inadvertently be pushing the animals that we consider special towards extinction. Therefore, when you see a potential date cuddling a tiger, I urge you to swipe left.

                                Malaria testing could soon be done in the cloud.US Army Africa Remote diagnostics is an emerging field that allows healthcare workers to perform tests on patient samples in the field and to get results interpreted by medical experts remotely. This is a groundbreaking approach to providing affordable healthcare to patients in some of the world’s poorest countries. Providing healthcare in this way, though, often means using expensive equipment, supplying extensive training and getting access to relatively developed telecommunications infrastructure. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today, we present a device that has the potential to overcome these challenges. The uMED Alex Nemiroski Costing only US$25, the universal Mobile Electrochemical Detector, or uMED, can perform chemical and biochemical tests on a variety of commercially available test strips and electrodes and send the results over an audio cable connected to the headphone jack of any cell phone – even if it isn’t a smartphone. After placing a phone call, the user can upload the data over the voice channel of any mobile network (2G, 3G, or 4G) that is present on site. There is no need for an internet connection. An automated cloud database or a medical expert can then return relevant information about test results to the device by text message. The cloud database might be run by a private hospital or a government agency, which can send help if needed. On the other side, that agency can track the results uploaded through uMED to keep tabs on the spread of a disease. The uMED can be used to test for toxic metals in drinking water, to measure a patient’s blood-glucose and electrolyte levels, and even to quantify and diagnose malaria. It could also be used in the future to screen for other diseases, such as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, E. Coli, hepatitis, influenza, West Nile virus or Dengue fever. There are already various low-cost devices that can be used to test patients' health or to diagnose certain diseases. Pregnancy tests, blood-glucose tests and rapid malaria tests all have their uses but are often too limited in what they can detect. In general, diagnostic tests can be either versatile and accurate but expensive and complicated, or rapid and cheap but limited and insensitive. We believe our approach fuses the strengths of these technological extremes, and avoids their weaknesses. How it works Electrochemical detection is widely used to perform chemical testing in well-resourced laboratories. In this type of testing, a voltage applied to a chemical sample causes a reaction that yields a detectable flow of current. The reaction can be controlled to ensure the current produced is related to the concentration of the chemical sample. In this way, concentrations of various chemicals can be measured by interrogating the samples with electronics. Apart from blood-glucose metres, though, these types of measurements typically need expensive and sophisticated instruments. We redesigned a laboratory electrochemical analyser from the ground up to be affordable and tailored it to specifically measure fluid samples with physiological concentrations. It was important to us that all these sophisticated functions could be offered in a single, automated, hand-held device that resembled a blood-glucose meter, because this device in particular is familiar to a lot of people around the world. To build the uMED, we developed a custom electrochemical sensor compatible with the open-source development environment Arduino. This means the uMED can be easily adapted to local needs, and reprogrammed or updated with minimal training. We also added a vibration motor, similar to those found on cellphones, to mix samples when necessary. This eliminated the need for addition equipment that is typically necessary to stir samples during measurements. Although the use of smartphones is rapidly rising, there remain almost three billion people in the world today who still use older technologies for communication, and according to market trends, that number is not set to decrease much over the next decade. That’s why we needed to make uMED compatible with even low-end phones. There is huge potential to improve the health of people and animals in countries where mobile phones are everywhere but high-tech infrastructure is not. The flow of information from a test taken at the point-of-care to a remote medical facility, and back. Alex Nemiroski For most tests, all a healthcare worker needs to do is insert a strip containing a blood, urine, or water sample (or dip an electrode into the sample), select the test they want to perform, and make a phone call to send the results. These can be glucose test strips, screen-printed electrodes, ion-selective electrodes or ultra-low-cost, paper-based electrodes. The uMED is still a work in progress, and we’re working with devices firm Diagnostics For All to improve its diagnostic capacity, particularly in difficult environments. Field trials will start in India soon, with the hope of moving towards a device that can make healthcare easier, even before the internet arrives in hard-to-reach areas.

                                The news: The world's first commercial space launchpad may not be built in Cape Canaveral or Houston. Instead, the first rockets to lift off from a designated commercial facility will embark from one of North America's poorest — and perhaps, least likely — cities: Brownsville, Texas. Of the Brownsville-Harlingen metro area's nearly half a million residents, 36% live below the national poverty line. Close to a quarter of those 25 or older have only a high school diploma; 37% never graduated high school. Yet this is the city where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> chose to build the world's first commercial launching facility, from which he plans to send up to 12 rockets each year into space. This is huge for Brownsville. Musk was looking for a place at an eastern location relatively close to the equator to take advantage of the Earth's spin. Read More

                                Someone's got to do it.Tulane Publications, CC BY-NC-SA The current West African <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus outbreak, which has now reached more than 1,000 cases and resulted in more than 800 deaths, is a reminder of the often unpredictable nature of viruses and the difficulties in finding and developing vaccines and antivirals. The outbreak appears to have focused efforts. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US, said human trials for a vaccine will start in September with a potential vaccine ready by July. His comments come after two infected US doctors were reportedly treated with a serum, believed to be a monoclonal antibody administered under an FDA compassionate exemption that allows drugs to be used outside clinical trial. But even in the case of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus, it has taken nearly 40 years to get this far (partly due to a lack of funding from pharmaceutical companies) and there is no guarantee that these treatments will be successful. Handling viruses Other viruses that pose a continuous threat of disease include seasonal influenza, measles and mumps, and also viruses that pass from animals to humans, such as the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span> <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus">coronavirus</a></span> and avian influenzas. Understanding these diseases can lead to curbing transmission and the development of new antivirals or vaccines. This is usually done under controlled conditions in the lab or by taking samples in the field and using computers to model virus spread. But it is becoming clear that researchers working on these pathogens don’t agree on how best to study these particularly dangerous viruses and two groups have now emerged with different views. The fear is that this could affect the fields of virology and microbiology as a whole and slow down the speed at which vaccines can be found or developed. The research controversy Controversy surrounds these pathogens because of potential lapses in safety, notably by the Centres for Disease Control (CDC), which admitted employees may have been exposed to anthrax more than once and the NIH, which found six vials of forgotten smallpox (along with other viruses) in a storage room. The most recent uproar was the creation of a dangerous strain of influenza virus by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka and colleagues that could evade the human immune system – in order to aid in the development of new influenza vaccines. In 2010, the labs of Kawaoka and a fellow virologist, Ron Fouchier in The Netherlands, were blocked from publishing work that demonstrated the genetics and characteristics required for avian influenza viruses to transmit between ferrets. As these viruses aren’t normally able to do this and were artificially modified to give them novel properties, the experiments fall under a category called “gain of function” (GOF). The debate rests on whether any potential risk to the public is worth the benefit to be had from an increased understanding of influenza virus biology. The issue sparked a year-long self-imposed moratorium by influenza virologists to assess this but after further guidelines, this type of research has resumed and the withheld studies have been published. Scientists at loggerheads Microbiologists, and virologists in particular, have a long history of working safely with pathogens and have developed effective strategies to protect themselves, the public and the environment from a potential release. Viruses, as well as bacteria and parasites, are classified into biosafety levels, each with their own specific safety strategies. The highest safety categories are three and four (to which <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus belongs), with specialised rooms and buildings together with personal protective gear and rules on coming in and leaving the lab. This is before you consider outside safety checks and funding conditions. Some leading scientists who formed a collective have called for another stop to GOF research. But others who disagree argue that preventing this work would be inhibitory to science and potentially damaging to the field, have instead created another group called Scientists for Science. Their members, backed by the International Union of Microbiological Societies, are confident that current safety measures and high-containment labs around the world are sufficient to protect researchers and the public from any risks involved in working with pathogenic viruses. They believe a broad ban should be avoided in favour of specific consideration on a project-by-project basis. They have called for an independent meeting of scientists, funders and public health officials to work out the best way to proceed, given the difficulty of accurately predicting the future benefits of scientific research. Taking the risk The fact is, if we are to prevent infections and deaths by developing antivirals and vaccines, continuing research into viruses such as influenza and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus is critical. And despite reported lapses in safety in certain labs, changes to current protocols must be balanced against the risks of not undertaking such work, including the bigger potential for spread raised by global travel. Ultimately, working with pathogenic viruses carries some risk. As the most recent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus outbreak and inevitable fears around novel strains of influenza show, finding ways to counter dangerous viruses will require us to go further than we have done so far – and it is something we will need to resolve soon.

                                A patient at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital is currently being tested for the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. Mount Sinai Hospital said in a statement that a male patient arrived at the hospital’s emergency room on Monday morning complaining of a high fever and gastrointestinal problems. The patient had recently returns from a trip to a "West African country" where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> has been reported. The hospital says the patient was placed in "strict isolation” and is being screened for the deadly virus. Jeremy Boal, Chief Medical Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System, told reporters that the hospital plans on working carefully with the CDC to make sure the patient does not have the deadly virus.

More than 700 West Africans have died, and the battle is far from over. Who is really to blame? How about greedy pharmaceutical companies? Scientists have made great strides in developing an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccine, but so far exactly zero candidates have made it past the stage of clinical trials. Vaccines, which require billions of dollars to research and develop, rely on funds from pharmaceutical companies. So despite the fact that many vaccines have made it to the first level of testing, they often can't surpass the intervening hurdles without a big push from private corporations. Here's the problem: Pharmaceutical companies, for whom decisions must make sense financially, won't take a risk on investing in a vaccine for a disease that only surfaces periodically in low-income countries. Governments and research universities are supposed to help by filling the funding gap. Read More

Researchers at IBM are experimenting with an idea for another: a room where executives can go to talk over business problems with a version of Watson, the computer system that defeated two Jeopardy! champions on TV in 2012.

                                From 1990 to 2010, deaths from chronic kidney disease (CKD) rose by about 82% worldwide—the third largest increase among the top 25 causes of death after <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> (396%) and diabetes (93%). In England, about £1·45 billion was spent on caring for people with CKD in 2009–10, just 1·3% of National Health Service spending, and a substantial proportion of this cost was devoted to renal replacement therapy in the small proportion of patients with kidney failure. In July, the UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its clinical guideline on CKD, aiming to ensure consistent identification of CKD and thereby improve management.

                                There are some articles journal editors will wish they hadn't brought to public attention. But there will also be papers they are immensely grateful to have published. One such Lancet paper is Julio Montaner's truly landmark 2006 viewpoint entitled, rather modestly now looking back, “The case for expanding access to highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] to curb the growth of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> epidemic”. The paper began by charting, since its inception in 1996, the rise and impact of HAART. Montaner and his team went on to hypothesise that, “A prevention-centred approach would therefore argue that treating 100% of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected individuals at once could greatly reduce <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission.

That is the conclusion of a report published on July 24th by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), a think-tank run by the eponymous consulting firm.

                                THE star of the show was missing from the skies above the Farnborough air show, Europe’s biggest aerospace get-together, which began on July 14th. The F-35 fighter (pictured), which was to have made its first appearance outside America, is grounded after an engine fire. Not taking to the air when expected is a trait of Lockheed Martin’s jet. It is years behind schedule and stratospherically over budget. Its absence is an embarrassment for Lockheed but, then again, its presence might have reminded the defence officials shopping for kit at Farnborough of just the sort of complex and expensive programme that they want to avoid signing up to in future.Arms-makers are going through a lean period. Some big contracts, such as ones to make bombers, trainer aircraft and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, are still up for grabs in America, the world’s biggest spender. But it and other rich-world governments, struggling to curb their deficits, are trying ever harder to get the most bang for the fewest bucks. The revenues of 17 of the top 20 American weapons-makers shrank in 2013. American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had helped to push global spending to a record $1.7 trillion in 2008. Since then it has plunged by $100...

                                FOR years the BRICS countries have insisted they are more than an acronym. To dispel any lingering doubts, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, who gathered in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza for their sixth annual summit on July 15th, announced the creation of two financial institutions: the New Development Bank (NDB) to finance infrastructure and “sustainable development” projects, with $50 billion in capital to start with, and the $100 billion Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), to tide over members in financial difficulties.On the surface, the NDB and the CRA, which must still be approved by the five countries’ parliaments, look like upstart rivals to the World Bank and the IMF, together the cornerstone of the post-war economic order. The BRICS complain that the Bretton Woods outfits, named after a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> town where they were conceived 70 years ago this month, give the developing world short shrift. China, whose economy is second only to America’s, has fewer votes there than the Benelux countries. America and Europe have proved shamefully slow to redress the imbalance.Recipients of IMF cash also resent the tough reforms on which help is conditional, not to mention the lecturing tone in which they are dictated.
