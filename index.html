                                Cry, the beloved country. Pakistan mourns the victims of Karachi airport attacks.EPA/Shahzaib Akber Reports that Pakistan has launched an offensive against militants in North Waziristan come after years of pressure from the West for Islamabad to deal with the wild border region which has for many years been a haven for terrorist activity between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Some 30,000 troops are said to have been mobilised for Operation Zarb-e-Azb supported by air strikes which reportedly killed 50 insurgents at the weekend. In a statement, the Pakistani military said: “Using North Waziristan as a base, these terrorists had waged a war against the state of Pakistan and had been disrupting our national life in all its dimensions, stunting our economic growth and causing enormous loss of life and property.” The decision to launch the operation has been seen as a significant victory for the military over prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who had been trying to come to terms with Taliban leaders. He fears that any offensive against the region would lead to a backlash in terms of terror attacks in Pakistan’s big cities. This fear, highlighted by last week’s Taliban-led attacks on Karachi airport, in which 38 were killed, is an indication of the tenuous hold Pakistan’s central government has over national security. Many have begun to question Pakistan’s survival as a state – pointing to the failure of the country’s democratic institutions, the lack of authority of its central government and the serious threat it represents to international security. Turbulent history of terror In 2010 world, the US set out its strategy for Pakistan in the Council for Foreign Relations Task Force report, writing that “the US objective in Pakistan is to degrade and defeat terrorist groups that threaten American interests from its territory and to prevent turmoil that would imperil Pakistan state and risk the security of Pakistan’s nuclear programme”. The goal was to “prevail on Pakistan to stop providing support to the Afghan Taliban and Pakistani terrorist organisations.” But this goal is far from achievable. Pakistan continues to be the hub of Islamist terrorist organisations and faces many social and economic challenges – such as illiteracy, gender inequality and poverty, which only serve to exacerbate the possibility of breeding further terrorist activity. Pakistan has appeared for many consecutive years on the Failed State Index. It tops the list of bomb blasts per year. It is consistently among the worst offenders in terms of its human rights record, its record on women’s rights and the rights of its religious minorities, including Shia Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Sikhs. Security services respond to Karachi airport attacks. EPA/Rehan Khan Prime minister Nawaz Sharif has been faced with both economic and security crises. While Pakistan’s economy is showing some signs it might be turning the corner after years of crisis and deficit, corruption is rampant and systemic and the security of women, religious minorities and, increasingly, everyone else, cannot be guaranteed. Problems, problems … Despite US military and economic aid to Pakistan, anti-US feeling is very strong in Pakistan, especially after 9/11. The killing of Osama Bin Laden by American forces, incursions into Pakistan by Afghanistan-based US military and the growing number of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> strikes which have killed numerous civilians have fuelled this sentiment. However the US is strongly aware of the perils of allowing Pakistan’s nuclear capability to fall into the wrong hands. While the track record on this has so far been adequate, the successful penetration of security in attacks such as last week’s at Karachi airport highlight the dangers inherent in a politically unstable state with a nuclear capability. Washington has continually pushed for an increased role for civil society in Pakistan’s polity – the transfer of power away from the army and the intelligence service (the ISI) has been a major priority, but it remains to be seen whether adding “Aawam” (people) to the traditional “three A’s” of Allah, Army, and America, will work out. Under Sharif, the priorities seem to have been strengthening democratic institutions, fixing the parlous economy, mending the country’s traditionally turbulent relationship with India and solving what is perhaps the most intractable problem between the two countries: Kashmir. The economy is showing positive signs, according to a recent World Bank report, which identified steady growth, a recovery in manufacturing and stabilising unemployment as big positives but warned of a lack of investment from overseas capital spooked by an insecure political environment and a continuing trade deficit. So far, though, so positive. And Sharif was the first Pakistani prime minister to attend the inauguration of an Indian head of government when he visited Delhi last month to witness the swearing in of Narendra Modi. But the development of cordial relations between the two leaders will depend on both sides' restraint over Kashmir and increased shelling of the Line of Control last weekend won’t have helped matters. Continuing problems with Pakistan’s powerful and seemingly unaccountable Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) which is said to play both end off against the middle while pursuing an agenda which appears to opaque even to the highest levels of politics, are perhaps best expressed by the tale of the broadcaster whose licence was suspended last week after it dared to criticise the ISI. Geo News had reported a claim that the ISI’s chief, General Zaheer-ul-Islam had ordered the shooting of investigative journalist Hamid Mir which left the reporter seriously wounded in hospital. Amnesty International reported that at least 34 journalists had been killed in Pakistan since 2008 and that “no state actor is more feared by journalists than the ISI”. Meanwhile the public stoning to death of a pregnant woman outside the High Court in Lahore for defying her family’s wishes about who she should marry is another chilling indication of the fragility of the rule of law in Pakistan. Whether Sharif – or any democratic leader in a country beset by such challenges – can establish a strong enough political base to wrest power from the military and intelligence services will be key, not just to his survival, but to the very survival of Pakistan as a viable state. Events in Karachi last week are a suggestion of just how hard this will be.

                                Dealing with the leftovers.Midnight Talker, CC BY-NC We can all, in general, expect to live a little longer than our grandparents did – and, until recently, many of us have had expectations to live to an older age than our own parents. In addition to living longer, our risks of disease and causes of death are changing. Data from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease survey showed that all around the world populations are shifting away from infectious diseases towards non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs represent a wide range of conditions, among which the most common are heart disease, strokes, and lung diseases. Long thought of as diseases of the rich world, they are rising everywhere: by 2030, NCDs will be the most common cause of death in Africa. Risk Factors Among the top ten global risk factors for disease identified in the 2010 survey, at least half were associated with “consumer lifestyle” – tobacco smoking (ranked number two), alcohol use (number three), low consumption of fruit (number five), high body mass index and high plasma glucose (numbers six and seven, respectively). The number one slot was occupied by high blood pressure – with its multitude of drivers and causes. The institutions that co-ordinate global responses to health problems – most notably the World Health Organisation – were established many decades ago, in an age when the main dangers to health were predominantly infectious diseases (tuberculosis, respiratory infections, diarrhoea, polio, and so on). At the time, they tended to see the biggest transnational threats to health arising from the potential spread of infection across national borders – a problem which grew in prominence as the world globalised, and cross-border movement (of people and animals) became more widespread. Countries developed mechanisms for co-operating to control the spread of infectious diseases, both within their own borders and beyond, and had marked success against a number of pathogens (for example, smallpox, SARS, and polio until recently). A 21st century response However, the current threats to health and well-being pose a very different set of challenges. While the WHO and its sister institutions had some success in regulating international health policy in an era characterised by infections and epidemics, can they succeed in promoting and protecting the health of the public where threats to health are now associated with exposure to the products of big business? Transnational threats to health in the early 21st century arise predominantly from private sector companies selling tobacco, alcohol and manufactured foods and drinks (the consumption of highly processed foods typically high in salts, fats, sugar and additives may be displacing fresh foods among some populations. Regulating these threats to health is no longer as (relatively) simple as thinking about how to monitor, control and treat infectious pathogens. Instead, the “guardians of global health” are now faced with the challenge of negotiating with interests whose very existence depends on the sale of products that can be actively harmful to human health. Regulation or co-operation? If governing states has proven challenging for international organisations, the prospect of constraining private sector interests through the same mechanisms is a distant dream. Given this, what model could negotiations take? Should the global health community promote regulation, or co-operation? Can we legislate our way out of a public health crisis, or can we rely upon informed consumers to make the right choices? The rise of NCDs has highlighted a serious regulatory blindspot, and raised important questions about who is capable of protecting global health. The challenge is vast. In 2011 the World Economic Forum (WEF) said NCDs posed one of the greatest threats to economic development and state stability. The problem – like our waistlines – is not getting any smaller. The WEF estimated that NCDs will cost poorer countries an average US$500 billion a year to tackle. At first glance, the balance of negotiating power seems heavily stacked in favour of private sector industries, as the chart below illustrates. In terms of financial resources, the private sector has wealth beyond the wildest dreams of those concerned with health promotion and protection. And as Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organisation so succinctly put it in 2013: “market power readily translates into political power.” Resource inequalities – private and public institutions concerned with NCDs. Sarah Hawkes People, not financial, power Financial resources are just one aspect of power. In the past few decades, democratic and social movements have also brought about changes in the landscape of global health negotiations. From organisations demanding access to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> medicines in the global south, to co-ordinated global protests against the promotion of infant formula feeding, global health has a strong history of civil society movements bringing about changes in the way the private sector (for example pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers of baby milk) does business. For now we don’t have strong movements of citizens demanding changes to the way sugar is promoted to children, while young people are encouraged to associate alcohol with the positive imagery of sex, sport and good times. But this may change. If life expectancies fall (as predicted), and the full extent of the costs to society of tackling the negative health consequences of – for example – drinking alcohol, are finally calculated, will civil society demand action, and will decision-makers listen? Within living memory we have moved from an era of death and disease transmitted by infection, to death and disease associated with consumerism and choice. Understanding how to reduce risks in this this changing environment means, at heart, asking fundamental questions about the nature of global health and society and who will hold private sector companies to account for the impact of their actions. At its heart will be whether profit and public health can co-exist in an equitable society.

                                Amazon is known for its mastery of logistics and efficiency, but when the company allowed Wired to take a look in one of its warehouses in Phoenix, it became clear how a modern online retail giant runs its operations in 2014: a perfect balance of robots and workers. While we're still a ways away from completely robotized Amazon "fulfillment centers," the company has done the next best thing. It has essentially optimized the ratio of humans to machines in its warehouses worldwide, Wired reports. The number of each they've chosen leaves their operations as efficient as possible. The world's largest online retailer employed more than 117,000 full-time and part-time workers across the globe, according to a report from GeekWire from January. Still, its warehouses use conveyor belts to transport items and machines to print and stick mailing labels on them. A computer keeps track of every item in the facility via bar code. All of this happens in conjunction with workers who act essentially as efficiently as machines with thumbs, Wired reports. Of course, this is all coming from the company that famously announced last fall it plans to begin shipping products via <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>.  This sort of wildly ambitious infrastructure is what sets Amazon apart and ahead of competitors, from Wal-Mart and Target to the Chinese Alibaba.  "That stuff is hard to replicate, and it's really hard to short circuit as well," CEO of e-commerce analysis company ChannelAdvisor Scot Wingo told Wired. "There are certain things in the world that you can't just hack and reverse-engineer quickly." <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: Why Amazon will release its own smartphone Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                Sometimes a hacker does something so brilliant, we can't help but marvel at it. In this case, a hacker figured out how to control certain home networks to mine for a computer currency called <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></span>, netting over half a billion dollars in a matter of months. The hacker's exploits were documented by Dell's security team, which points out that the hacker used a competitor's computer storage product to do the dirty work.  The Dell team traced the likely culprit to a German-speaking person who goes by the code-name of "Folio" on GitHub. (GitHub is a cloud service where developers post and share their software projects.). Folio used a security flaw in a computer storage product called Synology, Dell says. Synology's computer storage product is easy to set up, so it has become popular with people who store a lot of songs, movies, and other multimedia files on their home networks. In 2013, a security researcher discovered a flaw with the Synology product that let a hacker find, and ultimately control, these computer storage devices by searching for them on Google.  The company fixed the vulnerably and released a patch. But between the time the researcher told the world about the flaw and the company patched it, the hacker named Folio went to work. Folio discovered vulnerable computer storage boxes and put them to work to "mine" for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></span>.  <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></span> is a computer currency like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and is created by "mining," which involves getting computers to answer a series of cryptographic questions to unlocks new coins. It takes a lot of computing power to answer these questions. People actually buy specially made computers to do it. Or, if you are smart enough, you can string together a bunch of computers owned by other people and put them to work mining for you. Folio was able to nab 500 million <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></span>, equivalent to $620,496, finding most of the coins in January and February right before the patch was released, the researchers discovered. The Dell team thinks this could be the most profitable illegal hacker mining operation of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></span> ever discovered.

                                The toxic effects of cigarette smoke reach far into the lungs.Flickr/SOCIALisBETTER, CC BY-SA Almost everyone will know someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): an incurable disease of the lungs that makes breathing difficult. Never heard of it? Well, chances are you’ve heard of “smoker’s lung”, emphysema or chronic bronchitis – all of which fall under the umbrella term COPD. Causes and prevalence According to the World Health Organization, 64 million people worldwide have COPD. And while the prevalence varies from country to country, around one in every 13 Australians over the age of 40 have the illness. COPD essentially develops as a result of long-term exposure to airborne toxins. Across the western world, the main risk factor is exposure to cigarette smoke. However it’s a slightly different story in developing countries, where years of exposure to biomass fuel smoke (wood smoke, for example, from cooking or indoor heating) is an important cause in people who do not smoke cigarettes. Even so, COPD related to cigarette smoking is projected to increase in the developing world, as smoking rates continue to increase to alarmingly high levels. By the latest estimates, more than 30% of 11- to 15-year-old children smoke in some parts of Africa. The WHO estimates that, without intervention to cut risks, the total number of COPD deaths will increase by 30% over the next ten years. Harmful effects The toxic effects of cigarette smoke reach far into the lungs, affecting almost every part of them to varying degrees. A person with COPD may have inflammation and narrowing of their airways (bronchitis). They may have destruction of the lung’s tiny air sacs, with holes scattered throughout their lungs like Swiss cheese (emphysema). Most likely, they have a combination of both. Shutterstock It probably matters little to a person with COPD precisely what pathological processes are brewing inside their chest, since they all contribute to the same debilitating symptom: breathlessness. The lungs are not the only part of the body affected in this disease. COPD is also associated with disorders of the cardiovascular system, weight loss, muscle wasting and chronic inflammation. Even in Australia, COPD can occur in people who have never smoked a cigarette in their lives. In these people, the cause may not be quite as apparent. It may be the result of occupational exposures (to dusts or fumes, for instance), or the presence of other lung diseases such as long-standing asthma or tuberculosis (although COPD develops only in a minority of people with these conditions). Even more elusive is the cause of COPD in people who have no identifiable risk factors at all. Genes probably play an important role in these cases. Therapies Despite this dire portrait of COPD, treatments are available. Generally speaking, treatment starts with inhaled medications that open up the airways, known as bronchodilators. Some people require the addition of anti-inflammatory medications such as steroids. Inhaled medications can open the airways. Pewari, CC BY-NC-SA Clinicians often prescribe non-medical therapies such as pulmonary rehabilitation – a tailored, supervised exercise program for people with lung disease. At the extreme end, some people may be offered a lung transplant, although in Australia this is quite rare. Obviously, advice and support on smoking cessation is an important part of any treatment plan, and is essential at all stages of the disease. But most of these therapies have been around for many years. So where are we headed? Future treatment The future of COPD treatment really is as varied as scientists' imagination. Most proposed new therapies target inflammation. Other research focuses on developing better bronchodilator medications, decreasing the size of each drug molecule to deliver it deeper into the lungs. A more novel approach to treating COPD is to design therapies that essentially rebuild the lungs. The biggest problem in treating COPD is that current treatments cannot replace the missing lung tissue, and this has lead some researchers to propose that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cell">stem cell</a></span> therapy may be a viable treatment option. As exciting as this may sound, it is likely to be many more years before such therapy makes it into clinical practice. Despite research into new therapies, when it comes to COPD, prevention is still better than cure. Australia has long been a world leader in tobacco control, an accolade we can be proud of. The hard part will be maintaining momentum and avoiding complacency as smoking rates decline. Research needs to continue into effective education and control measures, so that COPD might one day be relegated to the history books rather than top of the list of preventable lifestyle diseases.

                                Hard sell: can Obama convince Americans to trust Iran?EPA/MARTIN SIMON / POOL Charles Dudley Warner’s oft-quoted suggestion that “politics makes strange bedfellows” is never better illustrated than the prospect of a rapprochement between Iran and the United States. Stimulated by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria’s (ISIS) rapid military advances in Iraq, both sides find themselves on the same side – albeit for vastly different reasons. Iran wants to preserve the Shia government and, with it, Iran’s new influence there as part of a broader regional strategy. The Obama administration’s goal is to sustain Iraq as a country, thereby avoiding the creation of yet another “ungovernable territory” in which jihadists can be trained as terrorists and organise attacks on American interests both at home and abroad. The irony is evident. Tehran and Washington, have fought a proxy war for more than three decades by supporting Hezbollah and Israel. But facing a common enemy, they now contemplate having to co-operate out of necessity. Doing so will not be easy. The leadership on both sides will have to overcome significant domestic and – to no small extent – international opposition in order to do so. Barack Obama has already faced significant opposition from Republicans at home over the multilateral agreement with Iranians over their nuclear programme. Republicans have a widespread lack of trust of Iran’s mullahs and the Revolutionary Guard. They believe that Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, is not in charge: that his reformist agenda is too fragile and that he is not a reliable negotiating partner. He is a more amenable face than his predecessor, the widely despised Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but little more. US divided on Iran A Pew opinion poll survey of the American public at the end of last year reflected this broad concern. A plurality of 42% disagreed with the multilateral agreement reached with Iran. Interestingly almost exactly the same percentage of the American public – 43% – holds a very unfavourable view of Iran. In other words, there is a solid bloc in the US who will oppose working with Iran on any issue. Most of them, however, can not be counted among the president’s supporters. And in Washington’s partisan climate, his record suggests Obama is unlikely to take their views into account when it comes to deciding on American foreign policy. Hassan Rouhani needs to sell a rapprochement to Iran’s conservatives. EPA/S Sabawoon The clear exception to this generalisation is America’s Jewish community. They are traditionally stalwart supporters of the Democratic Party. As a whole, they are deeply distrustful of Iran. Yet they fragment on the issue of whether and how to engage its new leaders. A minority, for example, lined up solidly behind Benjamin Netanyahu’s view that the nuclear agreement with Iran was an “historic mistake”. Reluctantly at times, they sided with the president’s Republican critics. The majority of American Jews, however, supported the nuclear agreement, nonetheless invoking the adage that the US should “trust but verify”. Meanwhile, Israelis are understandably worried by the prospect of Tehran’s further engagement with the US. To them, it is another sign of Iran’s growing regional importance. No appetite for war So how can we evaluate the prospects for further US-Iranian engagement against this backdrop? President Obama has clearly repudiated the idea that the United States will return troops to Iraq in large numbers. Poll after poll suggests that the American public is in no mood for a large-scale foreign military intervention anywhere, let alone in Iraq. Having spent the first six years of his presidency extricating America from two wars, President Obama is not inclined to dive back into that morass. All presidents in their second term look towards their legacy, and he wants to preserve his own as a president who ended wars, not one that initiated them. The purpose of the small troop deployment that will be sent to Baghdad, he therefore made clear, is to protect America’s embassy – and more importantly American lives – should they be needed. There will be no large-scale deployment of American “boots on the ground” in Iraq. Yet this does not preclude the use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> or fighter jets to repel ISIS, signaled by the movement of the George H W Bush aircraft carrier into the Persian Gulf. The fact that their use against ISIS could effectively reinforce Bashir Al-Assad’s position in Syria will only add pressure on President Obama to then turn his attention again towards Syria, as that humanitarian crisis mounts. As usual, complications in the Middle East abound. View from Tehran The clear and abiding question concerns what the Iranians will do with that newfound influence if they do work with the Americans? If, as a result, the mullahs feel emboldened and become more demanding, then any expedient accord will be short lived. In that case a temporary respite to the generally hostile trend of the last three decades could actually be followed to a worsening of the state of affairs. Critics of the president’s policy of engagement will predictably – and perhaps justifiably – accuse him of naivety. The prospect of further nuclear program agreements and an easing of multilateral sanctions against Iran will be irreparably damaged. Meanwhile in Iraq: Shia militias assembling in Baghdad. EPA/Stringer If President Obama engages with Iran, he will be taking a grave political risk. Yet if the mullahs reward Obama’s political bravery and set aside their historic antipathy towards America, there is the tantalising prospect of another course of action that could change the future of the Middle East. If they back Rouhani, if they use this moment as a platform for a policy of reassurance towards America and Europe rather than one of confrontation, then it could spark a virtuous circle of improved relations. That co-operation could extend across several key policy issues. Both Iran and the West would benefit from this development. Even Israel might be convinced of its value if – and only if – Iran would subsequently abandon its long-held support for Hezbollah. Iraq and Syria are in crisis, a crisis that is quickly engulfing the region. But never was the adage that “out of crisis comes opportunity” more evident. Middle Eastern and American leaders have always been quick to reject such opportunities. Maybe this time they will surprise us.

                                Hopefully the hats died with the terminology.Archives New Zealand, CC BY-SA I downloaded a new keyboard onto my phone yesterday and was pleasantly surprised to see it suggesting the word “to” after I had typed “going”. It “knew” that the phrase “going to” was a very common pair of words and managed to use this in order to speed up the message I was sending. The next word it suggested was “be”, and then “late”. While I was less pleased that to see my phone pre-diagnosing my punctuality problem, it had indeed correctly predicted the message I planned to send. This is a practical application of something called “corpus linguistics”. And now that the good people of Google have developed a tool called the n-gram viewer, some of its insights are open to all. Anyone can now become an armchair linguist. Corpus linguistics is essentially a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> approach to studying language that predates the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> age. It can be traced back to the earliest days of linguistic study, when people counted the frequency of words and other patterns in the Bible. But it has really taken off in the past 20 years thanks to a massively increase in the availability of sources. Sometimes these collections, known as corpora, are massive online libraries: sometimes they are smaller and more specialised. But none is larger than Google Books, which provides us with an unparallelled treasure trove of sources to scour in our quest to understand how language has changed. Studying these sources has greatly enhanced our understanding of how words work together, and also how they may carry certain other qualities. We know, for example, that the verb “cause” is often used in a negative sense, as in “cause a problem” or “cause delays”, whereas the term “lead to” is generally more neutral. Many big sources of language contain millions of words but Google’s database, sometimes called the World Brain, contains millions of books. It’s a collection that has emerged out of Google’s attempt to digitise every book ever written. A huge team of people and robots are working to scan hard copies of books to add to the database and while it is nowhere near complete, its size is already extraordinary. The n-gram viewer lets users find out how often a word has appeared across the whole library of books and the results are illuminating. If you type in the words “email”, “telegram” and “telephone” into Google Books, for example, you can see how these various forms of communication technology have come in and out of fashion over the years. You can see that use of the word “telegram” peaked in the 1920s and 1930s before beginning a steady decline. You can chart the rapid rise of email in our lexicon since its introduction into the mainstream in the 1990s and see how we appear to fall in and out of love with the telephone. And if you put in the word “wireless”, n-gram shows how the word was popular, then got lost in the wilderness for some time before coming back with a different meaning. Changing attitudes There are other shifts that can be seen beyond the use of technology. A comparison of the phrases “air stewardess” and “cabin crew” is one example of the rise of gender neutral language since the 1970s. It also shows the persisitance of the gender specific variant. Sometimes the data can be deceptive though. The graphs show that “male nurse” is a much more common phrase than “female nurse” but that its use has been in decline since the 1970s. But that doesn’t necessarily mean there are more male nurses or that fewer men have become nurses in the past 40 years; it may simply have seemed necessary in the past to explicitly state that a nurse was male when the profession was more readily associated with women. Peace and love Some of the charts can be fairly depressing, while others can be uplifting. Anyone will tell you that the path of true love never did run smooth, and nor has our use of the word over the years. Google tells us that peace seems to be making a comeback after a tough few decades, as do faith and hope. But charity is far less talked about. Politics and Language This is a blunt tool but it can provide a jumping off point for investigating some complex issues. Use of the term “neo-liberal agenda” has overtaken the term “socialist agenda” in recent years. It’s not immediately clear why but trying to find that out could take you in all kinds of directions. And some graphs can make us instantly question a popular belief. The term “broken Britain” has become something of a catchphrase for the current UK government, but it seems it actually has a surprisingly long history. The fact that its use spiked around 1950 and again in the mid-sixties might put to bed the idea that the youth of today are worse than ever. There are of course many things that don’t turn up in n-grams and many pose more questions than they answer but they give a fascinating insight into the way language has changed to reflect our culture. Or perhaps, as some graphs might indicate, the culture is changing to reflect the language.

                                Ebola might be happy but you won't be.CDC/Cynthia Goldsmith/Public Health Image Library This morning you woke up feeling a little unwell. You have no appetite, your head is aching, your throat is sore and you think you might be slightly feverish. You don’t know it yet, but Ebola virus has started to attack your immune system, wiping out the T-lymphocyte cells that are crucial to its proper function. These are the same cells that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> virus (<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-1) attacks, but Ebola virus kills them far more aggressively. Exactly when and where you caught Ebola virus is unclear, it can take anything between two and 21 days from initial infection to the first symptoms. What is more certain is that you are now infectious yourself. Your family, friends and anyone in close contact with you are all in mortal danger. The next week or so will determine if you are one of the lucky minority who survive. In the 24 Ebola virus outbreaks prior to the present one, a cumulative total of 1,590 people, two-thirds of all cases, have died. The current outbreak, which began in the village of Meliandou in eastern Guinea in early December 2013, and which has now spread across Guinea and into the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia, has killed 251 people as of June 5, nearly half of the identified cases. The west African Ebola epidemic is now the largest outbreak seen since Ebola virus was discovered in 1976. The World Health Organisation issued its first communiqué on the situation on March 23, and since then has been producing regular reports. Ebola 1979-2008 Zach Orecchio , CC BY-SA Over the next few days your condition deteriorates. Your body aches all over, you have chronic abdominal pain, the fever intensifies and you start to vomit and develop diarrhoea. After anything between a couple of days and a week of misery, you will have reached the crisis point – now the symptoms will either gradually recede or you will progress to the horrors of “cytokine storm”, a convulsion of your ravaged immune system that will plunge you into the terminal phase of Ebola virus disease known as haemorrhagic fever. Cytokine storm releases a torrent of inflammatory molecules into your circulatory system. Your own immune system, now completely out of control, attacks every organ in your body. Tiny blood vessels burst everywhere and you begin slowly to bleed to death. The whites of your eyes turn red, your vomit and diarrhoea are now charged with blood and large blood blisters develop under your skin. You are now at the peak of infectiousness as Ebola virus particles, ready to find their next victim, pour out of your body along with your blood. Fortunately, however, it seems you have survived. Rehydration therapy kept you strong in the initial phase and pure luck saved you from haemorrhagic fever. Understanding why some Ebola virus patients avoid the terminal phase is an active area of research, and one possible answer is that those whose T-lymphocytes survive the initial attack of the virus possibly retain sufficiently intact immune systems. Even when you are merely in the first phase of feeling vaguely unwell, it may be possible to determine if you will live or die. Even though you are feeling much improved, and perhaps even ready to return to work, you will remain infectious for a while. All your bodily fluids will still contain virus. In particular, the virus can be sexually transmitted, especially if you are a man, up to 40 days after recovery. Epidemiological modelling studies have shown that Ebola virus is about as infectious as influenza or very slightly more so – each infected person will probably infect two to four others. That’s not tremendously infectious compared to some of the super-infectious viruses such as measles or polio, which have corresponding numbers of five to 18, but it is nevertheless enough to sustain a pandemic. The question of why we haven’t seen a worldwide pandemic of Ebola in pre-modern times therefore becomes rather perplexing. Where did it come from? A briefly popular theory of a few years ago, that the Black Death of the 14th century was caused by Ebola virus, and that the famous mediaeval descriptions of buboes were actually haemorrhagic fever blood blisters, has now been convincingly excluded by DNA analyses that have proved beyond doubt that the Black Death was, after all, bubonic plague as originally thought. Ebola may well be a purely modern disease and, since Ebola virus made its first known appearance in 1976, a whole generation of African medical workers have been drilled to be alert to the symptoms of haemorrhagic fever. Consequently, the World Health Organisation and its partners have been able to suffocate outbreaks before they spread more generally. However, the latest outbreak is proving rather more recalcitrant than expected and the story is not yet over.

                                As an enabling technology, ICT reaches into many fields including health, cybersecurity and engineering (shown here).Kevin Tong/Flickr, CC BY AUSTRALIA 2025: How will science address the challenges of the future? In collaboration with Australia’s chief scientist Ian Chubb, we’re asking how each science discipline will contribute to Australia now and in the future. Written by luminaries and accompanied by two expert commentaries to ensure a broader perspective, these articles run fortnightly and focus on each of the major scientific areas. This instalment takes a look at ICT’s role. It’s finally dawning on private and public sectors that information and communications technology (ICT) is an enabling technology. ICT is relevant to companies – whether making drugs, mining coal, building a bridge or providing banking services – and government agencies, such as the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), operators of an urban railway systems and (obviously) Social Security and Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DTSO). One or two decades ago, it was common for casual commentary to suggest that Australia had missed the ICT bus: ICT multinationals, almost all foreign-owned, generally weren’t interested in doing more than selling in Australia ICT-based small and medium enterprises (SMEs) faced the usual challenges impacting all SMEs, and the additional one – their ICT specialist R&D staff were less qualified on average than R&D staff across other disciplines CSIRO was perceived – perhaps unfairly – as not having significant impact in the area international rankings of Australian computer science publication citations showed us a long way behind even the world average. These days, public perceptions of ICT’s importance are far more developed. Almost every day, we interact with a supermarket scanner, we check our email, we pass under a motorway toll point, we download our power bill or we check what our friends on Facebook are doing. Louise Billeter/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA There is Australian software in more than a billion mobile phones worldwide. And while just a small fraction of those phones are in Australia, there are certainly enough that the community at large appreciates the transformational power of ICT and how pervasive it is, even if it is often behind the scenes. The National Broadband Network (NBN), an ICT construct if ever there was one, has been the subject of significant political controversy and raised public awareness of the pervasiveness of ICT. What’s down the track, then? Our everyday lives are going to be affected in an extraordinary number of ways, most involving the coupling of ICT ideas with technologies with which we are familiar. Likely scenarios include: instead of swallowing pills or receiving injections, devices in our body may administer drugs automatically, at times and dosage levels tuned to our body’s requirements firemen will be equipped with micro airborne vehicles to search a burning building for survivors all road vehicles will be fitted with sensors and devices to communicate with other vehicles and roadside infrastructure, to lessen collisions, and to reduce congestion through the provision of real-time advice; in due course, traffic densities on freeways will be increased through automated control of vehicles the ATO website will accept queries on curly tax issues and provide an answer via an automated service which the taxpayer can rely on in meeting his or her tax obligations partial sight will be restored through a bionic eye to people who have become blind through diseases such as macular degeneration (see video below) people will improve their qualifications through enrolment in massive open online courses (MOOCs), receiving a grade after automated processing of their assignments and examination papers many farm fences will be eliminated; farm animals will be provided with sensors designed to localise the animal’s position and deliver an electric shock when it strays from a defined region people will discuss contracts with a non-English-fluent Korean businessman using a two-way, unobtrusive real-time translation phone app, or via an add-on to a three-dimensional Skype system robot floor cleaners in the home will be as fast and as efficient as vacuum cleaners pushed by a human. This list highlights the pervasiveness of ICT applications, and no doubt countless more examples can be advanced. Almost everyone would agree too that we would be better off with such advances (though with qualifications with issues such as privacy and security). So what is involved in getting there? Arlo Bates/Flickr (cropped), CC BY-NC-SA A passive approach is to imagine that using money earned from trade in agriculture or mining or education, we could simply buy tasty ICT morsels catching our fancy in the international market. But this won’t work. We must have ICT skills: if we don’t, not only do we miss out on the pots of gold associated with the different business opportunities, but we will be ill-informed purchasers of sophisticated products. If buying internationally, we could be as much victims of a ruthless vendor as the Icelandic bankers who purchased foreign financial products that ruined their country in 2008. Imagine trying to decide what is the best technology or technologies for an NBN with little or no expertise. The required human capital clearly must come from universities, and will only be up-to-date if the universities have adequately resourced staff of international standard. Three simple steps to maximise ICT talent First, it needs to be very easy for ICT researchers to collaborate with researchers in other disciplines; so many future applications will rest on a further disciplinary pillar besides ICT, precisely because it is an enabling technology. Of course, institutional players such as the universities and the Australian Research Council (ARC) will sign on to this proposition, but giving effect to it can be still very challenging. Fundamentally, prestige for an academic grounded in his or her achievements is generally seen as easier to attain when a single discipline is involved. Those crossing two (or more) disciplines are more likely to be considered as not making it well in either rather than achieving a high standard in more than one discipline. An example of cross-disciplinary research: brain-computer interfacing. Sybren Stüvel/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND Then there’s the question of money: if discipline-based panels allocate research funds, such researchers can lose out. The second qualification is that the route to commercialisation of ideas needs to be straightforward. In the ICT area commercialisation has been hugely assisted by the creation in 2002 of NICTA. This organisation has provided a bridge not only between its own researchers and the commercial world (including business creation with start-ups) but also between affiliated ICT researchers in universities and the commercial world. Commercialisation is less the core business of universities than it is of NICTA, and most universities have less depth of ICT-relevant commercialisation skill set than NICTA has. A third requirement is that it must be possible to pursue large-scale research ideas with public sector finance. With the limited exceptions provided by Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) or ARC centres and defence-oriented work in DSTO, CSIRO and NICTA are probably the only examples. A healthy coupling of the university sector to the commercial world is certainly not the whole story. That coupling needs to be grounded in a solid disciplinary base where the individuals can match it with the best in the world. The science of cyber analytics supports better predictions and guides adaptive responses of computers and computer networks. PNNL - Pacific Northwest National Laboratory/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA Specialists are needed in subdisciplines such as cyber security, machine learning, computer and communication networking, large scale and distributed systems, mobile communications and computing and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>, to name a few. But without our ICT experts, we’ll be left behind the wayside – and catching up will be more difficult than ever. David Glance, Associate Professor at the University of Western Australia It is easy to confuse Australia’s passion for being users of the latest technology with a passion to be involved in creating them. In fact, as the US continues to see a rise in enrolments in computer science degrees, Australia has seen a continuous decline. It is not that Australians are less bright or resourceful or less hard working. It is not even a tyranny of distance because if there is one thing you can do remotely, it is develop and sell technology, especially software. No – it may simply be the fact that on the whole, Australians are just not interested in developing ICT. This is not a particular problem in a globalised world in which the ways of doing things in Australia are not that different to how things are done in the US or in Europe. We can possibly rely on others to produce the technologies that we will need to drive a growing economy past the mining phase. What will be vital as a minimum, though, will be the ability and desire to utilise ICT to support innovation in everything else that we actually do. So even if being a primary provider of ICT is not in Australia’s future, being expert at using them will be. Toby Walsh, Research Leader at NICTA Paul Goyette/Flickr (cropped), CC BY-NC-SA ICT has been a great driver for change over the past 10 years – and, as illustrated by Brian’s examples above, it is sure to continue being one of the most important drivers over the next decade. So let’s not forget the immense environmental, societal as well as economic pressures that are building across the globe. Australia, the lucky country, has escaped many of the troubles so far, but our luck can only last so long, and ICT is one of the few hopes we have to mitigate the problems that lie ahead. We already work closely with our mathematician colleagues to develop equations to help government and business optimise their activities, and do more with less. It’s computers that ultimately solve these problems. As the recent debate over tax bills of multinationals demonstrate, nations must produce – not consume – intellectual property in the ICT space to reap the rewards. Take Google, for example. Google sits on around US$60 billion – not bad for a company founded on the back of a computer algorithm. But those rewards don’t go to the users of Google. They flow back to the producers. For this reason, Australia must produce ICT to ride the coming wave of change.

                                Tesla may already be reaping the rewards of freeing up its patents. Four days after CEO <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> offered most of his company’s patents to rivals in hopes of cultivating a bigger electric car market, Nissan and BMW are “keen on talks” to cooperate on charging networks, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. That pretty much validates why the Silicon Valley company freed up its patents in the first place: Tesla wants its superchargers to become the industry standard. That way, other companies will use and enlarge Tesla's existing network of 97 charging stations that currently dot a path

                                Every once in a while a company comes along that completely changes the world. Google is one such company, making the Internet accessible and meaningful to billions of people. So is Facebook, which increasingly connects those billions of people. And then there's Apple, which has set the standard for what is possible with mobile devices. Still, it's too bad Apple can't be more like Tesla, the electric car company founded by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>. Because Tesla, unlike Apple, is determined to share its innovations. Opening Up Innovation Up until this past week, Tesla was much like Apple. It sought and hoarded patents, proudly displaying its patents on the wall of its Palo Alto headquarters. But last Thursday, Tesla made a bold move: it open sourced its patents. Every single one of them. The reason? As Musk opined on the company's blog, sharing innovation is better than stockpiling and suing over it: Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal. Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology. Nor is this some unselfish act whereby Musk plays the part of global benefactor to others' innovation at the expense of his balance sheet: At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla. We couldn’t have been more wrong. The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn’t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.... Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day. In other words, competitors haven't caught up. They're hardly in the game, and for Tesla to truly grow, it needs a vibrant, competitive market in which to build and sell its cars. A consumer that starts with a low-end competitor is more likely to then upgrade to Tesla's premium brand. Hence, as he stresses, the market would benefit, "from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform." As for concerns over losing Tesla's edge, Musk quashes that notion: Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers. We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard. It's a brilliant strategic move and it's one that would be unfathomable a few miles south in Apple's Cupertino. The Mobile Patent Quagmire Mobile computing has been a morass of patent suits and countersuits for years, nicely summarized by PC Mag's infographic. With so much money at stake, the reasoning goes, of course companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft would engage in IP jockeying to lock in their share. And, boy, have they ever. Apple, in particular, has been an active instigator of such suits, and has filed more than 350 cases with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office since January 2008. Steve Jobs was the heart and soul of Apple and he once famously accused Google of "grand theft" over Google's Android operating system and threatened that he was "willing to go to thermonuclear war on this." Which is exactly what we've seen. While Apple and Google's former manufacturing arm Motorola thawed the mobile patent warfare in March, agreeing to drop the suits they'd launched against each other, years were lost while Apple and its competitors fought each other in court.  Since the launch of the original iPhone, we've seen different screen sizes, more memory, faster chips and sharper resolution, all resulting in fat profits. But real, groundbreaking innovation equal to Apple's original touchscreen? Not so much. In fact, in 2013 reports surfaced that Apple's board was concerned by Apple's slowed pace of innovation.  There's a very valid argument that Apple doesn't need to constantly introduce new products, given how much it earns from existing products. Such earnings are fueled, in part, by the patent-encrusted moat Apple uses to defend its profits. No one can look at Apple's balance sheet and credibly call it a failure. Innovation Is The Best Protection Apple should not be lauded for resting on its patented laurels. As Musk noted last week, "If a company is truly relying on patents it means they aren't innovating, or not innovating fast enough. You want to be innovating so fast [that] you invalidate your prior patents."  Tesla is doing this. Apple could, too. Apple regularly wows the world with beautiful, brilliant products. Imagine the innovation we might have seen these past few years if Apple were forcing itself and the entire industry to look forward to new developments rather than constantly cashing in on old achievements. It could be advancing the mobile industry far faster while still plumping its bank balance if it, too, opened up its innovations as Tesla has done. Tesla's decision to open its patents isn't dissimilar from what the open-source software world does. Years ago Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst pointed out that open source business models align customer and vendor interests by forcing vendors to "innovate or die." In the open-source world, customers only pay for subscriptions when software is constantly being improved. They only pay when their vendors deliver real value. That may be a scary proposition for Apple, but given its culture of innovation, it is one Cupertino should welcome.

                                THE author of “Fifty Shades of Grey”, E.L. James, has mused at length about a billionaire inflicting punishment in her bondage-based bestseller. As the recipient of one of the first right-hand-drive versions of the Tesla Model S to hit Britain’s roads, personally handed to her at an event in London last week by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>, the carmaker’s wealthy boss, she is clearly attuned to billionaires dishing out pleasure too. The “range anxiety” that afflicts other electric-car owners has been minimised in the Model S by packing it with lots of batteries; the agony-inducing cost of filling up at the petrol station need never bother Ms James again.Other all-electric cars, costly and with limited ranges, have proved a hard sell. The models from most mainstream carmakers still look and feel like gimmicks. Tesla’s main achievement is producing a car which can be judged credibly alongside any fast and expensive petrol-propelled saloon. But the Californian company’s long-term growth prospects, and the widespread adoption of electric cars, are both dependent on a big drop in battery costs. Tesla’s next mission, to begin making a cheaper, mass-market electric vehicle...

                                MEDIOBANCA was founded in 1946 with an explicit mission to rebuild Italian industry in the aftermath of the second world war. The result was a web of cross-shareholdings and pacts among big shareholders, with the Milanese investment bank at its centre, which allowed a narrow elite to control many of the country’s biggest businesses for decades. So the announcement last year that Mediobanca would exit these pacts and focus on its core business constituted a dramatic reversal. What with a similar move by Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer, the web is beginning to look a little tattered (see chart).Mediobanca has sold €800m ($1.1 billion) of equities over the past nine months, half of its three-year goal. Both it and Generali say they will exit the pact that controls Telecom Italia this month, and eventually sell their shares. Privatisation is also changing things. The government is selling part of Fincantieri, one of Europe’s biggest shipbuilders, this month; Poste Italiane, the postal service, will probably be next. Many privately held firms plan offerings too, led by Cerved, a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>-services company.

                                In December, India's Supreme Court overturned a lower court's previous decision that had decriminalized homosexuality. The top court's ruling declared same-sex intercourse and marriage illegal again, ending a four-year period of gay freedom.  At the time, human rights groups issued statements quibbling with the ruling. The Lawyers Collective, the legal group that advanced the case, called it "a major setback to LGBT rights," while Anjali Gopalan of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>-focused Naz Foundation called it "a black day," adding, "We are being set back by 100 years."

                                EXUBERANCE about both “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” and Twitter has of late given way to a degree of scepticism among commentators. Yet Dataminr, a New York startup that analyses the 500m or so tweets sent out daily, goes from strength to strength. Founded in 2009 to scour the Twittersphere for important events and news not yet reported by the mainstream media, the firm now has dozens of customers in finance, the news business and the public sector. In January it and Twitter struck a deal to provide alerts to CNN. In April its tracking of tweets was part of a strategy by the authorities in Boston to avoid a repeat of last year’s terrorist attack at the city’s annual marathon.Dataminr scores every tweet using about 30 indicators of significance, says Ted Bailey, who launched the firm with two former Yale roommates. Dataminr started out seeking market-sensitive information for investors. It now supplies around 50 financial firms. Then came various arms of government; Mr Bailey claims ten clients, though he will name only the city of Boston.Sorting out the signal from the Twitter noise is not easy. How to tell which tweeters are on to something, and which are just twits? Is there a clue in their language, or their location? Can a false positive be spotted fast enough?Much of Dataminr’s early work involved tracing back stories that proved genuine, and market-moving events, to find their earliest...

                                ON MAY 1st 2007 John Browne resigned as boss of BP, a British oil giant, his career apparently in ruins. A tabloid newspaper had exposed his affair with a male ex-prostitute. For the next few weeks Lord Browne was subjected to one of those trials by media at which the British excel. Three years later the Deepwater Horizon disaster, an explosion that led to the leakage of millions of gallons of oil off America’s Gulf coast, suggested that there might have been more serious reasons than his private sexual preferences to question Lord Browne’s tenure at BP. The disaster seemed to confirm both the worries of some analysts that he had sacrificed investment in a dash for growth, and environmentalists’ accusations that his rebranding of BP as Beyond Petroleum was just superficial “greenwashing”.Despite all the blows to his reputation, Lord Browne has done a remarkable job of reviving his career. He has built Riverstone Holdings, a private-equity company, into a powerful force in European <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>.
