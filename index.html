                                Good morning! Here's what you need to know. 1.  Here Comes Putin. Russia says it is preparing retaliatory measures in response to new U.S. and E.U. sanctions. One measure reportedly under consideration would be to block sections of Russian airspace for Western flights, though Moscow has denied that that is on the table, according the Wall Street Journal's Gregory White. Russia has also amassed 20,000 troops on the Ukrainian border in response to what it says is a pending humanitarian disaster in Eastern Ukraine.  2.  Fox Ends Time Warner Bid. Rupert Murdoch will no longer pursue the cable giant. Henry Blodget talked to insiders who explained why: Time Warner's board and management demonstrated zero interest, while Fox shares themselves had dropped significantly once the bid leaked. Instead Fox announced a share buyback after the bell Tuesday. Fox shares are up more than 7% before the bell, while Time Warner's are down 10%. Fox and Time Warner both post earnings today. 3.  Tesla Resolves China Trademark Spat. Zhan Baoshang, a Chinese national, had previously claimed copyright on "Tesla." Reuters' Samuel Shen and Norihiko Shirouzu report the settlement "[removes] a hurdle that had threatened CEO <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>'s ambition to expand rapidly in the world's biggest auto market." Tesla recently announced it was planning to open 100 service stations in China. 4.  Troubled Tech Stocks. Shares in First Solar, Zillow and Groupon were all down significantly Wednesday after each reported problematic earnings after the bell Tuesday. First Solar's profits fell to $4.5 million from $33.6 million on project delays; Groupon announced revenues of $751.6 million, well short of the $762 million expected by analysts. Zillow said its adjusted Q2 loss per share came in at $0.05 versus earnings of $0.01 a year earlier.  5.  Walgreens Buys Alliance Boots. The Chicago-based pharma retailer is buying out the remaining 55% of the European pharma retailer. Its headquarters will remain in Chicago and the firm insists it will not attempt a tax inversion, the AP says.  6.  Trade. Our only major datapoint for Wednesday is the U.S. trade balance. Consensus is for a reading of -$45 billion versus -$44.4 billion prior. "The headline deficit should be little changed at $44.5B, with slightly better core numbers and a modest increase in the aircraft surplus offset by a temporary price-induced jump in the oil deficit," Pantheon Macro's Ian Shepherdson said in a note.  7.  Italy In Recession. The Italian economy contracted 0.2% in Q2, following a negative 0.1% reading in the prior quarter. The recent reading was Italy's worst Q2 performance since 2000. Germany's two-year bond yield went to zero on the news.   8. Russian Hackers Steal 1.2 Billion Passwords. The login credentials were scraped from 420,000 different websites, "including household names," the New York Times' Nicole Perlroth and David Gelles report. “Companies that rely on user names and passwords have to develop a sense of urgency about changing this,” said Avivah Litan, a security analyst at the research firm Gartner. “Until they do, criminals will just keep stockpiling people’s credentials.”    9.  Earnings. This morning we get the aforementioned AOL, Chesapeake, Molson, Mondelez, Ralph Lauren, Time Warner, and Viacom. After the bell we get the aforementioned Fox. 10.  Markets. Everything is tanking on weaker Europe data and Russia jitters among other things. U.S. futures are off 0.5%. London's FTSE was off 1.1%, Germany's DAX was down 1.6%, France's CAC40 fell 1.3%. Japan's Nikkei was down 1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was off 0.3%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.1%.  Join the conversation about this story »

                                The International Air Transport Association said it was still optimistic the industry would report improved profits this year although highlighted risks from conflict and the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak as possible obstacles. IATA, which represents around 240 airlines, said on Wednesday passenger traffic demand in June had slowed to growth of 4.7 percent, compared with 6.2 percent for May. "Earlier signs of a softening in demand are dissipating," IATA Director General Tony Tyler said in a statement, describing the June figures as encouraging. "While that's good news there are many risks in the political and economic environment that need careful monitoring," he said, highlighting conflict in the Middle East, an impending trade war with Russia, possible default in Argentina or the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in west Africa as situations that could hurt demand for air travel.

                                ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria's health minister says a nurse died of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> and the country has five additional confirmed cases of the disease. Onyebuchi Chukwu said Wednesday that all the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> cases are being treated in isolation in Lagos, sub-Saharan Africa's largest city with 21 million people. He said the nurse had treated the man who traveled from Liberia and died of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in Lagos last month. The five other confirmed cases are believed to be health workers who treated Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer who was sick when he flew into Lagos and died days later on July 25.

                                Good morning! Here's what people will be chatting about on Wednesday.  1. The World Health Organization is holding a two-day emergency meeting in Geneva to discuss the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic in West Africa. Summit members will determine whether the disease outbreak is a "public health emergency of international concern," the United Nations said in a statement. The outcome will be announced at a press conference on Friday, Aug. 8.  2. A Russian hacker group stole 1.2 billion usernames and passwords, a U.S. security firm has said. The New York Times, which first reported the findings, described the breach as the "largest known collection of stolen Internet credentials." 3. Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox withdrew a $71 billion bid for Time Warner. Time Warner rejected Fox's initial offer made in June. Speaking to the FT, a source close to the company said no future deal would be made.  4. A high-ranking Army officer, Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene, was killed by an Afghan solider in an attack on a military training academy on Tuesday. General Greene was "an engineer by training whose missions usually did not involve guns and grenades," The New York Times wrote. "His goal was to integrate smartphones, video conferences and even virtual worlds into a military culture that often prized hardware rather than software." 5. The first television debate between the leaders of the "yes" and "no" campaigns over Scottish independence — Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling — was held on Tuesday night. According to a Guardian poll, Salmond, the Scottish National Party chief arguing for Scottish independence, lost the live debate to Alistair Darling, the leader of the Better Together campaign.  6. In an interview with the BBC, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. "stands squarely behind Israel's right" to defend itself against rocket attacks. "I believe that the situation now that has evolved will concentrate people's minds on the need to get back to the negotiation and try and resolve the issues of the two states," Kerry added.   7. New York State's financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, is discussing a possible settlement with British bank Standard Chartered over allegations that the bank failed "to detect transactions vulnerable to money laundering," The New York Times said, citing people familiar with the matter. In 2012, Standard Chartered was fined $340 million by the same regulator for money-laundering violations.  8. Apple and Samsung announced they have settled all patent disputes over smartphones and tablets outside the U.S. In a joint statement, the two companies said: "This agreement does not involve any licensing arrangements, and the companies are continuing to pursue the existing cases in U.S. courts." 9. A new study about the effects of aspirin says the drug "could dramatically cut people's chances of getting and dying from common cancers," the Guardian said. A team from Queen Mary University of London concluded that taking a low-dose of aspirin everyday for at least 5 years could reduce the risk of certain cancers, but warns that it could increase the risk of stomach bleeds.  10. The Rosetta spacecraft is about to become the first-ever probe to orbit around and land on a comet. The spacecraft, operated by the European Space Agency, has been on a 10-year, 4 billion mile journey through space.  And finally... Are you a narcissist? A new study from researchers at Ohio University has determined that one simple question can identify this group of people.   Join the conversation about this story »

                                Sophisticated and terrifying: Israeli firepower.EPA/Atef Safadi In the 1982 Lebanon war I served as an Israeli artillery forward observer, my task to pinpoint the PLO’s positions and call in fire from our artillery units. We stayed in the evacuated Al Jamous School, overlooking Beirut. The routine was simple enough: I would pop into the classroom next door from where I would collect the co-ordinates and description of my military targets: “a military camp”, “a mortar”, “an antenna”. I would then return to my room and, looking out of the windows, I would direct our fire on the targets. From time to time I would pause to let the air force get in to drop its munitions; and the navy would fire from the sea. Beirut, in the summer of 1982, was all burning up – a city on fire. There was a purpose to this massive bombardment: to hit Yasser Arafat’s guerrilla force and its weapons – and also put pressure on the Lebanese, particularly those living inside Beirut with no water, food and electricity, so they demanded Arafat get out of Beirut which would then stop our assault. In the end, a Lebanese military officer by the name of Jonny Abdu confronted Arafat who left Lebanon and moved to Tunisa. Looking back now, I’m appalled by our brutal bombing of Beirut. Was it justified to turn this beautiful city into a Middle Eastern Dresden and kill hundreds of innocent civilians in the process? Now to Gaza where, like in 1982 Beirut, the Israeli army is using overwhelming military power to locate and destroy Hamas’s tunnels, to stop them firing rockets into Israel – and also to put pressure on the Gazans (as we had pressured the Beirutis) so they turn their backs on Hamas as a political force. In the process, just as in Lebanon, hundreds of innocent Palestinians have been killed and parts of Gaza, as some sections of 1982 Beirut, have been turned into wastelands. Even worst, UN schools in Gaza which are shelters to more than 250,000 refugees, and their hospitals have also been hit by Israeli artillery and bombs. Wayward artillery Can anything be done so that in the next round between Israel and Hamas, which is inevitable, there would be fewer innocent civilian casualties? The answer to this question is yes. It is indeed possible to reduce the number of casualties on the Palestinian side, but this would require a modification of the Israeli army’s rules of engagement, namely the way it operates, particularly when in close proximity to schools, hospitals and other shelters. On the receiving end. EPA/Mohammed Saber For example, as an artillery officer I know that even now – with advanced technologies – artillery fire is unreliable. As an artillery forward observer, I always looked up to the sky, praying my shells hit the targets and not land on my head. Artillery shells have a strange habit of going astray. In 1996, in southern Lebanon, wayward Israeli artillery shells landed on a UN compound near the village of Qana, killing 106 innocent people. In the current Gaza war many of the innocent casualties were victims of artillery shells landing in the wrong place. What’s needed here is to ensure that heavy artillery is not used in Gaza’s urban areas – particularly not near schools and hospitals. As for Israeli attacks from the air, at the moment, Israeli pilots, or those who dispatch them, can choose from a range of bombs weighing from 250-1,000kg. They often opt for the latter, as they are big enough to destroy the target completely – and the pilots are confident they can hit the target accurately, as they often do. The problem is that the collateral damage of such big bombs is catastrophic in densely populated Gaza; it destroys not only the intended targets but also causes massive damage to nearby structures and kills non-combatants. Such big bombs must be banned altogether from being used in the vicinity of shelters, schools and hospitals. Hannibal Protocol Finally, certain practices employed by the Israeli army should not be allowed to be used, most notably the “Hannibal Protocol”, which is the IDF’s procedure for preventing soldiers from falling into enemy hands. The Hannibal Protocol is yet another product of Israel’s Lebanon wars: a procedure to be used in the first minutes and hours after a possible abduction of an Israeli soldier. It calls on the military to dramatically escalate attacks in the vicinity of any kidnapping – to strike at bridges, roads, houses, cars – everything, in fact, to prevent the captors from disappearing with the abducted soldier. When the IDF thought – wrongly as it turned out - that one of its officers had been abducted by Hamas in the southern Gaza Strip, the Hannibal protocol was activated to a most devastating effect. The army used everything at its disposal – tanks, artillery, aeroplanes, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> – and pounded vast areas in Rafah, causing enormous damage, killing and wounding scores of innocent Palestinians. The brutal Hannibal procedure seems to me to break all rules of war. It should be thrown out of the window and never used again in Gaza. What will ultimately stop the death of innocent Palestinians and Israelis is a peace deal putting an end to the conflict. But in the meantime, a modification of the Israeli rules of engagement could reduce the number of innocent casualties. In 2010, following Israel’s Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip which resulted in hundreds of Palestinian casualties, the IDF produced a document calling on military commanders, operating in densely populated areas, to “exercise judgement and use more accurate weapons, or lower-impact weapons”. It seems, judging from the sheer number of Palestinian casualties in the current Gaza war, that the Israelis are not following their own rules – or the rules were produced at the time as a PR exercise to silence international criticism. There’s no reason to think the Israelis couldn’t change their rules, though. We have international conventions banning, for instance, the use of chemical weapons in war, so it is possible, I believe, to also prohibit the use of heavy artillery, big bombs and cruel procedures in densely populated areas such as the Gaza Strip. After all, it is also in Israel’s interest, as the horrific pictures coming out of the Gaza Strip ruin the country’s already tarnished reputation.

                                Roll up.Katling, CC BY-NC-SA Hollywood makes films that excite and exhilarate; films that make us laugh, cry, connect with humanity – and above all make box office bucks along the way. While most of us would happily say we were going to see an action movie, what about the latest health flick? Three years ago we began compiling a list of health-themed films that could help teach medical students. Our initial criteria was that any film should have a minimum tomatometer rating of 70% on online rating website Rotten Tomatoes. From an initial list of 15, we now now have 32 recommended films that students choose from to review and present in class. Here’s a short list of some of my favourites: 1. Contagion (2011) Let’s get outta here. Alphab.fr, CC BY A star-studded cast battle to contain a new deadly virus. The film tackles the issue of how health officials and doctors respond to a pandemic but also the ethics around how scarce resources could be allocated in a time of crisis. While the virus wasn’t real, the portrayal of the health professional response to pandemic was realistic. The fear of deadly viruses is never very far away in the public imagination – take the current <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus outbreak in West Africa. To plan well for something like this covers policymakers, drug makers, pathologists and a sense of social responsibility from everyone. Tomatometer rating: 84%. Box office takings: US$135.4m 2. Sicko (2007) Moore insurance needed. Shannon Kringen, CC BY Filmmaker Michael Moore’s documentary on the US healthcare system was an eye-opener, detailing the politics of providing healthcare and the tension between personal and governmental responsibility for health. It also covers the influence that multinational corporations (in this case insurance and pharmaceutical companies) have on the health choices people make. Ultimately, Moore takes a critical stance of the system in the US and the its failure to cover its citizens – he found nearly 50m Americans with no health cover at all. Heated political fighting over president Barack Obama’s introduction of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which aimed to make health insurance more affordable shows just how live the issue still is. Tomatometer rating: 92%. Box office takings: US$36m 3. Milk (2008) Milk and White completely incompatible. CC BY-NC Directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Sean Penn as the eponymous Harvey Milk. In 1977 Milk became the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in the US before he was assassinated – by a resentful Dan White (played by Josh Brolin) – the following year. The film earned eight nominations and two Oscars and takes on issues around sexual orientation and prejudice but also about society and later ignorance around an emerging disease: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDs">AIDs</a></span>. Tomatometer rating: 94%. Box office takings: US$54.5m 4. Super-Size Me (2004) Fries in the face of logic. Gauravonomics, CC BY What happens when one man exclusively eats McDonald’s for one month? Plenty of food for thought with this one … Tomatometer rating: 93%. Box office takings: US$20.6m 5. Amazing Grace (2006) A modern take. Mr Stacey, CC BY-NC The movies that provoke the most discussion among our students – the litmus test for educational value – are not necessarily what you may expect. Not strictly a health film, granted, but with modern health implications. Abolitionist William Wilberforce’s life’s mission to abolish slavery is akin to the contemporary challenge of persuading politicians, faced with a strong tobacco lobby, of the financial as well as health benefits of a smoke free country. Tomatometer rating: 70%. Box office takings: US$32m There are many more that could be added to the list. The most recent to be considered is The Dallas Buyer’s Club (2014), the true story of Ron Woodroof, a Texan who hustled the system to get medication to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> patients in the 1980s after he himself was diagnosed. Our next move is to build up a list that covers psychiatry in the movies – and there will certainly be some rich material here.

                                Is the sun setting on West African oil? A platform in Limbe, CameroonVirginieVV, CC BY After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the US made a point of diversifying its sources of oil to reduce dependence on the Middle East. It was a strategic move which promised a huge boost to West African oil exporters around the Gulf of Guinea, but those same countries now face the comedown as the rise and rise of US domestic <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> whisks the opportunity away so quickly after it arrived. It had all the trappings of a gold rush. Nigeria, Angola, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea in particular were identified as attractive sources of oil and therefore destined to become increasingly important to the post-9/11 US energy strategy. West African crude is of high quality, the region was perceived as less hostile to US interests than the Middle East, and the Atlantic Ocean waterways are a more secure shipping corridor compared to those in the Persian Gulf. A 2001 National Energy Policy Report, often referred to as the “Cheney Report” as it was chaired by the then US vice president, identified energy security as a top US trade and foreign policy priority. A wide range of industry experts and commentators predicted that 25% of all US oil imports would come from West Africa, thus expanding the US’ presence in the region. The establishment of the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) in 2007 was considered a manifestation of the “securitisation” of Africa, relating not only to the US-led war on terror but also to the need for the US to secure energy supplies. And US oil imports from its six key suppliers in sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) increased by 40% from 2001 to 2010, whereas total US oil imports increased by only 16%. In the past few years, however, we have seen a rapid increase in US <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil production, a revolution in energy production with major implications for the global energy trade. This has fundamentally upended widely held assumptions about both the future of US energy imports and the role of West African petro-states in supplying them. The question now is not whether the US will depend on West Africa for a quarter of its (diminishing) oil imports, but whether it will be importing West African oil at all. By 2012, US oil imports from sub-Saharan Africa had declined by 59% from peaks only a few years earlier, compared to a less drastic 23% decline in overall US oil imports. Nowhere is this rapid shift felt more acutely than in Nigeria. In three years alone US crude oil imports from Nigeria have decreased by 75%, from nearly 359m barrels in 2010 to 87m in 2013. Based on the US Energy Information Agency’s figures for the first quarter of 2014, US imports will drop by another 75% this year alone to about 22m barrels. Edward Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup Global Markets, predicts that the US and Canada will completely cease importing crude oil from West Africa some time this year. Nigerian oil minister Diezani Kogbeni Alison-Madueke speaks at an OPEC meeting in 2013. Herbert Neubauer/EPA Nigeria is an instructive case study for thinking about how the shale revolution will impact developing states dependent on energy export revenues, in West Africa and elsewhere. There is great concern in Nigeria about the rapidly dwindling US export market, which has been by far the most important destination for Nigerian oil. Nigeria’s oil minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke, identifies US shale oil as “one of the most serious threats” to Africa’s oil exporters as Nigerian oil is now being displaced by abundant and cheap US shale oil and increasing US imports from Canada. The loss of Nigeria’s most important export market is compounded by the ongoing troubles surrounding the country’s domestic production. Exploration for customers Oil theft, sabotage of infrastructure and the general corruption and social conflict that have arisen in the wake of Nigeria’s oil boom are now resulting in international oil companies pulling back from the country. Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have begun to divest themselves from higher risk onshore and shallow water oil fields, with Nigerian and emerging market (in particular Chinese) national oil companies stepping in to fill the gaps. Nigeria and other producers in the region will reorient exports to the EU and Asia. However, these markets, too, will eventually be affected by US production. And the EU is hardly a long-term prospect for West African oil given its move towards cleaner fuels such as renewables and also lower overall energy consumption. With the potential of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil to significantly increase production in other parts of the world, such as China, Argentina, South Africa and the UK, there will likely be increasing insecurity and volatility ahead for producers of conventional oil. In particular the petro-states of West Africa who are highly dependent on oil export revenues and are perhaps least equipped to deal with unpredictable revenue flows and the costs of reorienting their export markets. Oil and gas will remain crucial resources for financing development in an increasing number of African states, but as the “oil curse” has proven, high risk remains ever present.

                                Photos like this are doing more harm than good to wildlife. eric molina/Flickr, CC BY You might have noticed recently that a plague of “selfies” with tigers appears to have overtaken mobile dating app Tinder (where users “swipe right” to indicate interest; left to reject). Globally, so many male Tinder profiles include tigers that there are blogs dedicated to them. But involving tigers in human courtship isn’t without consequences. A recent campaign from Care for the Wild International stresses that tiger selfies place humans and wildlife at risk. When it comes to taking photos with wildlife, tigers are just the tip of the iceberg. Having a photo with an exotic or wild animal may seem harmless, but it can pose a threat to the animal, person and potentially a whole species. Ethical problems A different sort of tiger selfie: in the past tigers were more valuable dead than alive. Wikimedia Commons There are ethical concerns about having photos taken with tigers. Big cat cubs and primates continue to be used as props for photos with tourists, particularly in south-east Asia, where the animals may be drugged, chained up or have teeth and claws (for cats) removed to prevent injury to people. Photos with tiger cubs can also be taken at travelling and roadside zoos and petting displays in malls in the United States. When big cats or primates are fully grown, they are often unmanageable, and may end up locked up in basements, cages or in private zoos. All tiger subspecies are endangered, with fewer than 3200 adults left in the wild (although estimates vary). Today there are more tigers in captivity than in the wild. Fuelling trade If users of dating apps set a popular trend of profile photos with tigers or other rare and exotic species, demand for similar photos may result in unscrupulous businesses breeding animals indiscriminately or poaching them from the wild. Capture of endangered slow lorises for use as photo props and pets has increased as a result of videos posted on YouTube, with illegal trade increasing the species risk of extinction. After removing their teeth to avoid injury to people, these animals can never be returned to the wild. Studies have shown that people who see images of chimpanzees in popular media are more likely to think that chimpanzees aren’t threatened, and that they make good pets. In fact chimpanzees are endangered; and adults are large and stronger than humans, and make terrible pets. Animals in the wild For years, wildlife tourists have been encouraged to “take only photographs, leave only footprints” but photos of tourists interacting with wildlife may fuel unrealistic expectations of “close encounters”. International tourists seek intensely close interactions with large wild animals: swimming with orcas in Norway; cage diving with great white sharks in Australia; or trekking large mammals on land. In the excitement of the moment, tourists may put themselves and animals at risk of injury and disease. International tourist revenues have formed the backbone of national economies, have built schools and clinics, and have saved natural habitat. However, close encounters with wildlife are associated with a number of problems and threats to health of wildlife, humans and the environment. The UK registered charity “Care for the Wild International" highlights the potential negative impacts that interactions between tourists and wildlife may have on people, wildlife and natural habitats. Best-practice guidelines stipulate minimum “buffer” distances between people and wildlife, such as tourists keeping a distance of seven metres from mountain gorillas in Rwanda or Uganda to keep them free from human diseases and stress. Gorillas are highly susceptible to human diseases For some species, such as tigers in India, a fleeting glimpse from a distance may be all that a tourist is likely to get, which may lead to disappointment and damage to future tourism through poor visitor satisfaction. Photos suggest otherwise: a close up, one on one experience. In reality, there may be hundreds of other tourists leading to a less “intimate” experience. You might be one of hundreds of tourists seeking a tiger Selfies to death Apart from the potential suffering and abuse for animals used as photo props, close encounters can be a threat to people. Tigers can be dangerous and kill or maim humans in natural habitats and in captivity every year. Once tourist sites and humans become associated with food, wild animals may lurk around bins, camp sites and tourist spots. Whether in Gibraltar, India, Malaysia or Japan, overly aggressive monkeys beg and snatch for food that makes them fat and unhealthy (monkeys fed by tourists on Gibraltar in the past were called “bags of fat”). The quest for the perfect photo opportunity or memorable close encounter, without understanding the animals’ behavioural repertoire or signs of aggression and stress, increases potential risk of injury to tourists, particularly if the wild animals are overly habituated, losing all fear of humans. Close encounters also risk transmitting disease from animals to people, including diseases from monkeys in south east Asia and recently from camels in the Midde East. Many emerging infectious diseases, known as “zoonoses”, have come from animals, including <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, “bird flu”, and SARS. The way we portray animals in wildlife selfies gives rise to all sorts of misperceptions that might inadvertently be pushing the animals that we consider special towards extinction. Therefore, when you see a potential date cuddling a tiger, I urge you to swipe left.

                                While the panic over American <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients being treated in Atlanta is unfounded, there is a very real and devastating crisis going on in West Africa, as the largest <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in history tears through rural villages, towns, and — for the first time ever — major cities, which are overcrowded and ill-prepared. Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea — the trio of countries at the center of the outbreak — are poor and decentralized, with scant health care resources to help contain the much-feared disease, which kills the majority of people infected. At last count, there were 1,603 suspected and confirmed cases and 887 deaths. In a must-read piece for The New Yorker, Richard Preston, author of The Hot Zone, describes the harrowing situation on the ground in Sierra Leone, which currently has the highest number of suspected cases, 646. Daniel Bausch, a Tulane University doctor and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> expert, tells Preston about the scene inside an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> ward he helped set up, "a cluster of small cinder-block buildings" where the facility's director, Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, and a single nurse were caring for 30 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients when he arrived. "The floor was splashed with blood, vomitus, feces, and urine," Bausch told Preston, explaining that sickened patients have trouble staying in bed. "You need a whole team to decontaminate the bed and lift the patient up off the floor and put him safely back in bed." Anyone who comes close to the patients must wear stuffy and cumbersome biohazard suits; the temperature inside them can reportedly rise to dangerous levels. The nurses were overwhelmed and underpaid.  They were "working twelve hour days... [and] were supposed to be earning an extra thirty dollars a week in hazard pay," Preston writes. "But the government of Sierra Leone had not provided it. Not unreasonably, many nurses had stopped showing up." Joseph Fair, another American <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> expert, traveled to Kenema to help with the mounting crisis, Preston reports. He was very close with Khan, the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> facility's director; Mbalu Sankoh, its chief nurse; and Alex Moigboi, another senior nurse. Ten days after Fair's arrival, Sankoh was dead. A fever she suspected was malaria may have actually been <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>. Moigboi, too, died soon after, and later Khan, who died in a bed inside the facility he had run for a decade. "For weeks," Preston writes, "Dr. Fair has been going to funerals in Kenema," as a growing number of the region's most devoted healthcare workers have died. Now, Fair says, there is "a huge void." Elsewhere in the region, hundreds of healthcare professionals from all over the world are working around the clock, as Nicky Woolf details in The Guardian. Doctors and nurses routinely work 15–16 hour days, seven days a week. William Fischer, a North Carolina doctor, sent "a brief email to friends and family that said 'I love you all'" before heading into the center of the outbreak, on "marching orders from the World Health Organization." "It gets emotionally taxing," he tells Woolf. Monia Sayah, a Brooklyn-based nurse with Doctors Without Borders, was deployed to Guinea treat the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients and describes to Woolf some rare moments of celebration, when a patient recovers and "the people cleaning the floors, people who do the laundry for us... the nurse, the doctor — everyone is so happy." But in an outbreak where survivors are in the minority, those moments are not the norm. Patients know how bad their odds are once they are sick. "You can see the fear, the desperation when they look at us," Sayah tells Woolf. "They hold your hand and don't want to let go."

                                The human version of nocturnal shutdowns has absolutely nothing on plants. When we sleep, our bodies continue doing a lot of the functions they do when we're awake. But when darkness sets in over the plant kingdom, at least the very large portion that derives its energy from sunlight, it's like an off-switch: no germination, flowering, growing, food production, or even aging. Nothing, and no arguments.  Once the sun comes back out, signals within the plant get the whole process started again, hopefully persisting for long enough to keep that plant alive and, crucially, completing its reproductive tasks. This on/off cycle traces back to molecules called phytochromes, which detect light and send along the various chemical signals that tell plants to wake up. That the manipulation of this molecule is of great interest to botanists should come as no surprise, and the phytochrome protein was first purified some three decades ago.  Now, the same researcher behind that initial work, the University of Wisconsin's Richard Vierstra, has fully described the crystalline structure of the actual photosensing element. The new paper is published in the June 30 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. You can already see the potential for agriculture and, in particular, the study highlights the potential for increasing the density of farm plots. "It's the molecule that tells plants when to flower," says Vierstra in a UW statement. "Plants use the molecule to sense where they are in the canopy; they use the phytochromes for color vision—to sense whether they are above, next to or under other plants." When plants sense that they're under a canopy, shaded by the leaves of neighboring plants, they stop flowering, instead expending energy on new stalks and stems rather than fruits and seeds. For phytochromes, it's not simply a matter of telling the difference between light and no light; the task is differentiating between the red light of full sun and the far-red bandwidths of the "leftover" light one finds underneath a canopy, while communicating to the rest of the plant whether or not it should be in either an active or passive mode.  The red light-detecting portion of the phytochrome was described in a 2010 paper from researchers at Brookhaven labs, but we now have the full picture, including far-red, which means being able to trace how the structure changes its signals in response to changes in light conditions. "Photoconversion between the active and inactive states of phytochromes is arguably the most important twitch on this planet, as it tells plants to become photosynthetic and consequently make the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe," Vierstra said. "By mutating the phytochromes, we created plants that think they're in full sun, even when they're not." The potential goes beyond crop density and into the realm of growing seasons. Another recent study examined the role of phytochromes in the flowering of wheat plants, finding that the structure has potential as "an additional entry point to modify wheat flowering and to accelerate the development of wheat varieties better adapted to new and changing environments."  And of course there's the underground corn plantations of the near-future, but that has a bit more to do with relative air concentrations of carbon dioxide. Still, the future of agriculture is becoming a very strange and bafflingly productive place, even without the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> farmers.

                                As the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic spirals out of control, international relief organizations are beginning to deal with something they've rarely experienced before: The specter of defeat.  Containment strategies in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Uganda are failing, and relief workers are being challenged, and outright threatened, in ways they've never been before. "Every report I'm getting from the ground has health workers in a state of fear, and they're feeling a siege from populations who despise and loathe them," said Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations who won a Pulitzer Prize for her on-the-ground reporting on the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span> outbreak in Zaire in 1996, on a conference call this morning. "They're saying 'we are terrified, we are exhausted, we want to leave, can someone take over?'" The call was, without a doubt, the bleakest I've ever listened to about a public health emergency, and there are no clear answers answers here. Problem is, there aren't many people who can take over. Already, more than 60 healthcare workers have died from the disease, and the countries' governments haven't been very successful at shepherding their people—who have never seen the disease before, often don't speak the same language as relief workers, and don't fully grasp what's going on—to treatment facilities. That's why you have things like riots outside of health care clinics and patients making escapes from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span> quarantine centers. Healthcare workers have been called "cannibals" by protesters, and Garrett said that workers she's talked to have been accused of cutting patient's arms off and selling them on the black market. In other words, the situation is fairly out of control, and it doesn't look to be getting better anytime soon.  In fact, it's so dire that relief organizations aren't sure how much longer they can keep up the fight—most of these groups have been on the ground since March, and many have seen their colleagues die or have contracted the disease themselves.  A couple weeks ago, Doctors Without Borders, a group with one of the largest on-the-ground presences there, said its workers are on their last legs. "Doctors Without Borders is not able to cope with this much longer. We need more experts to come, we need epidemiologists, we need medical staff," Anja Wolz, an emergency coordinator with Doctors Without Borders, said in a video last month. A specific request from Motherboard about the situation on the ground was not returned by the organization. Tomorrow, the World Health Organization is looking at the situation to decide if it constitutes an "international health emergency." If it does, that'll spur drug manufacturers to start testing experimental drugs and countries to shut down their borders, among other extreme efforts. But even that designation might not help, Garrett said. WHO is running at a $1.2 billion deficit and it's not clear it has the workers, cash, or influence right now to do anything about it. So, how did we get here? Right now, the three countries where the crisis is centered have very weak governments, all emerging from recent civil wars. And without central coordination, misinformation and poor logistics have run amok. "There is a major gulf between the government and those who are being governed," CFR's African policy expert John Campbell said. "The government's writ hardly runs." That means that many people in those countries are still unaware of how <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span> is spread (through bodily fluids), what it is, and what its symptoms are. They are unaware that traditional postmortem body preparations are risky, and that the virus can be transmitted from dead people to living ones.  That's where the disconnect between the people and health care workers is coming from—people with fevers are being taken away from their homes, and then they're dying. But it's near impossible to educate a populous when it's difficult to actually reach them, and it's even tougher when the things that will save them—quarantine and body disposal by experts—goes in direct contrast to tradition. "Whatever clich you want to use, this is the worst case scenario, this is the nightmare. We don't have a strategic plan [for containing this], and there's no plan for how to stop an outbreak in a chaotic urban center like a Lagos [Nigeria] or a Durban, South Africa," Garrett said. "We're hitting the point where every single healthcare worker on the ground is exhausted, terrified, burned out. What's the plan? Where will other healthcare workers come from?" Right now, it's not clear where they'll be found, and there are no immediate plans to discuss any sort of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span> plan in Washington this week, where every African leader except those from the three ravished countries are convening. Earlier this afternoon, there were reports that Lagos has as many as eight new cases of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>. If it starts spreading through the slums, this outbreak could just be getting started.

                                There's a reason that power companies are attacking rooftop solar across the nation: They see those silicon panels as nothing short of an existential threat. As the cost of solar continues to fall, and more people opt for the distributed power offered by solar, there will be less demand for big power plants and the utilities that operate them. And one major investment giant has now released three separate reports arguing that Tesla Motors is going to help kill power companies off altogether. Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley stirred up controversy when it released a report that suggested that the increasing viability of consumer solar, paired with better battery technology—that allows people to generate, and store, their own electricity—could send the decades-old utility industry into a death spiral. Then, the firm released another one, further emphasizing the points made in the first. Now, it's tripling down on the idea with yet another report that spells out how Tesla and home solar will "disrupt" utilities. There may be a 'tipping point' that causes customers to seek an off-grid approach," the March report argued. "The more customers move to solar, the [more the] remaining utility customers' bills will rise, creating even further 'headroom' for Teslas off-grid approach. Yes, Tesla Motors, everyone's favorite electric car company. And that's where the controversy comes in. Morgan Stanley breathlessly pegged Tesla as the most important auto company in the world" in part because its electric car business was pushing it to develop better energy storage technology, and then mass manufacture said batteries. That's exactly what Tesla CEO <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> and company will be doing at its forthcoming Gigafactory, which it is building in the Southwest with Panasonic.  With the new manufacturing facility, Morgan Stanley reasons, Tesla stands to double its business (adding another $2 billion in revenue) by selling the lithium ion batteries it typically ships under the hood of a Model S to homeowners with solar panels, too. If consumers can store energy the panels generate during the day for use at night, it would ostensibly render the need for utilities to pipe in faraway power—and their electric bills—obsolete.  The Gigafactory. Image: Tesla Energy storage, when combined with solar power, could disrupt utilities in the US and Europe to the extent customers move to an off-grid approach Musk is also the CEO of Solar City, a company that leases rooftop solar setups to homeowners, and one that would benefit from the battery tech. Now, the shadiness here is that Morgan Stanley released the report trumpeting Tesla's crossover energy storage potential—causing Tesla's stock to rise—right before it underwrote a fundraising round for... Tesla.  So the whole thing is very incestuous, and it does render some of the projections a little suspect, but the bottom line here is that private solar and battery companies are viable enough that they've attracted the backing of one of the world's biggest financial services companies—over the multi-trillion dollar utility industry.  "Energy storage, when combined with solar power, could disrupt utilities in the US and Europe to the extent customers move to an off-grid approach," Morgan Stanley writes in its third report this year emphasizing the prospect. "We believe Teslas energy storage product will be economically viable in parts of the US and Europe, and at a fraction of the cost of current storage alternatives." In other words, Morgan Stanley has Tesla's back, big time. It's betting that Musk is going to make the best solar energy batteries money can buy. Ironically enough, however, even staunch clean energy advocates are wary about Morgan Stanley's finding that utilities are going the way of the buffalo. "Barring extraordinary circumstances, the economic case for grid defection is still very weak for US consumers," Stephen Lacey, the senior editor of Greentech Media, wrote of the Morgan Stanley report. "The electricity system offers valuable backup in case a customer over- or under-invests in an on-site system." It's more likely, then, that people will still buy home solar—by the tens of millions, Greentech suggests—but not unplug from the grid entirely. Utilities will be diminished, but not broken. This process is underway in Europe already, where countries like Germany have powerful incentives for consumers to switch to solar.  Last year, the Economist called the sharp decline of European utilities "startling," noting that together, they lost half their value—$600 billion—in just five years. Here in the states, utilities and conservative politicians are fighting solar tax credits to prevent the same thing from happening. For the most part, the utilities are losing. All of this is, ideally, what needs to happen. Climate change is accelerating, and we need to transition away from those massive, fossil fuel-slurping power plants. Distributed solar is an increasingly powerful force behind that weaning process.  And even if some of Morgan Stanley's calculations are shaky, the trends that Tesla is helping to amplify are anything but—clean, personalized (or community-wide) power will play a major role in shaping our energy future.  The fact that a greed-driven titan of finance like Morgan Stanley recognizes as much, and is willing to triple down on its bets on battery storage and distributed power, is a promising sign that the energy revolution is underway.

                                Photographs are time's static records, whereas cinema is, it's been said, is "sculpting in time." One captures a singular moment, while the other simulates life, allowing the tucked away corridors both in and outside the frame to be revealed over time.  But now, researchers at Carnegie Mellon and University of California, Berkeley are giving the world of still photograph a piece of photo-editing software that will allow users to create 3D manipulations to illuminate the hidden areas of an image. The 3D-photo editing software works by ironing out the graphic flaws in an object's lighting, texture, and shape. It does this using a wealth of images of everyday objects uploaded to the internet on a daily basis. It's image manipulation with the help of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>, and the realistic accuracy puts today's Photoshopping to shame. This could result, researchers suggest, in photo editors being able to convincingly turn cars over, make grandma do a backflip, fake a baby lifting a heavy sofa, make a paper-crane flap its wings (as shown in the video), or manipulate airplanes in a historical photograph to "change its story." But beyond that, there's a glaring potential dark side to this software if it's misused. In the wrong hands, all sorts of deceptive images could hit the internet. Anyone who really wanted to control an image would suddenly be able to do so in a very convincing fashion. That however, is not the researchers' intention. The idea is to enable users to manipulate the photograph while maintaining realism. Professional photo editors, and maybe even future Instagram users, could also use this type of software to effectively drop 3D models of new objects into the scene, achieving a sort of fantastical surrealism in the process. Artists, maybe even the masses, would likely relish this sort of creative story-bending power. As researchers demonstrate in the above video, the software permits users to move photographic elements in 3D fashion, letting users see what lies beneath, behind, below, and in various other locations within the photograph usually obscured during exposure. By using pixel information in the visible parts of objects, it's possible to overcome three types of graphic mismatch that exist between photographed objects and stock 3D modeling: geometry mismatch (the object's shape, whether manmade or natural), appearance mismatch (texture and surface reflectance), and illumination (lighting effects). In other words, photo editors will be able to leverage <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>'s repository of stock 3D images to manipulate photographs at will. "Photo-editing software restricts the control of objects in a photograph to the 2D image plane," the researchers wrote. "We present a method that enables users to perform the full range of 3D manipulations, including scaling, rotation, translation, and nonrigid deformations, to an object in a photograph." As the researchers noted, this type of effect is impossible in traditional 2D photo-editing programs. With this new 3D-based software, photo editors could engage in some surreal and magical special effects. As they said in their research paper, it's all part of encouraging people to become active creators instead of "passive consumers of visual information." Ultimately, they want users to be able to manipulate "what we know about the scene behind the photograph." The researchers want creators to be able to change a photography's story. If this works as they imagine it will, they're going to get that and then some. Let's hope that this photo manipulation software is used for worthwhile creative enterprise instead of deception.

                                Malaria testing could soon be done in the cloud.US Army Africa Remote diagnostics is an emerging field that allows healthcare workers to perform tests on patient samples in the field and to get results interpreted by medical experts remotely. This is a groundbreaking approach to providing affordable healthcare to patients in some of the world’s poorest countries. Providing healthcare in this way, though, often means using expensive equipment, supplying extensive training and getting access to relatively developed telecommunications infrastructure. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today, we present a device that has the potential to overcome these challenges. The uMED Alex Nemiroski Costing only US$25, the universal Mobile Electrochemical Detector, or uMED, can perform chemical and biochemical tests on a variety of commercially available test strips and electrodes and send the results over an audio cable connected to the headphone jack of any cell phone – even if it isn’t a smartphone. After placing a phone call, the user can upload the data over the voice channel of any mobile network (2G, 3G, or 4G) that is present on site. There is no need for an internet connection. An automated cloud database or a medical expert can then return relevant information about test results to the device by text message. The cloud database might be run by a private hospital or a government agency, which can send help if needed. On the other side, that agency can track the results uploaded through uMED to keep tabs on the spread of a disease. The uMED can be used to test for toxic metals in drinking water, to measure a patient’s blood-glucose and electrolyte levels, and even to quantify and diagnose malaria. It could also be used in the future to screen for other diseases, such as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, E. Coli, hepatitis, influenza, West Nile virus or Dengue fever. There are already various low-cost devices that can be used to test patients' health or to diagnose certain diseases. Pregnancy tests, blood-glucose tests and rapid malaria tests all have their uses but are often too limited in what they can detect. In general, diagnostic tests can be either versatile and accurate but expensive and complicated, or rapid and cheap but limited and insensitive. We believe our approach fuses the strengths of these technological extremes, and avoids their weaknesses. How it works Electrochemical detection is widely used to perform chemical testing in well-resourced laboratories. In this type of testing, a voltage applied to a chemical sample causes a reaction that yields a detectable flow of current. The reaction can be controlled to ensure the current produced is related to the concentration of the chemical sample. In this way, concentrations of various chemicals can be measured by interrogating the samples with electronics. Apart from blood-glucose metres, though, these types of measurements typically need expensive and sophisticated instruments. We redesigned a laboratory electrochemical analyser from the ground up to be affordable and tailored it to specifically measure fluid samples with physiological concentrations. It was important to us that all these sophisticated functions could be offered in a single, automated, hand-held device that resembled a blood-glucose meter, because this device in particular is familiar to a lot of people around the world. To build the uMED, we developed a custom electrochemical sensor compatible with the open-source development environment Arduino. This means the uMED can be easily adapted to local needs, and reprogrammed or updated with minimal training. We also added a vibration motor, similar to those found on cellphones, to mix samples when necessary. This eliminated the need for addition equipment that is typically necessary to stir samples during measurements. Although the use of smartphones is rapidly rising, there remain almost three billion people in the world today who still use older technologies for communication, and according to market trends, that number is not set to decrease much over the next decade. That’s why we needed to make uMED compatible with even low-end phones. There is huge potential to improve the health of people and animals in countries where mobile phones are everywhere but high-tech infrastructure is not. The flow of information from a test taken at the point-of-care to a remote medical facility, and back. Alex Nemiroski For most tests, all a healthcare worker needs to do is insert a strip containing a blood, urine, or water sample (or dip an electrode into the sample), select the test they want to perform, and make a phone call to send the results. These can be glucose test strips, screen-printed electrodes, ion-selective electrodes or ultra-low-cost, paper-based electrodes. The uMED is still a work in progress, and we’re working with devices firm Diagnostics For All to improve its diagnostic capacity, particularly in difficult environments. Field trials will start in India soon, with the hope of moving towards a device that can make healthcare easier, even before the internet arrives in hard-to-reach areas.

                                The news: The world's first commercial space launchpad may not be built in Cape Canaveral or Houston. Instead, the first rockets to lift off from a designated commercial facility will embark from one of North America's poorest — and perhaps, least likely — cities: Brownsville, Texas. Of the Brownsville-Harlingen metro area's nearly half a million residents, 36% live below the national poverty line. Close to a quarter of those 25 or older have only a high school diploma; 37% never graduated high school. Yet this is the city where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> chose to build the world's first commercial launching facility, from which he plans to send up to 12 rockets each year into space.

                                Someone's got to do it.Tulane Publications, CC BY-NC-SA The current West African <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus outbreak, which has now reached more than 1,000 cases and resulted in more than 800 deaths, is a reminder of the often unpredictable nature of viruses and the difficulties in finding and developing vaccines and antivirals. The outbreak appears to have focused efforts. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US, said human trials for a vaccine will start in September with a potential vaccine ready by July. His comments come after two infected US doctors were reportedly treated with a serum, believed to be a monoclonal antibody administered under an FDA compassionate exemption that allows drugs to be used outside clinical trial. But even in the case of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus, it has taken nearly 40 years to get this far (partly due to a lack of funding from pharmaceutical companies) and there is no guarantee that these treatments will be successful. Handling viruses Other viruses that pose a continuous threat of disease include seasonal influenza, measles and mumps, and also viruses that pass from animals to humans, such as the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span> <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus">coronavirus</a></span> and avian influenzas. Understanding these diseases can lead to curbing transmission and the development of new antivirals or vaccines. This is usually done under controlled conditions in the lab or by taking samples in the field and using computers to model virus spread. But it is becoming clear that researchers working on these pathogens don’t agree on how best to study these particularly dangerous viruses and two groups have now emerged with different views. The fear is that this could affect the fields of virology and microbiology as a whole and slow down the speed at which vaccines can be found or developed. The research controversy Controversy surrounds these pathogens because of potential lapses in safety, notably by the Centres for Disease Control (CDC), which admitted employees may have been exposed to anthrax more than once and the NIH, which found six vials of forgotten smallpox (along with other viruses) in a storage room. The most recent uproar was the creation of a dangerous strain of influenza virus by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka and colleagues that could evade the human immune system – in order to aid in the development of new influenza vaccines. In 2010, the labs of Kawaoka and a fellow virologist, Ron Fouchier in The Netherlands, were blocked from publishing work that demonstrated the genetics and characteristics required for avian influenza viruses to transmit between ferrets. As these viruses aren’t normally able to do this and were artificially modified to give them novel properties, the experiments fall under a category called “gain of function” (GOF). The debate rests on whether any potential risk to the public is worth the benefit to be had from an increased understanding of influenza virus biology. The issue sparked a year-long self-imposed moratorium by influenza virologists to assess this but after further guidelines, this type of research has resumed and the withheld studies have been published. Scientists at loggerheads Microbiologists, and virologists in particular, have a long history of working safely with pathogens and have developed effective strategies to protect themselves, the public and the environment from a potential release. Viruses, as well as bacteria and parasites, are classified into biosafety levels, each with their own specific safety strategies. The highest safety categories are three and four (to which <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus belongs), with specialised rooms and buildings together with personal protective gear and rules on coming in and leaving the lab. This is before you consider outside safety checks and funding conditions. Some leading scientists who formed a collective have called for another stop to GOF research. But others who disagree argue that preventing this work would be inhibitory to science and potentially damaging to the field, have instead created another group called Scientists for Science. Their members, backed by the International Union of Microbiological Societies, are confident that current safety measures and high-containment labs around the world are sufficient to protect researchers and the public from any risks involved in working with pathogenic viruses. They believe a broad ban should be avoided in favour of specific consideration on a project-by-project basis. They have called for an independent meeting of scientists, funders and public health officials to work out the best way to proceed, given the difficulty of accurately predicting the future benefits of scientific research. Taking the risk The fact is, if we are to prevent infections and deaths by developing antivirals and vaccines, continuing research into viruses such as influenza and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus is critical. And despite reported lapses in safety in certain labs, changes to current protocols must be balanced against the risks of not undertaking such work, including the bigger potential for spread raised by global travel. Ultimately, working with pathogenic viruses carries some risk. As the most recent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebola">ebola</a></span>virus outbreak and inevitable fears around novel strains of influenza show, finding ways to counter dangerous viruses will require us to go further than we have done so far – and it is something we will need to resolve soon.

                                EPA/Oliver Weiken The continuing slaughter of women and children in Gaza is a painful reminder of the inadequacy of international institutions and our collective inability to impose order, let alone justice, in the world. The absence of a united ‘international community’ is plainly one reason it is so difficult to address even the most confronting and unnecessary of humanitarian crises. There are others, though, which may point to an even more pervasive and corrosive threat to the way we conduct and think about international relations. It is not only the Palestinians who are being brutalised at the moment, though. So are we, albeit at an altogether less traumatic, sensory level. The increasingly routine nature of human suffering not only deadens our emotional responses, it also risks normalising high levels of indiscriminate organised violence as an acceptable part of international affairs. Cynics may say it was ever thus, but it’s important to recognise that – until recently, at least – there seemed to be a growing aversion to using force to ‘solve’ international problems. This is – or was – not only surprising, but mildly optimism-inducing, especially when seen against the backdrop of what some of the leading lights of international relations theory would have us believe. According to Thucydides, widely considered the father of Realist thinking, the strong do what they will and the weak endure what they must. This cheery aphorism not only applied to ancient Greece, Realists claim, but to every period in history – including our own. And yet not only has interstate violence been in precipitous decline for decades, but the most powerful states have not always taken advantage of their overwhelming military superiority. Many people are – understandably, perhaps – critical of America’s involvement in Iraq and the violence this involved and unleashed. What most people don’t consider though is that it might have been far worse. The great paradox of America’s foreign policy is that for all its military might it has been unable to win decisive military victories against Third World, even third rate, opposition. Why? Because American foreign policymakers felt some degree of socially constructed, non-military inhibition about what they could and couldn’t do. In Vietnam, for example, the Americans drew the line at using nuclear weapons in the North, even though there was little chance that either the Soviet Union or China could have done much to stop them. Much the same could be said about North Korea now. The US could remove the North Korean regime and its military tomorrow if it wished to do so, with very little fear of retaliation from China or anyone else. One reason that it does not is that this is simply unacceptable behaviour. For a nation that styles itself the leader of the free world and a beacon of progressive values, killing thousands, possibly millions of innocents to remove a strategic threat would not be a good look – no matter how odious the regime. Put simply, the US is constrained in part by domestic and international public opinion and the norms of non-violence and proportionality that have become an entrenched, if sometimes unrecognised, part of an increasingly transnational order. Being a good international citizen means accepting the legitimacy and appropriateness of such norms. It is precisely this non-material influence on international behaviour that is currently being undermined by recent events. We have already become accustomed to the idea that at least one country has the right, if not the responsibility, to employ <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> to eliminate people who are deemed – rightly or wrongly – to be ‘terrorists’. Inevitably there is ‘collateral damage’ in the form of civilians who are in the wrong place at the wrong time. The ‘good’ thing about such weapons from the perspective of those that deploy them is that they involve no risk to their users, and because they are unseen, evoke little public outcry. What’s happening in Palestine is – or ought to be – different. We can literally see for ourselves that not only is it painfully apparent that blameless women and children are the principal victims, but it also becoming evident that, for some people at least, it is the necessary and acceptable cost of dealing with an implacable foe. In other words, the normative constraints that have hitherto stopped states from using disproportionate force – especially when the world’s media is looking over their shoulders – no longer seem to apply in quite the same way. Our socially constructed, discursively realised, ideas about humanity, morality and justice are in danger of being permanently undermined. True, words will become important once again – if only so the protagonists can use them to call a halt to the current mayhem Gaza. Whether they will have lost some of their potential potency when it comes to curbing future outrages remains to be seen. I’m reluctantly coming to the view that Thucydides may have known something awful, true and timeless about some of the more powerful parts of humanity.

                                KKR and Rhone Capital have joined forces and sweetened the initial May offer for Treasury Wines Estate. Flickr/RobertHodge, CC BY It is sometimes said that at least investors in vineyards can drink their losses. Indeed, it’s been a rocky few years for the Australian wine industry. External pressures have been challenging and much of the industry is in a deep malaise. This is most true for smaller producers, and even more especially true for those at the bottom of the industry’s value chain – the growers of non-premium wine grapes. The pressure was ramped up in May’s with a bid from private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for Treasury Wines Estate (TWE) - the owner of the renowned Penfolds - at $4.70 per share. Joined this week by fellow New York-based hedge fund Rhône Capital, the offer was upped to $5.20. In the absence of something better, or the bidders getting cold feet, the offer looks likely to succeed. Foster’s foray Times were not always so tough for small producers. Throughout the 1990s, both wine production and export prices grew steadily, marking a renaissance for an industry long seen, at home and abroad, as trailing the traditional wine growing regions of Europe in terms of quality and efficiency. Steeped in the history of the South Australian wine industry, Penfolds led the growing recognition of quality Australian wine with Grange (once Grange Hermitage), generally considered one of the world’s great reds – with a price tag to match. In hindsight its acquisition by Foster’s in 2005 was a disaster, more so for Foster’s than the Oatley family, who cashed out their stake acquired when they rolled their Rosemount business into Southcorp Wines previously. Foster’s takeover was driven by the view that the beer industry was mature and lacking in growth, and thus Foster’s management wanted something more exciting. They certainly found this through the acquisition of wine producers. Beer and wine – what could possibly go wrong? As it turned out, just about everything went wrong! Beer and spirits are essentially industrial products, while wine is deeply rooted in agriculture. External factors beyond the control of the company did not help – including a soaring Australian dollar, drought, powerful retail buyers and a production glut producing intense competition from other “new world” producers for sales. Foster’s spun off the various wine businesses that it had assiduously acquired into TWE in 2011. Independent of Foster’s, TWE did well for a time, before falling foul of the buying power of Australia’s retail duopoly of Coles/Wesfarmers and Woolworths in late 2013 and 2014. This was especially true in the vital lead-up to Christmas 2013, when sales slumped and profit projections were downgraded. What next for Australia’s wine industry? What the Treasury Wines buyout means for the remainder of the Australian wine industry is an important question. KKR and Rhône clearly see an opportunity to cut costs and build profits before selling the business off in a few years. Likely casualties in such a scenario will be the less profitable labels that produce low margin, low priced wine. This process was already underway at TWE, but will likely accelerate under the new ownership. For many grape growing communities, this process may spell disaster. Already struggling with prices that barely cover the cost of picking, a smaller industry more focused on premium wine will likely see a mass exodus of producers within SA’s Riverland, Victoria’s Murray Valley and the NSW Riverina. The upside for the bidders will be building the penetration of their major labels, especially Grange and the remainder of its ‘icon and luxury brands’ into Asia, and especially China. China’s love affair with (premium) wine China’s love affair with imported premium wine is symptomatic of wider trends. An escalation of both import volumes and average prices per bottle to China have been driven by gift giving and extravagant hospitality. KKR and Rhône see this trend as likely to continue, in spite of the mooted austerity drive of top Communist party officials. Chinese consumers of wine are generally within its upper economic echelons, and for them consumption of imported wine is as much about status symbolism as the product itself. Thus, for Australian wine producers hoping to replicate Penfolds’ success, the challenge will be to get the right balance between price, volumes and market image. This won’t be easy. Penfolds has both an established brand story and access to Chinese consumers through its distribution network. For smaller producers, replicating both of these will be a challenge. Groups like Australia’s First Families of Wine are attempting to do just this in a collaborative manner. As private companies, their success is hard to gauge, but their premium products and strong brands should hold them in good stead. Longer term, the prospect of a hundred million middle-class Chinese drinking imported wine (albeit of the more humble, non-premium variety) regularly is an enticing prospect for Australian exporters. What the last two decades have shown, however, is they will have strong competition. Barriers to increasing supply of such wine from producers in Chile, New Zealand and South Africa are limited. Even if exports in wine volumes in these lower priced products increase, margins will be scant. In this regard, the future for wine grape growers throughout inland Australia does not look good. Combined with perennial problems of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=water scarcity">water scarcity</a></span> and salinity, images from Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath come to mind. Managing the social and economic consequences of this for inland wine grape growing regions will be an important challenge.

Mount Sinai Hospital said in a statement that a male patient arrived at the hospital’s emergency room on Monday morning complaining of a high fever and gastrointestinal problems. The patient had recently returns from a trip to a "West African country" where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> has been reported. The hospital says the patient was placed in "strict isolation” and is being screened for the deadly virus. Jeremy Boal, Chief Medical Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System, told reporters that the hospital plans on working carefully with the CDC to make sure the patient does not have the deadly virus.

More than 700 West Africans have died, and the battle is far from over. Who is really to blame? How about greedy pharmaceutical companies? Scientists have made great strides in developing an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccine, but so far exactly zero candidates have made it past the stage of clinical trials. Vaccines, which require billions of dollars to research and develop, rely on funds from pharmaceutical companies. So despite the fact that many vaccines have made it to the first level of testing, they often can't surpass the intervening hurdles without a big push from private corporations. Here's the problem: Pharmaceutical companies, for whom decisions must make sense financially, won't take a risk on investing in a vaccine for a disease that only surfaces periodically in low-income countries. Governments and research universities are supposed to help by filling the funding gap. Read More

                                From 1990 to 2010, deaths from chronic kidney disease (CKD) rose by about 82% worldwide—the third largest increase among the top 25 causes of death after <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> (396%) and diabetes (93%). In England, about £1·45 billion was spent on caring for people with CKD in 2009–10, just 1·3% of National Health Service spending, and a substantial proportion of this cost was devoted to renal replacement therapy in the small proportion of patients with kidney failure. In July, the UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its clinical guideline on CKD, aiming to ensure consistent identification of CKD and thereby improve management.

                                There are some articles journal editors will wish they hadn't brought to public attention. But there will also be papers they are immensely grateful to have published. One such Lancet paper is Julio Montaner's truly landmark 2006 viewpoint entitled, rather modestly now looking back, “The case for expanding access to highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] to curb the growth of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> epidemic”. The paper began by charting, since its inception in 1996, the rise and impact of HAART. Montaner and his team went on to hypothesise that, “A prevention-centred approach would therefore argue that treating 100% of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected individuals at once could greatly reduce <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission.

Emory's facility is designed for extreme levels of clinical isolation, such as high efficiency air filters and decontamination safeguards. Read More

                                The current outbreak of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in West Africa continues to worsen. Nearly 700 people have died from the virus across Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, including Sierra Leone's top <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> doctor. Fortunately, the closest many of us will ever come to understanding the spread of hemorrhagic fevers is from Hollywood. Unfortunately, most of those dramatizations propagate entertainment at the expense of reality. Take Outbreak, the 1995 thriller about the Motaba virus, a hyper-infectious <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> stand-in. Without revealing too much of the plot, Motaba eventually works its way into the United States, causing mass panic and a classic disaster film showdown between the military and a handful of morally righteous doctors. While it's a great movie, Outbreak reinforces several myths about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> and disease research.

                                AT FIRST glance it would appear that China has gone online, and gone digital, with great gusto. The spectacular rise of internet stars such as Alibaba, Tencent and JD would certainly suggest so. The country now has more smartphone users and households with internet access than any other. Its e-commerce industry, which turned over $300 billion last year, is the world’s biggest. The forthcoming stockmarket flotation of Alibaba may be the largest yet seen.So it is perhaps surprising to hear it argued that much of Chinese business has still not plugged in to the internet and to related trends such as cloud computing and “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” analysis; and therefore that these technologies’ biggest impact on the country’s economy is still to come. That is the conclusion of a report published on July 24th by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), a think-tank run by the eponymous consulting firm. It finds that only one-fifth of Chinese firms are using cloud-based data storage and processing power, for example, compared with three-fifths of American ones. Chinese businesses spend only 2% of their revenues on information technology, half the global average. Even the biggest, most...

The company has been pilloried for academic research it published, showing that by adjusting its users’ news feeds so that a greater proportion of positive or negative items appeared, it could nudge people to post slightly sunnier or gloomier items themselves. For sociologists, the study provided evidence of “social contagion”—the spread of ideas and moods through imitation and conformity—without face-to-face contact.That Facebook runs similar tests all the time for commercial reasons—to get users to linger longer, or to click on ads—was largely lost on the critics. And the most telling bit went unnoticed: the difference in posting behaviour was between 0.04% and 0.1%. It sounds paltry, and is. But to Facebook’s data scientists, it amounted to a smashing victory. “Given the massive scale,” they noted, “even small effects can have large aggregated consequences.”This may indeed be the unspoken secret of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>. The much-hyped term captures the idea that it has become possible to collect vastly more data than before, and to process it far more cheaply and quickly. The result, typically, is to...

                                THE star of the show was missing from the skies above the Farnborough air show, Europe’s biggest aerospace get-together, which began on July 14th. The F-35 fighter (pictured), which was to have made its first appearance outside America, is grounded after an engine fire. Not taking to the air when expected is a trait of Lockheed Martin’s jet. It is years behind schedule and stratospherically over budget. Its absence is an embarrassment for Lockheed but, then again, its presence might have reminded the defence officials shopping for kit at Farnborough of just the sort of complex and expensive programme that they want to avoid signing up to in future.Arms-makers are going through a lean period. Some big contracts, such as ones to make bombers, trainer aircraft and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, are still up for grabs in America, the world’s biggest spender. But it and other rich-world governments, struggling to curb their deficits, are trying ever harder to get the most bang for the fewest bucks. The revenues of 17 of the top 20 American weapons-makers shrank in 2013. American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had helped to push global spending to a record $1.7 trillion in 2008. Since then it has plunged by $100...

                                FOR years the BRICS countries have insisted they are more than an acronym. To dispel any lingering doubts, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, who gathered in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza for their sixth annual summit on July 15th, announced the creation of two financial institutions: the New Development Bank (NDB) to finance infrastructure and “sustainable development” projects, with $50 billion in capital to start with, and the $100 billion Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), to tide over members in financial difficulties.On the surface, the NDB and the CRA, which must still be approved by the five countries’ parliaments, look like upstart rivals to the World Bank and the IMF, together the cornerstone of the post-war economic order. The BRICS complain that the Bretton Woods outfits, named after a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> town where they were conceived 70 years ago this month, give the developing world short shrift. China, whose economy is second only to America’s, has fewer votes there than the Benelux countries. America and Europe have proved shamefully slow to redress the imbalance.Recipients of IMF cash also resent the tough reforms on which help is conditional, not to mention the lecturing tone in which they are dictated. In Fortaleza Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, extolled the NDB and CRA as a way to prevent the “harassment” of countries...
