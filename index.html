                                Days after agents with the Bureau of Land Management ended their effort to round up Cliven Bundy's cattle to ease mounting tensions, the showdown between the rancher and the federal government is still attracting armed conservative activists from around the country to a dusty stretch of land about 80 miles east of the Vegas Strip.  Last Tuesday, as he started to read more and more about the situation on The Drudge Report, Jerry DeLemus decided to give Bundy a call. They spent more than an hour on the phone. "What do you need?" said DeLemus, who was calling from some 2,700 miles away in Dover, N.H.  "I need help," Bundy told him. "I need bodies." "I'm coming," DeLemus said.  It was as simple as that, DeLemus told Business Insider Tuesday. Soon, he began the long drive in his truck. His son; his friend, Jack; and Jack's son accompanied him on the cross-country trip. All in all, it took 41 hours across a three-day span. They began driving at 5:30 a.m. last Thursday and made it there by Saturday afternoon. They barely took any breaks. This Wednesday, DeLemus remains in Nevada. He is now running the makeshift "militia" of conservatives protecting the ranch, some of whom are armed with handguns and rifles. DeLemus said about 100 conservative activists are still there, three days after federal agents returned hundreds of cattle they had taken from the ranch. To DeLemus and these other activists, the Bundy ranch standoff is one of their most important fights yet over what they consider to be an oppressive federal government. "We are willing to give our lives," he said in a phone interview. Bundy's fight with the federal Bureau of Land Management dates back to 1993, when the BLM eliminated livestock grazing in the area, citing protection of an endangered tortoise species. That was when Bundy decided to stop paying grazing fees. And now, the agency says he owes more than $1.2 million in fees. A federal judge first ruled in 1998 that Bundy was trespassing on federal land. Last year, a federal judge ruled the agency could remove the cattle. The BLM, among others, says Bundy is breaking the law. But activists view the situation in terms of a dispute over states' rights and an oppressive federal government. It was a major topic of conversation among conservative activists last weekend in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span>, where the grassroots groups Americans for Prosperity Foundation and Citizens United hosted the Freedom Summit. It was there that Business Insider met DeLemus' wife, Susan, who said he had been inspired by "freedom." "Lawlessness," DeLemus said of the situation. "You look that up in the dictionary, and you'll see the definition of our government right beside it. They all are. Congress, both houses, and the White House." Despite the retreat of the BLM, which cited "escalating tensions" when it returned the cattle to Bundy, DeLemus and many others there have no plan to leave anytime soon.  "You s---in' me?" he said, when asked if he was planning to head back to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span>.  They, and the Bundy family, do not believe their fight with the federal government has ended. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the senior senator from Nevada, said Monday the situation was "not over," citing Bundy's apparent violation of federal law. BLM spokesman Craig Leff told CBS News the agency would now seek to resolve the situation "administratively and judicially," but was unclear on the specific next steps. Bundy, DeLemus, and the other activists, however, might face another, more unexpected hurdle. They have failed to see much support from some prominent conservatives, who are far from unified in their opinions on the situation. Daily Caller editor Tucker Carlson said on Fox News Monday that, while Bundy was mistreated by the federal government, the land doesn't belong to him. Conservative host Glenn Beck warned conservatives against glorifying "the right's version of Occupy Wall Street." DeLemus is an avid follower of Beck, having started up a local version of Beck's "9-12 project," comprised of nine principles and 12 values Beck says represent those of the Founding Fathers. Though he said he actually agreed with some of the points made by Occupy Wall Street, DeLemus thinks there's a key difference here: The Bundy supporters are not being reactionary and "causing destruction." They are fighting for constitutional rights, he said. His message to Beck and other skeptical conservatives: Come to Nevada and see the situation firsthand.  "Glenn doesn't know the whole story," DeLemus said. "He needs to come out here."

                                A service is soon to launch in the UK that will enable us to transfer money to other people using just their name and mobile number. Paym is being hailed as a revolution in banking because you can pay people without needing to know their account number or sort code. In many respects it is. Paym cuts out the need for a dash to a cash machine. Distance is also not an issue as you could easily top up your children’s bank balance when they are away from home, solving immediate financial dilemmas. And the main security risk appears to come from user error – the one thing you yourself can actually control. What is Paym? As of 29 April, customers of nine banks including Barclays, Halifax, TSB and Santander can use Paym. Although each will have their own approach to offering the service, the principle remains the same for all. As long as you have registered your mobile number and the receiver of the payment has also registered their mobile number, you should be able to use an app on your phone or an internet banking option to make the payment. It sounds simple because for you, the customer, it is supposed to be. This simplicity has made systems similar to Paym phenomenally successful in many parts of the world. M-Pesa is one particularly popular version that has been operating for several years in India and Kenya. As technology evolved over the past decades, the typical cabled telecommunications structure used in developed nations such as the UK, USA or Australia couldn’t be delivered on the same terms for many African, Asian and South American regions. While many western nations had an existing infrastructure that had evolved over 100 years and could be adapted to make room for more cables, the costs of bringing it in afresh in many developing countries was prohibitively expensive. More recent developments in mobile telecommunications such as 3G and 4G networks, on the other hand, are easier to deploy. The cable costs are low and by strategically positioning the mobile towers needed to run the network, you can reach a large population of customers. The use and trust of this technology in developing countries shows us how it could offer interesting benefits to new markets. We all make one-off payments, where the speed of technology could easily beat the slowness of cheques. Parents probably recall when they have to help out a hapless teen or university student with a cash top-up when they are away from the nest, making Paym a potentially essential service. We could pay babysitters, lend a tenner to a friend and cover school trips for our younger children when they’ve forgotten to mention that it’s today. Additionally, we could find that sole traders, market stalls and micro businesses thrive, knowing that they could have a way for a casual customer who otherwise did not have the cash in their pocket to make an immediate transaction for that artisan product. In fact I am sure that entrepreneurs out there could find other ways of offering services and encourage Paym style payments. And it is a free service Paym assures us that there is little risk in using this service but, as with all financial transactions, it pays to be cautious. Card fraud is a known issue, chip and pin is not infallible and there have been issues with some retailers when using contactless payments. There is a transaction limit of £20 and three transactions a day on contactless payments. That means there is still the potential for a £60 fraud to occur. While this is a relatively small amount, it could still cause financial problems. With Paym, depending on your account and the agreement you have made with your bank, you can transfer up to £250 per day. That’s a significant amount of money if something were to go awry. For a start, you must take care when entering the mobile number of the recipient. That seems obvious but mobile numbers are 11 digits in length and we’ve all typed in the wrong number at some point. You should also include the name of the recipient in the transaction, via your smartphone or web browser application. But as we all know, there are many John Smiths out there, so the probability exists that you could pay someone other than your friend John Smith. But because the UK service links bank accounts, users will avoid the most serious type of crime that affects M-Pesa – the robbery or deception of the agents used to deposit money into the system. With Paym, would have to have knowledge of the passwords and other security mechanisms to use your banking app or online account so you are reasonably well protected in this respect. As you already are already a bank customer, the service like cheque banking, contactless or chip-and-pin is free for you to use. Should you use it? This is certainly a payment technology worth trying. I like using contactless in cafes, for example. Paym seems like a useful way for me to give money to family and friends and I can see potentially useful applications for charities, schools, community groups and microbusinesses too. If you intend to use it, practice with small amounts. Don’t suddenly pay £200 to someone. Give them a very small amount, eventually the opportunity will present itself. Check and double check their phone number. In all transactions, the best way to make sure you have the right number and name is to give them a call on the number you are going to use. This will considerably reduce the risk of unintended errors.

                                The Pentagon is backing Physical Sciences Inc.'s new type of 'backpack' <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>, named the InstantEye, which was inspired by the flying prowess of dragonflies, Foreign Policy reports. Physical Sciences Inc. first received funding in 2008 for the InstantEye to determine whether movements from birds and insects could be worked into <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> designs to make the systems more robust. Dr. Richard Guiler, the lead developer, told Foreign Policy that the company drew inspiration from dragonflies due to the insect's amazing capability of handling 35 mile-per-hour winds along with their ability to recover from collisions. Physical Sciences initially planned on developing a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> with flapping wings but ultimately designed the InstantEye to have four aerial rotors instead. Research into dragonflies yielded algorithms that have been worked into the InstantEye that allow the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> to recover successfully after collisions and stay aloft during intense winds due to its unique stability design. The InstantEye, weighing only one pound and equipped with a high definition camera, is currently being tested by the Pentagon. Physical Sciences hopes the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> can be used for surveillance, as well as helping to identify casualties in disaster relief.

                                For the past few months, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span> has been warning that utilities must adapt to growing demand for renewable storage, or risk getting left behind.  "There will be some amount of strife for existing utilities, particularly ones heavy into fossil rules," Musk said at a panel earlier this year. "There will be bit of a hardship for them. But we have no choice. We have to decide if we're going to have clean, sustainable energy or not and if we decide want good future...and the only good future is one with [clean] energy." Goldman Sachs' clean tech analyst Brian Lee has interpreted these kinds of comments this as a signal that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span> is aiming for "grid defection" — whereby customers would create self-sufficient energy systems on their property. This morning, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span> sought to bury the hatchet with utilities. In a new note this morning, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span> co-founder and CTO Peter Rive, cousin of company chair <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>, said utilities have an important place in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span>'s rollout of storage systems. While there is tension between utilities and companies like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span>, we work with them every day to connect our solar power systems, and there's potential for much greater synergy," he writes. "In fact, batteries should power that synergy. One of the more polarizing ideas going around is that battery storage will lead to mass defections from the grid. Needing only their solar and their batteries, the story goes, Americans will simply cut the cord. While this is technically feasible, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span> has no interest in this scenario.  In an exclusive interview with BI, Rive clarified his stance. "There's this misconception that the reason why <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span> is developing this technology is to remove customers from the grid," he said. "The truth is quite far from that. The reason we've developing storage is that clean solar, with reasonably priced storage, can lower the overall price of energy, especially when it's in the hands of grid operators." Rive said utilities remain best suited to regulating load and generation capability on their grids, and that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span>'s technologies can serve as "tools" to help lower costs and smooth out demand imbalances. "The key overarching point is that the benefits of solar inverters and storage is massive, especially in the hands of grid operators," he said. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span>'s statement comes as the California Public Utilities Commission clarified how utilities should price the cost of connecting <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span>'s units to their grids. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span> had recently hammered California's three major energy service providers for seemingly dragging their feet and overcharging on installation.  "As far as we can tell, utilities are generally in agreement" with the ruling Rive said. "A lot has happened in the past week or so." He did not comment on how soon utilities will begin speeding up their connections.  In the blog post, Rive announced he's created a Grid Engineering Solutions department designed to "to help solve the challenges preventing the shift from the grid that we currently have, to the grid that we need." The grid is not going anywhere.  <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: 25 Huge Trends That Will Make People Billions Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                GOOGLE splashed out an undisclosed sum of money on April 14th to buy Titan Aerospace, whose solar-powered <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> it plans to use to help deliver wireless internet access to remote parts of the world. Like Google’s new <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, which can reach impressive heights, tech shares soared in the early part of this year. Then in March a sell-off began that battered the stocks of many Silicon Valley stars. The tech-heavy NASDAQ stockmarket index steadied somewhat early this week, and shares in older tech firms like HP and IBM, which are traded on the main market, have done well. But investors and companies are still jittery.Those worried that a new internet bubble pumped up by wild dreams and unabashed greed is now deflating will be watching closely to see whether tech firms’ latest results give further cause for alarm. On April 15th Yahoo published its quarterly earnings, which showed a tiny increase in revenue after excluding the cost of fees paid to its partner websites. Its shares rose on the news. Google was due to report its results the next day, after The Economist went to press.It is not just web firms whose performance is under the microscope. Shares in biotech companies, which adapt and exploit processes found in living organisms to create drugs and other useful products, have also taken a beating. Having risen by 60% last year, the NASDAQ biotech...

                                There are certain things that don't need to be reinvented, like the wheel. But once in a while, someone transforms an everyday object no one thought could be improved. Here are some of the best redesigns of regular household objects we've recently seen. 1. This kitchen table doubles in size in mere seconds. The Fletcher Capstan Table expands from a standard 6.5- or 10-foot table to one that measures anywhere between 20 and 30 feet across. The round tables come in four standard sizes, and expand by simply rotating the top 180 degrees manually or electronically by remote. The tables are customizable, and range from $50,000 to $70,000 on the UK Fletcher website. 2. “LiquiGlide” allows condiments to flow effortlessly out of a bottle. LiquiGlide is a coating of non-toxic materials that allows every single drop of your favorite condiment to flow out effortlessly, reducing a ton of waste. Invented by five MIT students and their professor, LiquiGlide was named one of Time’s Best Inventions of 2012 and came in second in MIT’s $100,000 Entrepreneurship Competition. The inventors currently create the coating for specific clients. 3. These ‘invisible’ bike helmets inflate on impact. The Hövding, or invisible bike helmet, is the brainchild of two students at the University of Lund. The Hövding is actually an air bag that uses a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helium">helium</a></span> gas cylinder to inflate when its sensors detect a sudden jolt. The airbag is like a hood, except it’s shock absorbent and able to withstand multiple head impacts. The helmets are expensive, retailing on Hövding for more than $400 (£299). 4. An Austrian artist reinvented the door with origami panels. Artist Klemens Torggler's Evolution Door is a 4-panel "flip panel door" that opens and closes elegantly as though it's made of pieces of paper.  Torggler has a few variations on this door, including one with origami-esque triangles that fold out to help the door move, and another system with rods that rotate two square panels. He sells them on his website for an undisclosed price (which depends on materials and design). 5. The toilet of the future folds up to save water and space. Two British university students invented the Iota toilet, which folds in after use. Its creators claim it uses 50% less water than a stationary toilet, and is also comparatively smaller, so it can fit into tiny bathrooms. The  rimless design also makes it much easier to clean. Currently the Iota is just a concept, but with an overwhelming Internet response, it could become a reality. 6. These light bulbs are Wi-Fi-enabled, multicolored, and smartphone-controlled. First funded on Kickstarter where it raised more than $1 million, LIFX is a new kind of lightbulb that is not only multicolored, but can be controlled through any device with Wi-Fi and an app. The bulbs can last up to 25 years, and have a lot of cool functions. In addition to changing colors, there's a sleep mode that dims your lights at night and brightens them in the morning, as well as a switch you control with your phone. The bulbs sell at LIFX for $99. 7. A shapeless water blob could replace today's water bottles. Ooho is a biodegradable and edible membrane made of brown algae that can hold water. The flexible water bottle kind of resembles a silicone implant, and is easy to break and sip from. Ooho was developed by three London design students who were aiming to make something sustainable, durable, and cheap — it only costs two cents to make, though the bizarre shape could prove problematic for on-the-go drinking. Ooho currently remains a prototype. 8. This regenerating candle can be reused again and again. Called the Rekindle Candle and designed by artist Benjamin Shine, this candle holder collects melting wax to form a new candle in the base. As the candle burns, melting wax drips down from the candle and accumulates inside a transparent stem with a wick. Once the candle is completely melted, you can crack open the mold to remove a new, fully formed candle (you can then start the whole process over again). Due to an outpouring of support, Shine's prototype is now coming to market. 9. An inflatable, revolutionary car seat will change the game for parents. Volvo’s new rear-facing car seat inflates in 40 seconds using an integrated pump. It only weighs 11 pounds, which is about half the weight of a regular car seat. Deflated, it fits neatly into a backpack, especially convenient for parents traveling with a child. The reinvented car seat, made with a fabric that can sustain high internal pressure, was originally developed by the military and is now used by the boating industry. There's no word on when the inflatable seat could come to market, but hopefully it will be soon. 10. This nightlight keeps outlets free and lasts for 25 years. The SnapRays GuideLight went absolutely crazy on Kickstarter after being posted in March, raising nearly $470,000 over its initial goal. It’s pretty easy to see why, since the light replaces bulky night lights that take up outlet space, and is easy to assemble. You can pre-order the SnapRays GuideLight through creator Jeremy Smith’s website at $15 for one, $42 for three, $65 for five, and $120 for 10. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: 12 Awesome Gifts Ideas That Appeared On 'Shark Tank' DON'T FORGET: Follow Business Insider's Lifestyle Sectuin On Facebook!

Gox, the embattled <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin">bitcoin</a></span> exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection last month after losing almost half a billion dollars' worth of customers' virtual funds, is now reportedly asking a Tokyo court for permission to liquidate. According to The Wall Street Journal, the once leading exchange has abandoned its attempt to rebuild the business under bankruptcy protection due to the complexity and unrealistic nature of the plans. One source says that Mt. Gox is still attempting to find a buyer, which may entitle creditors to a portion of future earnings. But the exchange's decision to file for liquidation after planning rehabilitation means those with substantial investments are likely to get less of their money back.

                                In 1997, Douglas Rushkoff boldly predicted the emergence a new caste of tech-literate adolescents. He argued that the children of his day would soon blossom into “screenagers”, endowed with effortless advantages over their parents, having been raised from birth on a diet of computers and micro-chipped devices. Fast-forward to 2014: the screenagers have come of age in a world ruled by Twitter and Candy Crush Saga. A substantial body of evidence addresses the ways in which media saturation shapes the identities of children and adolescents. While there are clear benefits to maturing as a digital native, a number of experts are concerned about the physical and psychological health of our screenagers. The perils of media-immersion There are advantages of tech-literacy from an early age such as gaining IT skills that will serve you well in the future but there are risks too. Aside from the dangers of social isolation and physical inactivity, there are also dangers that come not directly from any IT medium itself, but what happens when children are exposed to them. The ability to access pornography or gamble online throws up all kinds of issues when children are involved. Particularly insidious are “foot-in-the-door” products which, combined with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> marketing techniques, specifically target adolescents and stimulate pathological behaviour. For example, a number of free Facebook games, including Zynga Poker and Slotomania, normalise gambling and divorce the thrill of playing from the consequences of losing. The player gets to experience the highs of winning but because there is no money involved, they don’t suffer any real life consequences when they lose. This poses a major risk and could lead to problem gambling in adolescence. Other freemium app and internet games also carry a risk factor for pathological behaviour. So-called “casual games” such as Flappy Bird, Bejeweled and Candy Crush Saga use behavioural conditioning techniques to keep players invested for long stretches, which may inhibit the social development of youngsters. And even if we don’t buy into the moral panic so often spread by the media, there is evidence to suggest that sustained access to pornography can have detrimental effects on young people. Mental health website Psych Central reports that not only is pornography easy to stumble across online (with search terms like “toy” often throwing up adult images) repeated exposure can be over-stimulating and potentially addictive for young people. According to the site, “Cybersex addiction functions in a similar way to any other addiction, leading to a cycle of preoccupation, compulsion, acting out, isolation, self-absorption, shame and depression as well as distorted views of real relationships and intimacy.” Most susceptible to compulsive porn viewing are teens with limited parental support, which also correlates with unsupervised web access. New addictions While the addictiveness of certain activities is reasonably well established, the more general concept of “media addiction” in young people is harder to pin down. For a start, it isn’t easy to define addiction as it applies to any activity, even traditional problems such as gambling. So when it comes to new technologies and services, the picture becomes more confused. It is tempting to discuss “media addiction” as a catch-all term for spending too much time online but there are so many opportunities for digital natives to engage in harmful activities that we ought to think in more detail about the problems that can arise for them. While we might group people together as “Facebook addicts”, for example, there may well be a big difference between someone who spends an unhealthy amount of time growing virtual tomatoes on Farmville and another who might be pathologically engrossed in instant messaging. Starting young These phenomena are disconcerting enough on their own but we also need to address the fact that for today’s youngsters, the process of media immersion often begins in very early childhood. Last year, campaign group Common Sense Media and electronics company VTech carried out a survey of 1,463 parents with children aged under eight in the US and found 75% had access to smart devices. This was up from 52% in 2011. This suggests that by the time they hit their teens, there is a high probability that young children will be active participants in global information networks. Whereas children of the 1990s were raised on a diet of discontinuous digital media (MTV and 16-bit gaming), the next wave of screenagers will hold multiple social media accounts, exposing them to all the hazards this level of connectivity implies. From underage users viewing gambling as a source of wealth to adolescents whose formative sexuality is filtered through internet porn, the influence of media-immersion on developing minds is disquieting. One can only imagine the mental state of young people when a universe of information, temptations and perils can be carried around in their pocket. While it’s obvious that internet-use carries huge advantages for young people, they also need to be educated about the dangers before addictions develop.

But the models may hide rather than reveal the deepest sources of social ills. In 1969, Playboy published a long, freewheeling interview with Marshall McLuhan in which the media theorist and sixties icon sketched a portrait of the future that was at once seductive and repellent. Noting the ability of digital computers to analyze data and communicate messages, he predicted that the machines eventually would be deployed to fine-tune society’s workings. “The computer can be used to direct a network of global thermostats to pattern life in ways that will optimize human awareness,” he said. “Already, it’s technologically feasible to employ the computer to program societies in beneficial ways.” He acknowledged that such centralized control raised the specter of “brainwashing, or far worse,” but he stressed that “the programming of societies could actually be conducted quite constructively and humanistically.”

                                Condoms break, contraceptive pills are missed and in the throes of passion, contraception might be overlooked. So from time to time, a woman may need emergency contraception, known as the morning-after pill. The morning-after pill is available in Australian pharmacies without prescription. The pharmacist may ask you about what contraception you are using and what other medication you’re taking. But you will not be required to show identification. The most commonly used morning-after pill available in Australia is Postinor. This pill contains the hormone progestogen and can be taken as a single dose (1.5 mg) or as two doses (0.75 mg, 12 hours apart). Both are equally as effective. How does it work? The chance of pregnancy is greatest in the two days leading up to and including ovulation. An egg lives for 24 hours and sperm can live for up to three to five days, therefore conception can occur several days after sex. The morning-after pill works by delaying the increase in the hormone that starts ovulation, the release of an egg. By delaying or stopping the egg from being released, the sperm can’t reach the egg and pregnancy can’t occur. The morning-after pill therefore needs to be taken before the hormone surge occurs; its effectiveness decreases the closer it’s given to ovulation and it is not effective if given after fertilisation has occurred. Copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) are an alternative method of contraception and can be inserted up to five days after unprotected sex. Depending on the type, IUDs protect against pregnancy for five or ten years. In the past, the morning-after pill has been thought to prevent implantation and has therefore been termed an abortifacient. This is categorically incorrect. Implantation can only occur if an embryo is created when a sperm enters an egg. If fertilisation has not occurred then an embryo has not been created and therefore the morning-after pill is not preventing implantation. Pharmacists should therefore have no hesitation in dispensing the morning-after pill, no matter what their personal beliefs on abortion. How effective is it? The earlier the morning-after pill is taken after unprotected sex, the greater the success in preventing pregnancy. Ideally the pill should be taken within 72 hours, in which case the rate of efficacy is around 85%. If taken after 72 hours, the effectiveness reduces. At 120 hours, the risk of pregnancy is five times greater than if taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex. After taking the morning-after pill, women should use a barrier method of contraception, such as condoms, for the remainder of their cycle. The morning-after pill might delay the next period. But if it’s more than 21 days late, it’s best to take a pregnancy test. Recent research has shown that as a woman’s weight increases, the effectiveness of the morning-after pill decreases. Obese women (with a body mass index of 30 or above) who take the morning-after pill are four times as likely as their healthy weight counterparts to become pregnant. Being obese doesn’t preclude women from taking the morning-after pill but it’s important to note it reduces its efficacy. In such cases, women may choose to have a copper IUD inserted instead. There are medicines that interact with the morning-after pill and potentially make it less effective: some anti-epilepsy medicines, St John’s Wort and drugs for tuberculosis and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. These medicines speed up the breakdown of the morning-after pill in the body. It’s important to tell your pharmacists about other medicines you’re taking in case there is a drug interaction. In such cases, your pharmacist may recommended you take a higher dose of Postinor. Is it safe? There have been no deaths or reports of serious problems after taking the morning-after pill and it’s also safe to use while breastfeeding. If pregnancy does occur, there is no evidence the drug will cause any harm to the fetus. It has never been shown that accessibility to the morning-after pill leads to an increase in use, an increase in unprotected sex or to a decrease in the use of ongoing contraception. It’s important that all women – especially teenagers – are well informed on the availability of the morning-after pill. This information should be given in an impartial manner without judgement.

                                Amazon Web Services gives developers access to massive computing capability. Now hackers have found ways to hijack some accounts and use that power to make money on someone else's dime. Joe Moreno’s bill for Amazon Web Services is usually about $5 a month. But last Thursday, he learned his AWS credentials had been compromised. An unknown person started renting computing power from Amazon on his account, racking up more than $5,300 in charges on servers in Amazon data centers as far away as Tokyo, São Paulo, Sydney, and Singapore. It appeared that he was running processes that "mined" <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>—creating units of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currency">digital currency</a></span> in exchange for processing transactions. We Have Met The Enemy, And He Is Us Given the timing of the attack, Moreno initially thought the Heartbleed bug was to blame, until he tracked down the breach and realized it was his own error. In addition to developers' usernames and passwords for their accounts, AWS uses "access keys" which are easier to include in software. And that's the problem—developers include them in software, including copies of the software they store in public source-code repositories like GitHub. Moreno had uploaded code to a GitHub repository, inadvertently including his Amazon credentials.  You might think this is an isolated case, but a security expert in Australia discovered almost 10,000 AWS credentials in a search of GitHub last month. Ty Miller, founder of security testing firm Threat Intelligence, found exposed credentials for Amazon, Google's Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure in GitHub repositories, but the largest number were for Amazon. "These credentials are likely to provide full access to the AWS account," Miller told ReadWrite. That means hackers could delete data or add data and start new computing processes which could perform just about any task. Amazon appears to be aware of the problem. The company specifically warns developers against including their credentials in code that they upload. But it's not clear how Amazon can police the problem. Amazon For Nothing And Your Servers For Free Moreno discovered the breach to his account after receiving email from Amazon asking him to update his credit-card information. Moreno, a former software developer at Apple, logged in and noticed the charges. He immediately contacted Amazon. "Your AWS credentials have been compromised," the Amazon representative said. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> mining was a common goal of these hackers, though the AWS computing resources could be used for all kinds of money-making schemes. When software consultant Ted Howard learned of Moreno’s experience, he commiserated. On April 5, he had learned that his Amazon account had been hacked. “I immediately changed my password, disabled my access key and created a new key," he told ReadWrite. Howard also believes the breach was likely his fault. After checking his GitHub repository, he found that he had committed a file that contained his AWS access key. “I seem to be incapable of escaping my own stupidity,” he said. But the unintentional publication of AWS credentials appears to be a common problem. It even happened to security researcher Rich Mogull in January. Keys To The Computing Kingdom Howard thought his immediate problem was over, though he still had the bill to settle with Amazon. But on Friday, after communicating with Moreno, he discovered yet another security breach on his AWS account, despite the steps he had already taken to secure it.   After Moreno’s Amazon troubles came to light, Howard logged back into his own Amazon account and saw that 13 new EC2 instances in Oregon had been started—on April 9, days after he learned of $6,000 in fraudulent charges on his account. “Of course I changed my password and disabled my new access key," he said. "This time I didn't even bother creating a new one.” Since he hadn't used the new access key anywhere, or uploaded or shared it anywhere, he was worried. “Whether it's related to Heartbleed is anyone's guess,” Howard said. "It's possible that they still accepted requests with the old access key after I killed it. Perhaps the attacker was notified of the new key somehow. I really have no idea." Amazon: "We've Been Seeing More And More Of This" Later on Friday, Amazon told Howard that the hacker may have used a feature called "Spot Requests" on his account before he reset his credentials. He checked out his account and found many of them. As an Amazon developer, you can bid on unused computing resources via Spot Requests, and when Amazon accepts the price you set, it automatically starts using the designated computing resources. Amazon told Howard he had to check each of Amazon's geographical region for such requests, as deleting one would not affect instances in any other region. "The nefarious way to use this is to set up a ton of requests with a high max price," Howard said. "Even once all the credentials are changed, this request is still present, so new instances continue to be spun up and down over time. This is apparently what happened to me." That's what an Amazon representative told Moreno the day he discovered the breach. The Amazon employee also told Moreno to check his EC2 spot instances in other regions, and predicted he would see high end instances running. Which he did. Like Howard, Moreno changed his password, but took the extra precaution of removing his code from GitHub. That's not a trivial process: Because the way repositories are backed up, his old keys may still be discoverable. A helpful GitHub tutorial explains how to purge files from your repositories permanently and avoid accidental commits in the future. Plugging The Holes Recently, Amazon has changed the way it generates credentials, Moreno and Howard both said. To allow programs to access AWS resources, you used to need an access key ID and a secret access key—strings of characters generated by Amazon. In the past, you could log into your account and retrieve the secret key at any time. That's no longer the case. "If you lose [the secret key], you must disable and generate a new access key," Howard said. An Amazon guide for managing AWS credentials suggests removing, or not generating, an access key for your root account; and using AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) to create temporary security credentials for applications that interact with AWS resources. It also explains how to manage IAM access keys. “We take security very seriously at AWS, and we provide many resources, guidelines and mechanisms to help customers configure AWS services and develop applications using security best practices," an AWS spokesperson said. "When we become aware of potentially exposed credentials, we proactively notify the affected customers and provide guidance on how to secure their access keys.” It seems that Amazon could do more, however. If security researchers can easily scan public sites like GitHub and find access keys, couldn't Amazon do the same, and save itself and its customers from these incidents by immediately deactivating the keys? How To Protect Yourself It may go without saying, but if you've uploaded code to GitHub, you might want to check whether you inadvertently included your credentials for anyone, including hackers, to access. "I'm sure many developers have made the mistake I've made," Moreno said. He and Howard offer the following advice. Use two-factor authentication. Although this would not have helped either Howard or Moreno, additional security through a second type of authentication helps protect email and other accounts which might also hold your cloud keys. Take advantage of it. Never hardcode your cloud computing credentials. Even if you're using a private source-code repository, that may change in the future. You may decide to contribute code to an open-source project, for example. "After looking through my code, I see that I had hardcoded my credentials and then commented out that code, later, when I moved the credentials to a preferences file," Moreno said. But, even that isn't good enough since preferences files are usually checked into repositories with code. Use Identity Access Management. This feature from Amazon lets you create individual accounts that have limited privileges. If you wanted to create an applications that stores its data in S3, you can create an account that only has access to one S3 bucket. "If that app got compromised or those credentials got accidentally checked in to GitHub, then only that particular S3 bucket would be exposed," Howard said. And if that doesn't stop a hack, you'll still want to gather information about what happened. Mogull explained in a post how to take a snapshot and apply forensic analysis to a hack. The most important advice Howard offers? "Don't put your Amazon credentials into source code and then share that source code in a public place like GitHub!" It seems obvious. But it's clear that thousands of developers haven't taken this obvious step.

                                Science has often come to the rescue when it comes to the world’s big problems, be it the Green Revolution that helped avoid mass starvation or the small pox vaccine that eradicated the disease. There is always hope that scientific innovations will help solve global problems. So can scientists help solve the globe’s ultimate problem: eliminate extreme poverty? In two announcements this month, the governments of the US and UK have made a fresh commitment to try. On 3 April, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) unveiled the Global Development Lab, with the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 using technology-based solutions. While not strictly a physical lab, it is an initiative that will bring together universities, the private sector, governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in order to collectively trial new technological tools to fight poverty. This is an ambitious exercise. The funding reflects that, with USAID committing to US$1 billion per year of support. The ultimate aim is seemingly intractable, but the lab and its partners will aim to develop solutions in water, health, food security and nutrition, energy, education, and climate change, all in the space of only five years. Not many days after USAID’s announcement, on 9 April, the UK government announced the launch of the Newton Fund, a £375m pot designed to improve the research capacities of emerging powers such as Brazil, India and South Africa, and in doing so strengthen ties with Britain. This might seem like a lot of investment in scientific innovation for development. But it is not the first time huge commitments have been made. What after publicly-funded science? Previous initiatives such as the Green Revolution, and attempts to eradicate malaria, among others, represent some of the largest global public investments ever made. After World War II, there has been hope that publicly-funded science would cement peace and that technology would become the foundation of the global economy. While the impacts of these efforts have been far-reaching, they have also come with caveats of sustainability, reach and appropriateness. The Green Revolution never really took off in Africa, attempts to eradicate the mosquito as a means to control malaria have stalled, vaccination programmes struggle to gain acceptance in certain parts of the world, and among certain populations (and not just in developing countries). These examples do not represent miracles, technological panaceas, or broken promises. They represent the enormous complexities of the relationship between science, technology and society. New knowledge on its own cannot solve societal problems, innovation does not automatically engage with pressing need, and technologies more often than not do not reach the people who need them. We have since developed a more critical, possibly jaundiced but also more realistic view of the transformational power of science. Universal education, better communication and international collaboration have not only created new platforms for science, they have created new platforms to engage critically with science and recognise the roots of limitations – diseases of the poor have few treatments, crop yields have stagnated, the internet has remained out of the reach of too many. There are limits to science beyond the limits of technical knowledge, and these limits are often shaped by the limits of innovation to engage with problems of development. That is why the Global Development Lab and Newton Fund are not simply new Green Revolutions or vaccine development initiatives. They recognise the central role of innovation. The Lab aims to create a “new global marketplace of innovations”. Entrepreneurs, investors and corporate leaders are given as much emphasis as inventors, academics and research. There is some consternation that some of the private sector partners – such as Coca-Cola, Cargill and Unilever – that will profit from poverty alleviation. Similarly, the Newton Fund will be administered by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), not the Department for International Development (DFID) that is experienced at handling such programmes. However, the larger aim is an urgent one and such initiatives are desperately needed. Even then, it would be wrong to interpret the launch of the Global Development Lab and Newton Fund within a week of each other as some sort of watershed in how we conceive of the nature of innovation within science for development. Rather it is a sign of an already emerging approach. There have been many initiatives over the past few years that have blurred the boundaries of public and private – global product development partnerships such as the International <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Aids">Aids</a></span> Vaccine Initiative fuelled by the emergence of social entrepreneurship as an alternative to “development” (see for example the excellent The Rise of the Reluctant Innovator) and the emergence of innovation hubs in developing countries (for example iHub in Nairobi). These are reshaping the relationship between science, technology and innovation for development. Slow and steady wins Innovation has historically been built on the interaction between public and private sectors, blurring the dichotomies. It would be a mistake to understand them as mutually exclusive. Social entrepreneurship – where profits are ploughed back into solving social problems – should not be seen as a proxy for NGOs, private-sector science should not be seen as the successor of public-sector science, and the market should not be seen as the sole vehicle for international development. We need to think more critically about the relationship between the public and private sector. And we also need to resist the allure of only scaling up. While the Green Revolution and drug development demonstrate the power of scaling up a solution, thinking only in terms of scale risks privileging high-tech, high-risk solutions over simpler, less exciting solutions that deliver in local contexts. The private sector and entrepreneurs are not a like-for-like replacement for international development and local initiatives. There are pressing needs to build infrastructure, support health and education systems and support governance and civil society structures. These are necessary for science to flourish and for technology to transform. The hope is that both the Global Development Lab and Newton Fund recognise these complexities. They are taking on a big problem where in the past success has been slow.

                                A new Global Investment Framework for Women's and Children's Health demonstrates how investment in women's and children's health will secure high health, social, and economic returns. We costed health systems strengthening and six investment packages for: maternal and newborn health, child health, immunisation, family planning, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, and malaria. Nutrition is a cross-cutting theme. We then used simulation modelling to estimate the health and socioeconomic returns of these investments. Increasing health expenditure by just $5 per person per year up to 2035 in 74 high-burden countries could yield up to nine times that value in economic and social benefits.

Those working in paediatric <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> care are now cautiously optimistic. Comparing the landscape with 10 years ago when <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-infected infants faced inevitable death, those born with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> now have access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) so that increasing numbers of children are surviving to adolescence and beyond. Coupled with this progress, the number of new infections has substantially decreased (from 450 000 in 2005, to 260 000 in 2012) because of scale-up of interventions to prevent mother-to-child <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission (PMTCT), resulting in a shift of burden of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> towards older children.

                                NOT so long ago, China looked to be the promised land for crypto-currencies. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and its rivals were traded freely and online exchanges proliferated. On one estimate, China accounted for more than half of the world’s trade in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> last year. Near the end of last year, when its price was above $1,000, more than 100,000 coins were being traded daily on BTC China, a local exchange.Alas, those heady days are gone. Prices have plunged below $500 of late and hardly 2,000 coins are now traded daily on BTC China. According to Bobby Lee, the exchange’s founder, “Most investors have left the market.” What happened? The short answer is regulation.In early December China’s central bank declared that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was not a currency. This slowed its rise, but enthusiasts remained unbowed as the declaration fell far short of the outright ban some had feared. Then regulators forbade the firms that act as middlemen between businesses and credit-card networks from working with the exchanges. That was a more serious blow, but exchange operators found ways round the ban (for example, by using related companies to deal with the payment processors).Rumours now suggest that the...

                                In countries that have based their wealth on production, every discovery and innovation that potentially lower production costs attract very strong attention. Since 2007, the discovery and exploitation of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil have put the USA energy industry back on the track to competitive procurement faced with competing nations who have been low costs champions for decades. The new question on the table is to ascertain whether 3D printing can have a comparable impact. [This is a content summary only.

                                It's understood, the twenty-first century will be the century of robots. And there is a lot of talk concerning a subfamily of these machines: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>.
