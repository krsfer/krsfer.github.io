                                As a public speaker, there's nothing worse than delivering a lifeless, yawn-inducing speech. You always want to leave your audience feeling enlightened, hopeful, and inspired — but that's no easy feat. Here are the five steps to writing a powerful speech that will move your listeners: 1. Consider the audience's needs. The first rule of great speechmaking: consider the audience. "A great speechmaker possesses great tact," says Nick Morgan, speech coach and author of "Power Cues: The Subtle Science of Leading Groups, Persuading Others, and Maximizing Your Personal Impact." "You have to be prepared to speak to a particular audience on a particular occasion. Ultimately, then, a great speech is only partially about you. It's also about the audience and the occasion." Ask yourself: Who is this audience? What does it want? What does it fear? Why has it invited me to speak? What aspect of my message is most relevant to it? "And then ponder the occasion," he says. "What's happening right now that will be on the minds of everyone in the room? What should I not talk about? What does that audience need to hear?" 2. Catch the audience's attention. You need a great hook. "The idea is to frame the talk in the first one to three minutes, in a way that draws the audience in but doesn't simply give them an agenda," Morgan says. "That's boring. No one pays attention during the presentation of the agenda slide, so don't do it." Instead, tell a compelling story — one that shows (rather than tells) the topic you're going to be discussing.  3. Hold the audience's attention for the next 15 minutes. Yes, the very beginning of the presentation is crucial, and your ending can make or break it, too, but everything in between is just as important — and it's imperative that you hold your audience's attention throughout.  Take time to carefully think about how you'll accomplish that. "There's only one way that works reliably, and that involves asking yourself one simple question: What's the problem the audience has for which the information I'm ready to talk about is the answer?" Morgan says. 4. Offer a solution to their problem. Write a speech that addresses the problem and solution. "It's an ancient formula for persuading somebody of something," he says. "Unless you don't want to be persuasive, it's the best structure for a speech. The Greeks invented it more than 2,000 years ago, and it worked well for them. It will work well for you today." 5. Provide a call to action. The best way to finish is to give your audience something to do, Morgan says. Why? "Because you've just forced normally active people to be passive for the better part of an hour, and it's time to let them absorb your message actively. In this way, they'll better remember — and even act on — what you've been talking about." He says the best action step he ever saw was at a charitable event, where the speaker asked everyone to reach into their pockets and grab their loose change. "He said, 'Now hold it out at arm's length.' Once everyone was doing so, he added, 'Now, throw it on the floor.' There were 5,000 people or more in the audience, and the sound was amazing. What's more, the speaker had runners collect the money, and that audience raised literally thousands of dollars for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> in one or two moments." Find something relevant and connected closely to your message. Ask yourself, "What's the next thing I would want my audience to do after the speech is over?" Then, get them to do that, or motivate them to take a step toward that. "The point is that what people do they believe. So if you get them to act, that will reinforce their belief in your message," Morgan says. "The step should be simple, it should only take a few minutes, and it must be relevant to your message," he concludes.  Want your business advice featured in Instant MBA?

                                Sea levels are rising, glaciers are melting, and extreme weather is becoming the norm. The negative effects of man-made climate change are here to stay — and they're getting worse. One of the major culprits is atmospheric carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal. Luckily for the Earth, the world's supply of fossil fuels is limited. And for the past several decades, researchers have been looking for renewable energy resources to provide power to everyone without poisoning the Earth. Some scientists think humans could be getting clean power collected from solar panels in space and beamed back down to Earth in our lifetime, and some industry startups like California-based Solaren are predicting it will be a reality by the end of the decade. Not only would the energy source be continuous, but it would also be clean and unlimited (that is, until the sun explodes). This idea may sound like science fiction, and at one time it was. The concept originated in a short story by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov. Asimov's 1941 story envisions a world where the Earth is powered by a beam of light that draws its energy directly from the sun. The beam is controlled by two engineers in a space station. As the story opens, they are training a robot to take over the operation. The human explains to the robot: "Our beams feed these worlds energy drawn from one of those huge incandescent globes that happens to be near us. We call that globe the Sun ... " The thought of harnessing the power of the sun with giant solar collectors in space was pure fiction 75 years ago. But now, the day of space-based solar power may not be so far away. Terrestrial Solar Power Versus Space-Based Solar Power We typically think of a solar panel on the roof of someone's house converting sunlight into energy during the daytime. Sounds great, but Earth-based solar panels have their drawbacks. They don't work at night or if the sky is too cloudy. Plus, our atmosphere shields the Earth's surface from much of the sun's energy — bouncing some of the light back into space. Now imagine if we could put a solar panel in Earth orbit — around 22,000 miles up. "If you put the solar panel in space, it's going to be illuminated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 99% of the year," Paul Jaffe, a spacecraft engineer at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, told Business Insider. Because the Earth's axis of rotation is tilted, Jaffe explains that "even on the night side of the Earth [the satellite could] be in sunlight almost all the time." Jaffe predicts that individual space-based solar arrays would be able to produce from 250 megawatts to 5 gigawatts of energy. But since the sun is a continuous, renewable resource the "total amount of power that could be produced is effectively infinite," he says. Take New York City, for example, which requires 20 gigawatts of power. By Jaffe's calculation, as few as four arrays [see picture below] — if each provided 5 gigawatts — would be able to power the entire city. The cost to build one space-based solar array is somewhat of an unknown but would likely be hundreds of millions of dollars. But once the first one is manufactured, there would probably be certain economies of scale that could make production of multiple arrays cheaper.  The energy crises of the 1970s propelled the government to look into alternative energy sources as it started to become clear that oil was a limited resource and that its supply cold be subject to the whims of international politics. According to Jaffe, the conclusion at the time by NASA and the Department of Energy regarding space-based solar power technology was that it could be possible, but it would be very, very expensive. In the intervening years, many nations studied space-based solar power, including Japan, China, and several European nations. "A lot of people have looked at this, but there has been a lot less actual development of hardware and the component technologies," said Jaffe. In 2009, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced a series of goals to reduce the Navy's dependence on foreign oil and to increase its use of alternative energy. That same year, Jaffe received funding from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory to improve the technology that would convert the solar energy collected in space into a different form of energy that could be transferred to Earth. How The Technology Works While the technology needs some improvement, the basic idea is pretty clear: The sun sends out photons, energetic packets of light, in every direction. A regular solar panel converts those photons into electrons of direct current electricity. Then, in order to power an electronic device plugged into a wall outlet, the direct current is transformed into an alternating current and sent through the power grid. In space, the big issue is how we would get that power to the grid. With the solar farm in space, researchers needed to figure out the most efficient way to transfer the direct current from the solar reflectors to Earth. The answer: electromagnetic waves, like those used to transmit radio frequencies or heat up your food in the microwave. "People might not associate radio waves with carrying energy because they think of them for communications, like radio, TV, or cellphones. They don't think about them as carrying usable amounts of power," Jaffe said in a statement. Though we do know that microwaves (another subset of electromagnetic waves) carry power — their energy heats up our food! Jaffe calls the technology he is working on the "sandwich" module. The image below shows mirror-like solar reflectors concentrating the sun's photons onto the array of sandwich modules. The top of the sandwich module array receives the solar energy. Antennas on the bottom side beam the radio waves to Earth. The image above isn't to scale. The sandwich modules would be about 10 feet long on a side and about 80,000 would be needed. The array of sandwich modules would be about the length of nine football fields, or more than 1/2 a mile long. This is about nine times bigger than the International Space Station. Back on Earth, the energy-containing radio frequencies from the space-based solar panels would be received by a special antenna known as a "rectenna," which could be as big as six miles in diameter. "It would look like a field full of wires sticking up. The rectenna elements receive incoming radio waves and convert it back from that high frequency radio wave into electricity," Jaffe said. The power beam of radio waves could be sent to a wide variety of locations on Earth, because the direction of the beam can be changed by a method called "retrodirective beam steering." According to Jaffe, "This works by sending up a small 'pilot signal' from the center of the ground receiving station. The satellite sees this signal and adjusts its transmitter to send the radio waves to the ground station." For example, the same beam would be able to provide power to Seattle and redirected to provide power to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. An advantage for the military, as well as civilians, would be that they could build receivers at remote operating bases and locations where it is logistically difficult and incredible costly to deliver diesel fuel. A Giant Beam Of Energy From Space A giant beam of radio waves coming down from space to Earth may sound a little scary and dangerous to most people, like something an alien ship would use to explode a city. But really, you wouldn't even be able to see the radio beam with the naked eye — radio signals are flowing around us at all times. Though these radio signals contain more energy than an AM or FM signal you'd pick up in your car radio, the power density of the signal would still be quite low and wouldn't threaten people, airplanes, or birds that would fly through it. Of course, the technology hasn't actually been tested outside of the laboratory yet, so there's no real-world proof the installation would be problem-free. The biggest impediment so far to space-based solar power isn't safety or regulation or design: It's cost. And this problem affects all parties involved, whether government-, private-, or commercial-funded research. It's hard to say what exactly the full-scale implementation of a space-based solar power system would cost, but it would likely be hundreds of millions of dollars. There is a limit to how big of an object can be launched into space, and strapping the components to rockets doesn't come cheaply. For example, the International Space Station had to be built in space part by part because there wasn't a rocket big enough or strong enough to launch the completed apparatus into space. Jaffe's research was funded by the Office of Naval Research, and he had funding to produce prototypes of one section: the sandwich module, but not to see the project to completion. He also tested the modules in space-like conditions to ensure they could withstand (and continue to work in) the incredible heat of the sun in space, which hadn't been done before. "The work that we did demonstrates the state of the art and suggests the path forward," said Jaffe. He is trying to find sponsors to secure funding for continuation of his project. But he stressed that it is hard to sell long-term energy projects, especially when he can't show people the technology in action, aside from prototypes. He thinks the real motivator will be foreign competition, like in the 1950s when the Russians developed Sputnik and launched the U.S. into the space race. This time it's likely that the Japanese government may launch the technology first. The Path Forward But even without government funding, small startups like California-based Solaren are looking to make space-based solar power a reality in the next few years. Gary Spirnak, CEO of Solaren, had a long career in space engineering for both the government and private industry. He had watched for years as government funding for space-based solar power waxed and waned and private industry seemed to take little interest. Spirnak told Business Insider that he saw a "system problem" he thought he could engineer his way out of by building lighter versions of the prototypes already being tested. And, in 2009, he convinced Pacific Gas & Electric that his design (which is different from Jaffe's explained above but based on similar concepts) for space-based solar power was viable, and they awarded him the "first power purchase agreement in the world for space solar power," meaning that the electricity company would buy the solar energy that he was collecting from space and deliver it to some of their California customers. The original terms of the contract were to provide energy from space starting in 2016. The start date has now been pushed back because of funding issues, but they are just closing another round of $35 million to $50 million, and Spirnak says he expects it to be functioning by the end of the decade. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: An Unconventional Desalination Technology Could Solve California's <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Water Shortage">Water Shortage</a></span> MORE EXTRAORDINARY TECHNOLOGIES: Check out other "What If" posts Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                Tough sanctions imposed on Russia by Europe and the United States will damage the ability of Russian banks and energy companies to raise capital and buy technology. But Russian oil and gas will still flow into Europe. That’s because Vladimir Putin has spent years turning the country into an energy powerhouse, what Sen. John McCain called, “a gas station masquerading as a country.” Russia provides Europe with roughly one-third of its oil and about 30% of its natural gas through state-controlled energy companies, such as Gazprom and Rosneft. Oil is priced globally, but Russia commands high prices for its natural gas due to its control of the market. In 2012, Americans paid 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for natural gas, while Germans paid 9 cents. Russia’s economy is highly dependent on its hydrocarbons — more than 50% of its federal government revenues derive from its energy sector. The country’s overall economy is smaller than that of the U.K. or Brazil, yet President Vladimir Putin has shrewdly made use of the nation’s oil sector to punch above his weight diplomatically and militarily. Now that American and EU sanctions are beginning to pinch and Russia has announced retaliatory sanctions of its own, Putin is facing a host of challenges, including his Russian-backed separatists on the defensive in Ukraine. But his control of the energy market has positioned Russia to ride out the current crisis. Here’s how he’s done it: Taking Control of the Russian Oil Industry In October 2003, Putin arrested Russia’s richest oligarch, Mikhail Khodorovsky, then sold his oil giant, Yukos, for a fraction of its value to the state-controlled OAO Rosneft, now the largest listed oil producer in the world. Khodorovsky’s imprisonment in Siberia brought the rest of the oligarchs to heel, and Putin became the de facto CEO of Russia, Inc. He also moved aggressively to bring Gazprom, the Russian oil company privatized in the 90s, back under government control. By December 2013, Putin apparently felt confident enough in his position to release Khodorovsky after a decade in prison. This month an international arbitration court ruled that Yukos’ dismantlement damaged shareholders, who are entitled to $50 billion from Moscow. But claimants will likely spend more years chasing compensation than Khodorovsky spent in Siberia. Co-opting Germany and Other Rivals In December 2005, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder lost his country’s federal elections. He immediately became chairman of Gazprom. In 2009, when Gazprom cut off gas to Ukraine, the flow to Europe slowed to a trickle as well. As a result, Germany and Russia agreed to build their own gas pipeline, the Nord Stream, under the Baltic Sea, which partially bypasses Ukraine’s pipeline to Europe. Russia’s charm offensive has also meant awarding huge contracts to the German conglomerate Siemens, French arms manufacturers, and some of the world’s biggest oil companies. These deals have helped to mitigate attempts to halt Russia’s hegemony in Europe or impose sanctions. Even as violent clashes took place in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea in April 2014, Schroeder celebrated his 70th birthday in St. Petersburg and was photographed warmly embracing his friend Putin, who he once described as “a flawless democrat.” Punishing the Pawns  In the winters of 2004 and 2006, Russia’s Gazprom severely cut gas supplies to Belarus, a move that helped win the country’s compliance in negotiating gas transfer prices. It’s now a member of the Eurasian Customs Union, Putin’s free trade association of former Soviet republics set up to compete with the European Union. Latvia and Lithuania have been cut off from Russian gas supplies several times as punishment for their alleged mistreatment of Russian minorities or for awarding refinery or construction contracts to European rather than Russian companies. Ukraine and its downstream customers in Europe drew the most severe punishment when gas supplies were restricted in 2006 and 2009. Harrassing Ukraine Russia has tried to control Ukraine — mostly through corruption and intimidation — since the former Soviet republic declared independence in 1991. In December 2014, the Kremlin-allied president Viktor Yanukovych rejected membership in the European Union, against the wishes of most Ukrainians, in favor of joining Russia’s Eurasian Customs Union. When protests erupted, Yanukovych’s forces fired on the crowds. Amid the ensuing chaos, he fled to Russia, leaving a trail of corruption in his wake. In the most recent maneuvers, when Kremlin-allied president Viktor Yanukovych, was deposed and fled the country earlier this year, Russia deployed troops along the border. Separatist movements were fomented in Crimea and the eastern and southern portions of Ukraine, where many ethnic Russians live. (Not coincidentally, these regions contain sizeable oil and gas reserves.) Crimea was seized in February 2014 by Russian-backed separatists who declared allegiance to Moscow. On March 26, 2014, they staged a referendum that supported the immediate annexation of the territory by Russia. In July, having seized Crimea’s territorial waters along with the region itself, Russia announced Gazprom was fast tracking its South Stream pipeline, which will travel under the Black Sea near Crimea. This gas will flow directly to Europe, emptying the Ukrainian pipeline of Russian gas exports. The line will enter Bulgaria, a Putin ally and recipient of massive Russian investment. Although recent events in Ukraine have complicated the project, there’s little doubt it will be completed. Blocking Azeri Gas to Europe An attempt by Western governments to build a 2000 gas pipeline, known as the Nabucco pipeline, from Azerbaijan through Georgia and Turkey to Europe — thereby breaking the EU’s dependence on Russian gas, was put on hold after Russia’s invasion of Georgia, and subsequently ran into financial trouble. Its failure was due, in part, to Russia’s ability to strongarm various Central and Eastern European countries into accepting its South Stream pipeline proposal, thereby making the eastern portion of Nabucco less financially viable, along with other proposed alternatives. In April, to underscore its opposition to any development in the Caspian Sea, Russia launched military exercises involving dozens of ships and gunboats. Moscow and Tehran have also insisted that no other military or naval power be allowed in the region, namely the U.S.  Funding Anti-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fracking">Fracking</a></span> Campaigns In June, the head of NATO made a startling charge: Russia, he said, was secretly supporting NGOs that were opposing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hydraulic fracturing">hydraulic fracturing</a></span> — or <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> — in promising shale oil and gas regions, notably in France, Poland, and Ukraine. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fracking">Fracking</a></span> does present significant environmental drawbacks, including the release of methane and, it’s thought, a risk of triggering earthquakes. The use of natural gas in general, while cleaner than coal, also releases carbon into the atmosphere. Russia has its own reaons for quietly opposing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>, says NATO’s Anders Rasmussen: "obviously to maintain European dependence on Russian gas." What Happens Next In May, a missile attack over Ukraine hit a commercial jet, killing 298 passengers. Putin has denied any Russian involvement, but there seems little doubt that Russian-backed rebels were behind the shooting. The tragedy has convinced Europeans to impose tough sanctions. Last week, Putin countered with sanctions of his own.  Now, the question is who will blink first. In recent days, Russia began massing troops on the Ukraine border, sparking concerns Putin could stage an invasion. Whether or not he does, it’s clear that Europe’s dependence on Russian natural gas is severely limiting its diplomatic options. Having taken care of the competition — Ukraine, Georgia, and Azerbaijan — Putin can enjoy a profitable energy market in Europe for the foreseeable future. Europe without Russian gas would be a very chilly place.   Diane Francis is editor at large with The National Post and a professor at Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Management.

                                The Internet was invented in the U.S., but we don’t have the fastest internet speeds in the world — for that, you probably want to visit South Korea, which offers more than double the average connection speed than here in the U.S., according to Akamai Technologies. Still, if you’re looking for the fastest internet in the U.S., Akamai published a new “State of the Internet” report, which was mapped by Broadview Networks to show the average internet speeds by state. The results are both colorful and insightful. As you can see, Virginia boasts the fastest internet speeds in the country, with download speeds averaging roughly 13.7Mbps. Delaware and Massachusetts tie for the No. 2 spot with average speeds of 13.1Mbps, with Rhode Island, Washington, D.C., Washington, and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> right in that 12-13Mbps ballpark. Utah, Michigan, and Connecticut round out the top 10 states with the fastest internet. The state with the slowest internet speeds should come as no surprise. Alaska internet speeds average about 7Mbps, although Arkansas, Kentucky, Montana, West Virginia, and Mississippi offer comparable service and they’re not nearly as remote as Alaska.

                                The first time Sarah Churman "heard" her own voice, she was 29 years old. She grinned, laughed, and launched into tears. "I don't want to hear myself cry," she said, covering her mouth. Soon came this observation, "my laughter sounds so loud!"   Sarah Churman was born deaf and the day she first heard her voice was the day her cochlear implant was switched on. Her husband filmed her first moments with the device, a video that has been watched more than 20 million times on YouTube. During the week after her hearing was "turned on" Churman learned many things, she told Today.com — that she had a Texas accent, for example, and that her husband snored. Over 36 million Americans have some form of hearing loss, according to John Hopkins Medicine. This loss can be triggered by a variety of factors — including certain hereditary conditions, overexposure to loud noises, or old age — but it often involves damage to the tiny "hair cells" inside the ear. This stops the message of sound from getting to the brain, which is fully functional. About 100,000 people in the U.S. have hearing loss so extreme they've had a special device surgically implanted in their head to help them "hear." This bionic device, called a cochlear implant, captures sounds and sends a version of the "hearing" signal straight to the auditory nerve. The process is emotional and complicated. Unsurprisingly, a cochlear implant has the power to change peoples' lives. The "on" moment "There is a wide range of reactions," the moment that the cochlear implant is turned on, Dr. Howard Francis, Director of John Hopkins Listening Center, told Business Insider. Children often giggle or bury themselves in their parents arms. "Mostly they're a little bit frightened at first, but that doesn't last very long," he said. "They soon find it to be just a whole new avenue of opportunity to discover and explore the world. Then they come to realize they can generate that sound themselves by hitting things and so forth." For adults, Francis said, the on-moment usually generates feelings of hope, though some find it overwhelming. "They've lived in quiet for many, many years," he said. These implants are usually given to those who still have a 60% hearing loss even when using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hearing aid">hearing aid</a></span>s"><span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hearing aid">hearing aid</a></span>s</a></span>, Francis said. YouTube is full of emotional clips from those who have been generous enough to share the intimate moment when their cochlear implant is first turned on. For adults with severe hearing loss, but who have heard before, implants can allow wearers to communicate more through hearing and speaking, Francis said. Those who have been fully deaf their entire lives are less likely to use the device to receive communication signals, but it gives them a better idea of what's happening around them, he said. A brand new sense Those with cochlear implants don't quite hear what we hear. "People describe it as being a bit robotic or Micky Mouse sometimes," Francis said. This is because of the way the implants work. Cochlear implants are electronic devices, part of which are surgically implanted inside the ear. On the external portion, which sits above and behind the ear, a microphone picks up sound while a speech processor then prioritizes which sounds are most useful to the wearer, according to the NIH. A transmitter on the outside of the head sends the sound information to a receiver on the inside that translates that information into electric signals. Those signals are sent to electrodes deep in the inner ear which send them to the auditory nerve. The nerve communicates with the sound-processing centers of the brain, which interpret the signal. This means that cochlear implants "create a simulation of sound," but wearers aren't hearing the sound directly, implant patient William Mager wrote for the BBC. You can hear what it sounds like to have cochlear implants at 3:15 in the video below. A new language Despite the success stories, cochlear implants are not a magic wand which suddenly grants the deaf the ability to hear. For most, the implant is the beginning of a long road ahead. "I think the most important misconception is that there is a learning process, that there is, in fact, work that has to be done to actually become good users of this device," Francis said. Processing and identifying these sounds can be like learning a whole new language. "I have to learn to recognize what these sounds are as I build a sound library in my brain," one 39-year-old woman who had recently gotten an implant told the BBC. "Hearing things for the first time is so, so emotional, from the ping of a light switch to running water. I can't stop crying." William Mager was born deaf. At age 35 he decided to get fitted for a cochlear implant. "There are lots of reasons I wanted a cochlear implant," he wrote for the BBC, "but chief among these was a deterioration in the little hearing I had been born with. Lip-reading was getting more difficult and the world felt like it was receding from me." Mager wrote that his expectations were heavily managed by hospital staff. The switch on is usually the worst day of most people's lives, they told him. They were right. "The first time it was activated, it felt like an electric shock in my head, nothing at all like sound. It affected me so badly I went grey and began to tremble," he wrote. "It was the worst day of my life, just as the audiologist had predicted." Eventually the shocks turned into decipherable sounds, and one month later, Mager could hear sounds he never heard before — T.V., the opening of drawers — and even have his first phone conversation with his mother. "Life with the implant is better than it was with the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hearing aid">hearing aid</a></span>, but also worse" he wrote. Mager noted that it is still difficult to understand people and feel like his "old self." Still, he had hope: "I'm never going to be hearing. I'm never going to stop being deaf. But hopefully this little computer that now lives in my head will make life a bit easier." <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: These Pictures Show How Shockingly Good Bionics In Sports Are Now GAME CHANGERS:  See more in this series.

Look up liver failure, to start, or end-stage respiratory disease. You, in particular, have a reasonable chance of going out via either route, and it will be terrible and have nothing to do with any hot zone.  I don't say this to minimize the abject misery of contracting <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, but to point out that we have a particular lens with regards to the virus, and others of the sort that happen there and not here, and which help keep the average life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa at about half that of what can be expected in America.  A real super-disease is <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, which had 15 odd years of free reign before a real and lasting treatment was developed. Or, rather, it had 15 odd years of free reign in the developed world, while, in Africa, it still more or less does as it damn well pleases, at least compared to the US and other developed nations. In 2012, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> killed around one million people in Africa, which shouldered about 70 percent of the disease's total mortality for the year.  Talk about a bad way to die: an undefended human body, at the mercy of everything from leukemia to thrush. Leukemia is leukemia, but thrush is a fungus that normally just chills around the body's mucous membranes under the watchful eye of a healthy immune system, occasionally erupting as a yeast infection. But as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> progresses to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> (which, thanks to antiretroviral therapy, it doesn't have to) and that immune system falls into a downward spiral, thrush (Candida, properly) might just take over everywhere from the oesophagus to the farthest corners of the lungs. And that's death. Those 15 years were far too many and it's easy enough to speculate as to how different that number would be if <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> attacked predominantly straight couples, just as it's easy to speculate that if <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>'s ground zero were anywhere in the developed world (New York, London, wherever), it would be easily treatable and a vaccine would be on-hand just in case, like so many other illnesses crushed by the focused efforts of an elaborate and well-funded medical establishment. Just in the past week, that establishment has been able to toss out two (so far) promising anti-<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> candidates and it's worth speculating where we'd be if those candidates had been rushed into testing a month or year ago. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, after all, didn't just materialize this summer. Meanwhile, a vaccine looks to be on the way as well. Again, that's not just good timing. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> could easily be a treatable disease with a low mortality rate, which is largely my point. Even without new specialized treatments, if <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> managed to spread throughout the US you would find it rather quickly become a much less scary disease. Consider that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> mortality rate, some very large part of what makes the virus as spooky as it is. That rate is based on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> mostly being contracted in Africa and being treated in Africa. A big part of treating something is supportive care, helping the body deal with its invader while not necessarily going after the invader directly, and good supportive care is dependent on access to a good hospital armed with adequate tools. As for why these potential new treatments are just now making their way into the world, that's easy. Health care follows money. The things people die (young) of in the developing world—cholera, hepatitis, and malaria—are mostly all easy to treat if not eradicate, or they should be. Money on the other hand stays put, and so we get drug companies churning out chemical mirrors of old drugs designed not to treat something new or treat something better, but to reestablish a patent, so that said drug can remain expensive for patients and profitable for the drug company.  Malaria kills millions every year, with a particular preference for young children.    Like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, Malaria could have been wiped off the surface of the planet by now. Maybe <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> and its very public brutality and dark mythos will be a wake-up call of sorts that we're doing something very wrong in allowing this connection between money and not dying in horrible and unnecessary ways to persist. The evidence suggests otherwise, and more likely, the disease will continue on in the popular imagination as some wonder of virulence soon to be eradicated by the quick efforts of benevolent drug companies, rather than a comparatively "dumb" virus that's been allowed to persist because of those companies' disinterest.

                                Liberians read the Daily Talk chalk board on the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak situation in Monrovia. Ahmed Jallanzo/EPA The current outbreak of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is the worst in history. Almost 2,000 people have been infected and around 1,000 people have died. The outbreak seems to have originated in Guinea and has now spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Patients infected with the virus have also been evacuated from West Africa to America and Europe. These developments do not a pandemic make, but the situation has been described as an international public health emergency. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> Hemorrhagic Fever is, as its name suggests, a fearsome thing. The responsible virus causes some very unpleasant symptoms, kills most of those it infects and spreads reasonably easily. To make matters worse there is no known cure or vaccine. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is scrambling to deal with the situation. Emergency meetings have been convened and measures to prevent the further spread of the disease are being implemented. The World Bank has also offered to provide $200m in emergency assistance and the British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help those who have been infected. The WHO has also announced that it will convene a panel of ethics experts to make recommendations about the use of experimental treatments. This follows a controversial decision to give a drug that had never been tested in humans to two American citizens. Convening a panel of ethics experts as a matter of urgency is a relatively unusual step and hints at the depths of concern that exists among medics and bioethicists. What will the ethics panel decide? It is unclear at this stage who will sit on the ethics panel. Nor is it clear what status the panel’s recommendations will have. It is, however, relatively easy to determine the kind of ethical issues the panelists will discuss. In the first instance the panellists will want an accurate summary of the scientific evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of any experimental drugs that might be used in this crisis. They will also want to know about the precise nature of the current <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak. In particular, they will want information about the morality rate, which currently seems to be hovering around 60%. They will need this kind of empirical data because an ethical decision about whether or not to make experimental drugs available cannot be made without a careful analysis of the potential risks and benefits. The panellists' discussions around these issues will be especially intense. This is because the scientific evidence is scant and there is a real concern that one of the fundamental ethical principles of medicine will be violated if the drugs are used and end up causing more harm than good. The ethicists will also want to think about the ramifications of giving people access to experimental research drugs which have not been tested in humans. Drugs that have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities are sometimes given to patients on compassionate grounds when there is no other treatment available. However, this particular decision is being made in the eye of a medical and a media storm. This means that a decision to use experimental drugs in this case could set a dangerous precedent. Normally, new medications have to pass through a rigorous set of clinical trials before they are approved. This is to ensure that the drugs are both safe and effective. Subverting this process may make sense in rare cases. But it is important not to “normalise” this kind of action otherwise the whole edifice of evidence-based medicine will come tumbling down. The principle of autonomy will also loom large in the pannelists' discussions. It will be said that competent patients who are infected with a life-threatening virus should be allowed to make up their own minds about whether or not to take an experimental drug. Others, however, will argue that people who are seriously sick and seriously scared will struggle to process relevant information in a way that enables them to make free and informed decisions. Some will also worry that many of those affected in the current outbreak have little in the way of formal education and thus may not understand enough about biology, medicine or drug experimentation to give informed consent. Yet another issue that will be on the table will be the concept of human rights. A legal right to healthcare is enshrined in a number of international documents, including the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Constitution of the World Health Organisation also states that the “enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being”. However, even if the panellists agree that moral and legal rights to healthcare exist, it is less certain that they will also agree that people have a moral and legal right to experimental healthcare. If the panellists do decide to recommend giving access to experimental drugs they will have to make recommendations about the allocation of what is, at least for the moment, a very scarce resource. Claims that black Africans are being left high and dry whilst white patients from wealthy countries are given access to experimental drugs have sparked much anger. If more drugs are to be made available it is essential that they be distributed in a way that is transparent and fair. Quite what a just allocation of a very scarce resource will look like is not easy to say. Difficult questions about whether to prioritise infected healthcare workers will have to be answered. However, one thing is ethically obvious: access to these drugs should not be limited to Americans. The underlying problem Whatever recommendations the ethics panel come up with the underpinning ethical issue – the gross inequality of global wealth, health and healthcare – will not be addressed. Given the narrow remit of the panel this will be understandable, but it will still be unfortunate. The reason why <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is spreading so quickly and killing so many is because countries like Liberia simply do not have the resources to deal with it. And until the international community drastically reduces the poverty that is both a cause and an effect of ill-health the problems that we are currently seeing in West Africa are going to keep recurring. Fortunately this is not just a matter of altruism. We now live in an interconnected world and thus we are all potentially vulnerable. After all, if there is one thing that is true of communicable diseases it is this: they do not respect borders.

                                Re-fuelling after exercise is important for maintaining adequate energy stores for beneficial changes in your muscles (training adaption).Szabó Varga Katalin/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA Sports performance was once thought to be enhanced by practices such as drinking cognac before an Olympic marathon run. Thankfully, today’s nutrition strategies are more scientific and properly researched. We now know quite a lot about when and what to eat before, during, and after exercise for better performance. Of course, what you eat at all these points plays a role but what you eat to recover after exercise (recovery nutrition) supports the body’s physiological adaptation to the demands of training and competition. And it prepares the body for the next event. It replenishes fuel stores in muscles and the liver, minimises muscle loss and encourages muscle growth and repair, minimises fatigue and injury, and supports immune function. Replenishing fluid is also vital but outside the scope of this article. Re-fuelling after exercise is important for maintaining adequate energy stores for beneficial changes in your muscles (training adaption). But it shouldn’t be in excess of the metabolic demands of what you’ve done if you want to maintain appropriate weight, body composition and support performance goals. Getting <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carbs">carbs</a></span> right Training and competition require energy, and the energy muscles use is supplied by a mix of fuels in different proportions depending on the intensity and duration of exercise. In general terms, carbohydrates are the primary fuel source as exercise intensity increases. The type of carbohydrate used by the body as fuel for exercise is glucose. Consuming carbohydrates before and during prolonged exercise (such as a marathon run) will replenish glucose, delay the onset of fatigue, and allow you to compete for a longer period of time. Glucose is stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen, and research shows low muscle glycogen can impair performance. Depending on when the last carbohydrate meal was consumed, glycogen reserves can be depleted after about 60 to 90 minutes of intense exercise. Planning for glycogen replacement requires adjusting for variations in exercise intensity and duration, the amount of muscle you have, your training goals, and dietary intake at other times, including before and during events. So total carbohydrate targets can vary considerably. Consuming carbohydrates before and during prolonged exercise (such as a marathon run) will replenish glucose, delay the onset of fatigue, and allow you to compete for a longer period of time. ed_needs_a_bicycle/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA Post-exercise carbohydrate recommendations for athletes generally suggest consuming about 1.2 grams of carbohydrate for each kilogram of body weight within an hour of completion, and each hour for four hours after activity. This should be followed by regular carbohydrate intake appropriate to meet daily requirements. Replacing muscle protein But there are also other things you’re going to need to recover properly. What you generally eat and the type of exercise you do can both affect the synthesis of protein in your muscles. Physical training is a stimulus for muscle growth and adaptation. Hard-working muscles come under stress during physical activity, and the body’s limited reserves of amino acids (what proteins are made from) become rapidly depleted. Consuming protein or amino acids after exercise can reduce muscle breakdown and encourage new tissue growth. But here again, individual responses and requirements can vary quite a lot. The type and amount of your protein intake both play a role in muscle reconditioning after exercise, with some evidence suggesting that dairy proteins, such as whey protein, may offer advantages over other sources. But studies are not consistent about ideal timing. Some suggest consumption before exercise while others recommend consumption within 24 hours of completion offers most benefit. Generally speaking, consuming 20 to 25 grams of quality protein as soon as possible after exercise is recommended for building muscle and help reconditioning. Another recommendation is around 0.25 to 0.3 grams protein per kilogram of body mass. Best foods It follows that foods containing both carbohydrates and protein are generally recommended as being best for recovery. And there are other advantages – consuming protein with carbohydrates may improve glycogen replenishment and reduce muscle breakdown. The optimal carbohydrate to protein ratio for glycogen replenishment is three to one. Consuming protein after exercise can reduce muscle breakdown and encourage new tissue growth. Isaac Hsieh/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA In general, moderate to high glycaemic index, low-fibre carbohydrate sources are preferable because they’re digested and absorbed rapidly. And good quality plant- or animal-derived protein foods are better because they contain essential amino acids. The average person exercising at low to moderate intensities for around 30 minutes a day on most days of the week, should follow general dietary guidelines to meet their energy and nutritional needs. But it’s worthwhile trying to adjust mealtimes to coincide with recommended post-workout time (30 to 90 minutes) for eating. Adding an extra recovery meal, or a high-sugar sports drink, will merely increase your risk of consuming more than you need. Specialised nutrition plans are particularly useful for highly active and trained people who engage in moderate to high intensity activity for between two and six hours every day most days of the week. Energy requirements increase at this level and carefully planned nutrient intake and timing will support performance while minimising fatigue and injury. Here are a few examples of foods that may support an athlete’s recovery eating plan, containing protein, as well as approximately 50 grams of carbohydrate: two cups of breakfast cereal with milk, two slices of toast with 220 grams baked beans, a large baked potato with cottage cheese plus glass of milk, 200 grams of fruit yoghurt with 300 grams of fruit, or a bread roll with lean meat or cheese and a large piece of fruit The most important thing to remember is that there is no one size that fits all. Individual nutrition plans are best developed with the help of qualified sports nutrition experts and may involve some trial and error for the best outcome.

                                Tough decision: Barack Obama with the National Security Council.EPA/Pete Souza Barack Obama’s decision to authorise the bombing of the forces of the Islamic State, or ISIS as it is commonly known, in northern Iraq has justifiably caught many observers by surprise. After all, the president has devoted six years to extracting America from military involvement in the region. He has generally preferred to rely on the diplomatic and economic instruments there – whether he is trying to bring Hamas and Israel to the bargaining table or cajole Egypt towards democracy. Under his stewardship, America has relied on the use of force against militants on a comparatively selective basis – mostly through gathering intelligence, espionage and then <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> attacks. So why has he returned to more conventional instruments of war at this point? And what does this action presage for the remainder of his presidency in terms of his Middle Eastern policy? In Thursday’s news conference, the president reassured the American people that this was an exceptional case, limited in its scope and duration. He justified his actions on both humanitarian and national security grounds. Airstrikes are authorised. The humanitarian justification is that the bombing of militants is being co-ordinated with the delivery of aid to tens of thousands of Yezidis trapped by militants on Mount Sinjar and Christians fleeing Qaraqosh. They, the president insisted, face the realistic prospect of slaughter or starvation without American assistance. In his own statement, US secretary of state John Kerry echoed the president’s sentiments. Kerry too uttered the word “genocide” in describing their plight – one regarded as taboo in U.S. foreign policy circles because, once invoked, America is required by its own domestic laws to intervene to protect civilians. The national security justification is the need to protect Iraq’s Kurds. This has been a consistent theme of the four most recent presidents, predating the unseating of Saddam Hussein. ISIS forces have routed Kurdish fighters, seizing towns around Erbil and the strategically important Mosul Dam. They now threaten to overwhelm the retreating and undersupplied Kurdish forces, and to make significant incursions in the Kurdish region itself. This prospect is alarming to both Europe and the US. The Kurds are considered by both to be among the most stable and unstintingly western-oriented minorities in the Middle East. Their part of Iraq has been exempt from the national epidemic of violence and has flourished economically while the broader economy has wilted. Indeed, the West has largely failed to support Kurdish claims for independence only because of broader geopolitical fears that doing so will create even more instability in a fragile region. Representative Adam Smith of Washington State, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, put it succinctly when he reportedly said to a New York Times reporter that: “The Kurds are worth helping and defending.” But Obama has a third concern, one that may outweigh both of these justifications. It is the safety and welfare of Americans living in both Erbil and Baghdad. Until recently, Iraq’s political leadership expressed a breezy confidence that Baghdad was safe from militant forces. That confidence has crumbled – as the result of both its military’s abject performance and the sustained political infighting about the selection of a new government in the aftermath of April’s election. It is very hard to fight a war successfully when the politicians are in disarray and the military are ineffectual. Barrage of criticism Under these circumstances, the president is mindful of the domestic barrage of criticism he faced in the aftermath of the attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi and the resulting death of four Americans. Military intervention at this point does not ensure that Americans in Iraq will be protected. But it limits the possibility of them being captured or killed. That would truly be a political nightmare for the president. The American public isn’t so concerned about the political sensitivities. But – despite broader reservations – the American public will sympathise with any initiative intended to protect their compatriots. Inevitably, Obama has encountered three sources of criticism. The first is from traditional adventurist Republicans who think that the president isn’t going far enough. Republican senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called for more military action and “the provision of military and other assistance to our Kurdish, Iraqi and Syrian partners.“ The second combines those Republicans who generally favour American retrenchment with more liberal peace activists. These two odd political bedfellows consistently demand US military disengagement, suggesting that it is the role of other organizations such as the United Nations to act as the "World’s Policeman” rather than the US. US aircraft went into action against ISIS artillery near Erbil in northern Iraq. EPA/Lorelei Vander Griend Finally, perhaps the most significant source of criticism comes from a variety of Shia and Sunnis in Baghdad. Sami al-Askeri, advisor to Nouri Al-Maliki, is only one of many who vehemently argue that the president is only intervening now because the lives of non-Muslims are at stake. As far as he is concerned, it is the only reason that – in Obama’s own words - “America is coming to help.” The two domestic sources of criticism are a routine part of contemporary American politics. It is this third source of criticism that will potentially have the two most enduring effects. Western ‘crusade’ First, the president insists that this is a limited action, a product of the sectarianism plaguing Baghdad and the resulting inability of Iraq’s leadership to get their political act together. But that claim will likely be treated with distain, not only across the Muslim countries of the Middle East but also within the poor Muslim neighborhoods of Europe that have become a fertile recruiting ground for Islamic militants. Militant leaders have consistently characterised their primary conflict as being with the invading Christian West, even as they have slaughtered fellow Muslims. For them, America’s hasty disengagement from Libya, its failure to act in Syria, and its refusal to take a more aggressive position towards Israeli incursions into Gaza all contrast with its protection of Christian civilians in Iraq. This apparent inconsistency will provide militants with the fodder for their recruitment campaigns. They will inevitably characterise this episode as a one that exposes the West “real” agenda – as crusaders. A second, less obvious consequence may be felt thousands of miles away – in Ukraine. Russian forces used ethnic solidarity and the protection of minorities as a pretext to invade Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008. They claimed the same in the recent annexation of Crimea. With 20,000 Russian forces now camped on Ukraine’s eastern border, Obama’s decision to protect the Christian and Kurdish minorities in Iraq may provide Vladimir Putin with the current precedent to justify a large scale invasion of Eastern Ukraine in defense of what he has characterised as its oppressed minority. The president’s domestic support for his limited military action in Iraq may be fully justified on humanitarian grounds. But the shallow support it enjoys at home will become even thinner if it gives Putin the excuse to launch a military offensive. Once again, the Middle East ably demonstrates the complexities of international politics – and that none of the options are good ones, even for the most well-intentioned of policymakers.

                                US doctor Kent Brantly.Samaritan's Purse The treatment of the two Americans with an experimental drug after catching <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in West Africa has raised all sorts of ethical implications that will be addressed by a meeting of experts convened by the World Health Organisation next week. Neat scientific tricks Since the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak began in February more than 900 people have died. There are no antiviral drugs – the only treatment is with fluid and other supportive measures. Zmapp, the drug given to the two US doctors, is a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies that incorporates some neat scientific tricks that bring together human, mouse, and plant biology. The antibodies are made by infecting a mouse with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus, and then isolating the immune cells; each of these produces a specific antibody protein against part of the virus. The one cell that produces the best antibody is grown up into a group of identical cells, called a clone, which is why the drug is said to be “monoclonal”. Tobacco plant. Bambo, CC BY-NC-SA Although they are effective at neutralising the virus, these antibodies have to be modified, or “humanised", so that they are similar to human antibodies and can work with the human immune system. These changes are made by altering the DNA of the genes which produce the antibody proteins. These genes are then injected into a tobacco plant, Nicotiana, which subsequently produces large amounts of the antibody protein. So far in experiments the drug has shown some effects against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> when used to treat infected monkeys. Normally further drug development for humans would take years but in emergency situations like this when the death rate from a disease is especially high, drugs can be used on a compassionate basis without the full set of supporting data. No conspiracy here So why was the drug available for the two Americans, but not for any of the hundreds of Africans that have already died? The internet is full of conspiracy theories and outrage, but the truth is a lot less exciting. Those responsible for the Americans simply heard about the drugs, and convinced the developers, themselves, and the two patients involved that it was worth the risk of trying them, even though they had never been used before. The Nigerian authorities have been told that because such small quantities of the drug exist currently, it will not be available for widespread use in Africa. One of the main problems in controlling the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in Africa has been convincing poorly educated villagers to follow the tried-and-tested approaches that we know definitely help, namely isolation and fluid treatment. As researchers from our institute in Liverpool have found during this outbreak, people are anxious, and frightened; they are mistrustful of the strangers dressed in space suits who take their loved ones away, don’t allow them to visit and don’t even allow them to see the body once they have died. Imagine if scientists had also wanted to also give them an experimental treatment never before used in humans. There would have been even more chaos. The medical and scientific communities have been criticised in the past for trialling <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> drugs in Africa that had not been used in the West. The accusation that Africans are just used as guinea pigs to test drugs for Western benefit is too easy to make. Trialling new drugs The two American patients appear to have improved on the drug, but it is impossible to know whether this is because of the drug itself, or because they were going to improve anyway. Controlled trials, where half the patients get the drug, and half get a placebo, called Phase III studies, are needed to determine whether any new drug is effective. Sadly, the scientific and medical communities have failed to conduct any such trials for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, despite the fact that there are several drugs in development, and promising treatments have been used on a compassionate basis before. However, those who attack the pharmaceutical industry for their “selfishness” are missing the point. No drug company would, in isolation, invest millions of pounds in developing a drug which might be only be needed every few years for a few hundred of the world’s poorest people. Instead a concerted effort is needed to develop partnerships which link academics, industry, African governments, and the major funding agencies. Such approaches have worked in the past for malaria and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. Even with financial investment, taking <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> drugs forward will be challenging. The normal steps for drug development include early testing in healthy volunteers to look for side effects, then dose-optimising studies, before finally seeing if the drug is really effective. All of this occurs in a highly regulated fashion, which makes even the most simple trial of a well-known drug in a common disease extraordinarily laboured and expensive. Regulatory hurdles For an unpredictable sporadic disease, with high mortality rates, we need a flexible approach to our clinical trials framework that cuts through some of the normal regulatory hurdles. Why worry about minor side effects in healthy volunteers, if the drug is to be given to those who will die without it? Why waste time on dose-finding studies when people need the highest dose possible, today? We have to stop applying the over-laboured regulation that characterises routine clinical trials to emergency outbreak situations where they are just not appropriate. Many years ago I led a study to try a new anti-viral treatment for another dangerous emerging infection – the mosquitoes-borne brain disease Japanese encephalitis. We established the trial in a few weeks, at almost no cost beyond the drug itself, and completed the study over the subsequent months. In today’s inappropriately regulated environment such research would simply not be possible. The current <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak is devastating for those affected, and worrying for the rest of society. But if it focuses minds on developing new drugs and vaccines, and establishes a new regime for how we do this, then some long-term benefit may come to everyone, including the most vulnerable in Africa.

                                Getting ready.Theglobalpanorama, CC BY-SA The current epidemic of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, which started in March 2014, has reached Lagos, the most populous city in the most populous country in Africa. This is a huge concern. And while Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO has called for international help for “fragile” West African health systems unable to cope with what it has declared an international public health emergency, it’s clear that the Nigerian authorities could have done much more to prepare for it. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is spread through contact with fluids of an infected person who is showing symptoms. But the virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days so knowing who is infected is difficult. Patrick Sawyer, the first ever recorded case of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in Nigeria, died after flying in from Liberia and there are now seven other deaths related to his case. The WHO has stopped short of recommending a general travel ban, but British Airways has cancelled connections to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Does this go far enough? Ample time On a recent live radio programme in Zaria, northern Nigeria, last month a caller asked me whether they should be worried about the fact that one <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> case had been diagnosed in Lagos. I reassured the caller against panic and advised on general precautions that should be taken. But deep inside I knew that, with the way public health emergencies are handled in Nigeria, it would be all too easy for the disease to find its way to other parts of the country and become a national problem. It’s likely to be just a matter of time. Nigeria had ample time to prepare for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> but it did little about this right up until the moment Patrick Sawyer, the first ever recorded case in the country, came to Nigeria and collapsed in a Lagos hospital. This was a man whose sister, with whom he had close contact, had died of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> and who had reportedly been under surveillance by Liberian authorities. We’ve been carrying out investigations into the outbreak and it’s likely he knew he had the disease. It is worrying that the free movement of people within the West African sub-region remains unrestricted. Nigeria has installed infra-red detectors and set up quarantine procedures for suspected passengers at our international airports; but our borders are notoriously porous and a lot of people travel between Nigeria and other West African countries by road. A corpse was hazardously transported from Liberia to Nigeria. News reports demonstrate that people continue to move freely in and out Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. And people simply deny contact with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> cases to avoid quarantine. People have even dumped corpses by the roadside in Liberia to avoid association with an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> victim. In order to forestall a disaster, the Saudi government has banned pilgrims from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from this year’s hajj. I think Nigeria should be included in this list even though the WHO in Nigeria encourages the screening of all out-bound travellers to prevent exporting the virus. Right now I do not know of any health facility with a ward or room that has adequate isolation facilities for epidemic-prone infectious and severe diseases such as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>. This is despite the fact that every year we have outbreaks of the equally deadly viral haemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever. These outbreaks are often attended by the spread to and death of health workers and other patients. We also have limited capacity to carry out laboratory tests when timely diagnosis is of the essence. Only two labs in the most populous country in Africa are capable of diagnosing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> and are both located in the south-west. By August 6, seven primary contacts with Sawyer – including doctors and nurses – had tested positive and one nurse has died. The driver who picked up Sawyer at the airport fled to Port Harcourt, another city in the deep south of the country. We managed to get him to Lagos this week to interview as part of our outbreak investigations and his status is yet to be determined. Not all of his close contacts have been traced so far. The government has been very slow in responding to the presence of the disease in Nigeria. Even the Emergency Operations Centre, which should be co-ordinating control activities is yet to take off. The health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, said on August 6 that each of the 36 states in the country would set up isolation facilities. I know that’s going to take another couple of weeks. And the situation is not helped by striking doctors. Chukwu has also declared an emergency and specifically asked the United States to help with the Zmapp treatment which seems to be helping the American doctors, although the US has said that even if it proves safe and effective in trials, it wouldn’t be available for at least several months. The WHO has convened a special meeting to discuss the implications of using experimental drugs and some <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> experts have called for the treatment be made available to Africans.

                                JUDGING from the condemnation, Facebook just “friended” Satan. The company has been pilloried for academic research it published, showing that by adjusting its users’ news feeds so that a greater proportion of positive or negative items appeared, it could nudge people to post slightly sunnier or gloomier items themselves. For sociologists, the study provided evidence of “social contagion”—the spread of ideas and moods through imitation and conformity—without face-to-face contact.That Facebook runs similar tests all the time for commercial reasons—to get users to linger longer, or to click on ads—was largely lost on the critics. And the most telling bit went unnoticed: the difference in posting behaviour was between 0.04% and 0.1%. It sounds paltry, and is. But to Facebook’s data scientists, it amounted to a smashing victory. “Given the massive scale,” they noted, “even small effects can have large aggregated consequences.”This may indeed be the unspoken secret of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>.

It is already used in logistics, communications and training, with expected effects on number of staff and productivity. The gradual integration of robotics will affect the safety of operational troops and combat on the battlefield. It will also raise... [This is a content summary only.
