                                The tower in the image above might look like art, but the strange 30-foot gourd shape is an incredibly practical device that can pull water out of the air — up to 25 gallons a day. The tower, called the Warka Water, works even in the desert and costs less than $700 for materials. The beauty of the structure is its low-tech simplicity. The Warka Water, a product from Architecture and Vision, is biodegradable and can be set up without mechanical tools in less than a week. The primary ingredients are bamboo — which can be bought or harvested where local conditions allow — and mesh, Architecture and Vision Director Arturo Vittori told Business Insider. "Once locals have the necessary know-how, they will be able to teach other villages and communities to build the Warka," Vittori told Tuan C. Nguyen on Smithsonian.com. Vittori created the Warka with Andreas Vogler. How It Works Each piece of the structure has a purpose. The exoskeleton of each Warka is made of bamboo and is designed for stability and ease of airflow. Inside the exoskeleton is a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mesh net">mesh net</a></span>, designed to attract water condensation. Once collected, the droplets of water make their way down the mesh to a container at the bottom. The water that is collected is drinkable as is, as long as the local air conditions are not too polluted, said Vittori. Exactly how much water is produced depends on seasonal and climatic conditions such as humidity, wind, and temperature difference. The Warka Water is not the first mesh device designed to harvest water from the air, but it may be the most economical. It creates more water at a lower cost than its predecessors, according to Nguyen. Providing Needed Water In certain parts of rural Ethiopia, obtaining drinking water means a six-hour journey. Constructing a well close by often requires drilling a 1,600-foot hole — an expensive undertaking. "We can say a Warka could provide drinking water for a small rural community of 40 inhabitants," Vittori said, pointing out that that number would vary based on climate. Vittori hopes each one will last four to eight years with regular maintenance, but they're still doing tests. The Warka has held its own in field tests, providing more than 25 gallons of water in a day. Because it relies on temperature differences between day and night, it can collect water in the desert, where that difference can be extreme. It should get even cheaper as components are mass produced, Vittori said. Maintenance requires only that the mesh and container are cleaned regularly and broken parts are fixed. The towers aren't available yet. They're still in the testing phase. "We are looking for funding to complete the design phase and built three or four test structures in different parts of central Africa," said Vittori. The testing phase should cost less than $280,000 to complete, he said. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: With This Robotics Program Thriving In Public Schools, It's 'Cool To Make Mistakes Again' Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                Facebook has been on a shopping spree in 2014. It’s looking to buy a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> company so it can bring the internet and Facebook to the remaining 6 billion people on Earth who aren’t already using it, and its acquisition of Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset firm, is aimed at making your friending, liking, stalking and humble bragging more experiential. Now it seems the company is in discussions to purchase a London start up which has expertise in online payments. It is this creeping interest in financial technologies that should worry us more than <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s or our friends turning our chats into their virtual reality. If everything goes to plan, Facebook users will apparently be offered the chance to store and transfer money on the site, rather than having to use a service like PayPal. Facebook reps are said to have been in talks with several London-based peer-to-peer money services that could make Facebook payments a reality. One of these is Transferwise, a company that recently hit a quintessential target for a scaling tech company when it announced that it had processed £1 billion in user payments. Another possible candidate, Dublin-based CurencyFaire, has also hit the billion mark, albeit in dollars. So long, middle man The convergence of social media and financial services should be seen as a profound shift in how people view, save, use, and are freed of their capital. And Facebook’s interest could mark a tipping point. Social media is being used as a gateway drug to get users hooked onto much more pernicious forms of socio-technical circuitry and economic capture. Why would Facebook sell vague social analytics about our activity to advertisers when it could go directly to our wallets? This is the ultimate “disintermediation” or cutting out of the middleman. Capitalism requires fluidity – the transformation of static objects into cashable objects. By making money social and digital it becomes more fluid. And since social media corporations are already learning how to turn individual users into liquid assets, the mix is all the more potent. Fluid money and personal data pools in centralised servers owned by the millionaires and billionaires of Facebook and Google. Facebook apps for asset management will not be designed for the financial elites whose wealth is already governed by a well-paid professional managerial class. While the discourse is about empowering the working and immigrant poor to be able to send money home without costly fees, it is really about financialising a new market, the formerly private acts that are being unlocked by social media. The privatisation of our lives is already booming. Visit AirBnB to rent out your home, Girl meets Dress to rent someone else’s high-end clothes, WhipCar to borrow someone’s car, Rent My Items to get your hands on their power tools, or Microworkers to rent minutes of your day to do small time work for menial pay. This is financialisation masked as the “sharing economy" but at least we get to rent a nice dress or go on holiday as a result. Facebook has been successful in inviting us to volunteer our free digital labour in producing one of the world’s most valuable companies. Some lovingly call this “participatory culture” while I and others call it exploitation. Facebook can capture additional users by raining down wifi from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s and by making a scroll through bachelor party pictures more immersive with 3D goggles, but these markets will be small time in comparison to the financial market of online payment and banking. This is an explicit attempt to transform the means of our digital sociality, our online public sphere and agora into a mall, a bank, a bazaar. If Facebook is successful, users will rarely leave the site. They will forgo the dangers of the wider internet for the safe comforts of our gated virtual community where we are safe to self-promote and shop till we drop. Or worse, this is an attempt to “gamify” money management. It will be Farmville for personal finance or 3D Candycrush for cash. This sounds stupid because it is. It represents the transformation of a complex system into a simple one. The more our social life is monitored and then digitised, the easier it is to hoard, gamify, and monetise any profitable crumbs. This will not result in more agency but less. Banking is based on hard-to-understand calculations but it is regulated. Add complex filtering algorithms and financial technological derivatives to the picture and no sane person will understand what is happening to their money. Online payment isn’t the problem. Facebook, Google, and others who monopolise and monetise our digital lives on closed centralised systems are. The financialisation of our private lives as well as unwarranted, indiscriminate, illegal, bulk surveillance flourish in these spaces where corporations and governments gain direct access to our private lives. What we need is a social movement to demand an information commons, decentralised servers, and digital literacy along with so-called financial literacy. We don’t need to hand Facebook yet another key to our private spaces.

                                The Conversation organised a public question-and-answer session on Reddit in which Jeremy Pritchard, senior lecturer in biology at the University of Birmingham, explained the science of evolution and tackled the contentious issue of science and religion. Here are curated highlights. Evolution What do you find to be the most difficult challenge to evolution to explain to a layperson? Probably avoiding implying (intelligent) design and therefore purpose. The great fit of adaptations to function often leads us to use language that doesn’t help get to the fundamentals. For example, a bird’s wings are not designed for flight, well they may look designed but they are there because birds' ancestors that had less efficient wings got eaten or get less food and therefore left fewer descendants. The other thing that is tricky to explain is getting over the fact that individuals don’t evolve, populations do. The phrasing used in discussing evolution often implies action from the subject, when in reality the subject has no active role in the evolutionary process (as in the Lamarckian view falsely pushed by some). How much does this figure into your experience? I think this is a big issue. It harks back to Lamarckian views and even ideas of progress and the Greek Great Chain of Being, implying there is some sort of hierarchy in nature, that some things are better than others (whereas in reality all species alive today are equally successful). It is part of the idea that organisms are active in their own evolution. It comes back to my previous comment that it is not individuals that evolve, but populations though the process of differential survival. How does evolution apply to humans in a modern context? Steve Jones of University College London is adamant that we are no longer evolving. Differential survival and differential reproductive success are no longer as much to do with our genes and more to do with how we are able to control out environment. Our “complex intelligence” is, however, a genetically programmed adaptation that allows us to do this. The transmission of ideas and adaptations will be more through cultural rather than genetic means. There are still examples of evolution in human populations. Resistance to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDs">AIDs</a></span>, for example, changes the gene pool as some die and some survive. However further speciation is unlikely as the global human population is largely mobile and interconnected, isolation of gene flow for any length of time is unlikely. What evolutionary adaption do you find most astounding? The mind/behaviour altering adaptation of parasites is great: as they manipulate their primary and secondary hosts so than one eats the other and the parasite life cycle goes on. There must be quite a few, but what is your favourite example of evolution that you use in your teaching? A recent really nice one comes from the lab of John Colbourne at the University of Birmingham. They have provided Jurassic Park-like evidence for evolution using resurrection biology. They are able to reanimate dormant water fleas (daphnia) that are more than 1,000 years old and show how modern populations have evolved to deal with phosphorous from the agricultural revolution of the middle ages. Creationism Why do you think the tension between creationism and evolution teaching exists? I think creationists have a problem. If they accept the bible as literally true then it leads them to reject the conclusions of science, which are evidence-based. Science cannot incorporate random supernatural interventions into the natural world. If you teach this as a possibility, then predictions and extrapolations are no longer possible. You can’t trust the data. I think understanding of the issues in creationism can be useful to science but it has to be about ideas and history, not the process of science. I suspect that for the more radical creationists it is a matter of faith, and faith is something you can use in the face of contrary evidence. Maybe they want to teach it because their God tells them they have to. In my mind there is no conflict: science is about evidence and evaluation of facts, religion is about faith and revelation. Why do you think this ‘debate’ has become such a heated topic? I think the conflict between science and creationism need not be aligned with any conflict between science and religion. The latter can co-exist but the former cannot. Religion is a personal thing. Science is a series of testable facts that give us a theory of how the world works and can be modified or altered as new facts or interpretations come along. Any scientific theory is testable and can be disproved including evolution. Experiments cannot be done to disprove a faith-based situation such as creationism. We are guilty of presenting science as somehow complete (although I think the media’s lack of knowledge about how we deal with uncertainty in science is partly to blame). Not knowing something is a strength of science, it is after all a process not a body of knowledge. Why do you think that it is so hard for many other Christians to find and follow a similar line of reasoning to reconcile the perceived expanse between their faith and evolution/history of the universe? The bible comes from a long tradition of Jewish allegorical story telling and isn’t meant to be taken literally. I think the issue is with people who have entrenched fundamental positions. Why it has to be an either/or situation, I don’t know, maybe it depends how they came upon their belief system.

                                Among the many changes currently sweeping through US public universities is a move away from traditional seat-time in class. Known as “competency-based education”, it is often done online, asking students to demonstrate they can meet certain core skills or competencies. Its proponents offer it up as a cure to the ills that are allegedly facing higher education today, such as underprepared students, the “skills gap” and the general “academic drift” of the university. Those against it are worried the end result will be a university education that will be cheaper in all senses of the word, but also one that is highly stratified and unworthy of the label “higher education”. Recently the push towards competencies has become linked with a movement called the “college completion agenda, which seeks, in part, to allocate public funding to universities depending on how many students finish college. Advocates, including president Barack Obama, argue it is urgently needed to move more students through higher education. Quicker through the system The Gates Foundation and Complete College America claim the completion agenda is urgently needed to get people to finish their degree faster, cheaper and with less student loan debt. It is meant to increase jobs and spur innovation in the intensified competition of the global knowledge economy. Those in favour include a rather motley amalgamation of edu-metricians in fields such as educational psychology who have been dreaming about rationalising and standardising education since the days of American psychologist E.L. Thorndike. Joining them are a variety of neoliberal think thanks, such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, who have longed to turn the market loose on one of the last holdouts of the now greatly diminished public realm. Also in favour are philanthropic groups such as the Lumina and Gates Foundations that have essentially become political action committees by another name. Finally a host of edu-preneurial companies, such as Pearsons, Udacity and others, who are hoping to be on the ground floor of the “edu-metrics” and “credentials” market in the making. Alongside them are various business interests groups who want to avoid on-the-job training costs by capturing universities and turning them into large corporate training centres. They contend that if we could only precisely define what students need to know, it would be possible to accurately measure “learning outcomes” through standardised assessments rather than relying on time spent in class. Students could then move through these at whatever pace they choose. Cheap and substandard Those who oppose this model contend that this is not education at all but simply a cheap, substandard means of providing students with credentials. With these learning outcomes in place, a large data system could be used to move entire degree programs to a competency-based model where each student would be required to meet certain measurable competences as defined by the skills needs of a business. Government would come in to help mandate the partnerships working through the boards of various university systems. Adopting such an approach would allow education to become “personalised” as students check off various knowledge and skills and receive their credential or badge. Such a process can even be done with few or no professors, such as at online universities like Western Governors University (WGU), Southern <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> University’s “College for America” or Capella University’s “FlexPath”. Students, or “education pioneers” in Capella’s adventurous sounding euphemism, who “attend” these universities will then be responsible for navigating their way through these standardised competencies. The new job of professors in this model – or “course mentors” in the eduspeak of WGU – is to develop the standards and competencies and measure students, not necessarily to teach. Indeed, teaching has no real place in this model. While the completion agenda seems to have burst onto the US higher education scene only in the past few years, the move towards competencies and away from seat-time actually has rather deep roots. It dates back to the “behavioural objectives” push in teacher training programs in the US and in vocational training reforms the UK and Australia. Students at risk While the convergence of these two reforms in the US is relatively new, they have been fuelled by a third process that has been unfolding more slowly over the last few decades – the transformation of the student into the consumer. Because of the unrelenting pressures of market forces, these students will be solely responsible for assuming the risks of their own education. Here, education is viewed as an individual investment in a person’s own human capital rather than an expenditure by society for the collective good. The result of this transformation is the creation of a “scared straight” student consumer who is forced to live in constant fear of accruing large amounts of debt, selecting the most lucrative major and finding a good job. From the student’s vantage point anything that appears to “slow down” education is considered a “waste of time and money”. Today, public higher education in the US seems to be facing the proverbial perfect storm. Those pushing the completion agenda want to crank out new graduates as fast as possible to fill a skills gap that is actually a jobs gap. Ironically, the very processes that are thought to be finally bringing market discipline to what neoliberal reformers consider to be the much too public, public university will end up pricing those very reforms as “cut-rate merchandise”. Such a realisation may come too late to preserve public higher education in the US. As higher education systems around the world begin to converge around neoliberal models of reform and open up to more online and private forms of higher education, the US model may soon become a global exemplar. In the end these reforms may either privatise higher education completely or turn it into a self-funded servant of national economic and business interests that is public in name only. Steven C.

The three main groups affected are those with a direct sensitivity to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>, coeliac disease and people who are allergic to wheat. Although symptoms can appear similar and the terms are often used interchangeably, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance isn’t the same as coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is a serious life-long autoimmune condition of the small intestine, in which the body’s immune system attacks itself when someone with the condition eats <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>. This damages the healthy lining of the small intestine and stops nutrients being absorbed from food. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Gluten">Gluten</a></span> intolerance is also a permanent condition that damages the small intestine every time <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> is consumed, regardless of whether symptoms are present or not, but it is unclear whether the immune system is involved. Identifying the active protein In 1887, British doctor Samuel Gee was the first to make a record of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance, which he described as a “malabsorption of ingested food” in children. Removal of wheat flour and wheat products from the diet was later seen to alleviate symptoms associated with the disease – and to this day a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> free diet is currently the only successful treatment. It was later found that a particular protein in wheat was active in patients with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance and could not be removed from the gut by digestive enzymes. Equivalent proteins in rye, barley and possibly oats were also found to cause problems. So foods and drinks containing malted grains and any processed foods that contain this protein have to be removed from the diet. The main cause of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance is genetics, and the specific genes associated with the condition have been isolated. The genes produce molecules that interact with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> proteins and activate the abnormal intestinal response. But not all people with the offending genes develop <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance, which suggests that other environmental factors are implicated. These could include early weaning onto solid food, breast feeding and gastrointestinal infection. Symptoms in untreated conditions can vary which can lead to delays in diagnosis. Symptoms vary from fatigue, headaches, abdominal complaints, diarrhoea, joint complaints to vitamin and mineral deficiencies, such as iron and calcium. Bones can become weak and brittle. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Gluten">Gluten</a></span> intolerance is also associated with other autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid and liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease. An increased risk of intestinal cancer is also associated with undiagnosed <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance. Neurological conditions are also associated with. How common is <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance? Over the past two decades the perception of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance has changed from being a rare disease that affects children of northern European ancestry, to a very common condition of people of all ages worldwide with 1.4 million Americans being diagnosed with the condition every year. The condition recently received high profile coverage in the media after a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free diet was shown to have improved the performances of top sports stars. Recent studies have shown the condition isn’t just confined to western countries or those of northern European descent – <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance, for example, is as common in the Middle East. Despite it now being seen as more common, the condition is under-diagnosed for a number of reasons. Often individuals display only mild symptoms, and even though new and more accurate techniques have been introduced diagnosis still depends on determining changes in cells lining the intestine. Because of this it often takes until adulthood to be diagnosed, in fact, more than 60% of newly diagnosed patients are adults, with 15–20% over 60 years of age. Food for thought The only known effective treatment for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> intolerance is a life-long <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free diet. But studies have shown that some groups, such as adolescents, find it difficult to keep off <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> products. Poor product information on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> containing foods is also be a problem for people on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> free diets, as is cross contamination when food is being made. Useful labelling isn’t always helpful because people differ in their sensitivity to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> so a particular dose may cause a response in one person, but not in another. The availability and price of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> free foods is another factor, often there are limited ranges and are considerably more expensive than conventional products. So in patients on a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free diet, intestinal damage can continue to happen even if in small increments, and may be outside the control of the person with the condition. The use of starches and gums is the most widespread for mimicking <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> when making <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free bakery products, because they have <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> like properties. Some on the milder end of the intolerance scale may not see that having some <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span> every now and again is a problem, while for others it’s a battle to maintain a completely <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gluten">gluten</a></span>-free diet. But the signs are things are getting better – both in terms of diagnosis and available foods on the market.

                                Most of us are only too aware of the seemingly intractable problems we’re facing within healthcare, education, community building, environmental sustainability and regional conflict. But could interactive games provide part of the solution? The organisers of the 11th annual Games for Change Festival in New York (April 22-26) seem to think so. In conjunction with the Tribeca Film Festival, the festival will unite game creators, policy makers and educators. “Gaming for social good” – the use of digital games or elements of games for non-entertainment purposes – is a large arena that includes serious games, game-based learning, games with a purpose and gamification (or game thinking and mechanics in a non-game context). Research from the last decade has shown that, in the right context, games can provide an effective and engaging medium that allows us to explore personal identity, actively participate in learning, build social connections and take part in problem solving and decision making in a “safe-fail” space. Well-designed social-good games can produce positive outcomes by tapping into our intrinsic motivations and positive emotions. There are games that tackle social issues, such as Darfur is Dying, which raises awareness on the plight of refugees in western Sudan; FreeRice, which provides a sponsorship platform for tackling world hunger; and RecycleBank, which encourages household recycling and waste reduction. Darfur is Dying. Screenshot The use of digital games for non-entertainment purposes is nothing new. Its origins can be traced back to the early 1950s with the introduction of the first computers, when chess and checkers were programmed as computer games by scientists to run research in computer science and artificial intelligence. But it was only when the the Cold War took hold that significant investment in digital games was made by the military to simulate war games for training and battle strategy evaluation. Today, outside of the military, investment in games for social impact are undertaken by universities, philanthropic foundations and governments in conjunction with private sector organisations, and supported by advocacy organisations such as Games for Change and Games for Health. In the healthcare sector, games have been used across diverse fields such as research, rehabilitation, medical treatment, education and training. And from these, the following are some pertinent examples. Health and wellness games Medical research The University of Washington developed the multi-player online puzzle game FoldIt in 2008, which focused players on predicting the behaviour patterns of protein structures with potential applications in the treatment of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> virus, cancer and Alzheimers disease. Screen shot of Foldit. Courtesy of University of Washington. billmcclair The problem of how to configure the structure of an enzyme, M-PMV retroviral protease – a challenge that had stumped scientists for 15 years – was solved in just 10 days after it was presented to 240,000 FoldIt players in 2011. This has been a keystone example of how the combination of a multiplayer games, crowd-sourcing and distributed computing can be used as a new and innovative form of collaborative research and problem solving. FoldIt spawned other medical and healthcare game projects, including cancer research with games such as the GeneGames, EteRNA, EyeWire and Phylo. Rehabilitation Videogames using virtual reality have been used in clinical trials for the rehabilitation of stroke patients to recover function in their disabled limbs. Both the Fruit Ninja game on Xbox Kinect and virtual tennis games on the Nintendo Wii platform were found to show significant benefit to patients and act as a good adjunct to conventional therapy. There are now several iPad game apps on the market designed to assist with rehabilitation, communication and emotion management, including a wide range of games for stroke patients. Medical treatment Various games have been used as assistive tools for patients to manage their illnesses (while collecting data at the same time to further medical research). The mobile game Pain Squad was developed to help young cancer patients record their pain levels, and Re-Mission was also aimed at young cancer patients to help them manage their condition better and encourage them to adhere to their treatments. Lymphoma mission on Re-Mission videogame. Healthcare games of this type been successful as they provide immediate feedback and visualisation of the patient’s condition in a novel, interactive and fun way. Most importantly (depending on the game, the illness and the individual) gameplay helps the patient feel empowered, and in control of a situation that more often than not makes them feel isolated, depressed and helpless. Many other games or gamified tools are used, such as Triage Simulator, for training medical practitioners on emergency response, and gamified mobile apps that focus on building exercise, diet, awareness of substance abuse and behaviour modification. Triage Trainer prototype. It’s still early days in the research and testing of games for social impact. Not all problems can be solved with a game-based solution, and any use of games must of course be undertaken as part of an integrated approach. But with increasing pressure on the health system, alongside greater focus on prevention and self-managed care, games are showing strong potential as an innovative source of cost-effective and accessible solutions – just as they are in many other areas of social concern.

                                The idea of using satellites to monitor wildlife and biological diversity probably conjures up images of radio-collared deer or tagged turtles. And while these have been key to increasing our understanding of animal distribution worldwide, we can track a lot more from space than you’d imagine – and it’s not necessary to capture and fit a tracking device first. For example, hyperspectral sensors – which capture information across the electromagnetic spectrum in very narrow bands able to detect recognisable “fingerprints” of objects – have been used to determine genetic differences in Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen), one of the most widespread and genetically diverse species in North America. Satellite information on climatic conditions and on vegetation type and dynamics can help predict animal movement and condition. These are just two examples taken from a special edition I co-edited on satellites and conservation in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B journal. Who is interested in satellite remote sensing? Basically anyone who seeks to understand large scale patterns in biodiversity distribution, or that has to deal with the management of big, remote, or inaccessible areas. An unparalleled view from above The level of information that can be derived from satellite data is pretty phenomenal, and too-often undervalued by ecologists and conservationists. For example, emperor penguin colonies can be found and the colony size estimated using very high resolution images. Changes to the extent or density of ecosystems can be tracked, and active sensors such as radar and lidar can report the 3D structure and density of vegetation. Just how “green” our world is can be extensively mapped on a fortnightly basis. So satellites help monitor both wildlife and vegetation in the natural world, able to provide information about the most remote and inaccessible places on Earth. They also capture information that helps us understand why, and predict where, biodiversity is declining. For example, measurements taken on the ground can be integrated with satellite data to track the current distributions of certain invasive species, and to predict their projected advance. High resolution images can be used to map problems associated with oil exploration and exploitation. The response of animals to shifts in temperatures or availability in food and resources can be analysed and predicted from satellite-based information. And deforestation, land degradation and the fragmentation of ecosystems as well as the expansion of urban areas have all been successfully monitored using satellites' unique viewpoint. Satellites' benefits extend beyond land to the oceans too, as there are some great examples of how satellites can support marine conservation. Spotting and monitoring oil spills is a classic example, using radar or infrared sensors. And using satellite data together with that from vessels' monitoring systems make it easier to detect illegal, undeclared or unreported fishing. Key new technologies need to be used Remote sensing is becoming central to our ability to understand and manage the natural world. From camera traps and microphone arrays, to guided <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> and Doppler radar, ecologists, conservationists and environmental or wildlife managers have been drawn towards new technological developments that provide the possibility of non-invasive monitoring. Satellite sensors are part of this incredibly powerful toolkit, and their scope to inform research and support resource management is continuously growing. For example, satellite data is now used to inform protected area management or species reintroduction programs. Perhaps obviously, the best uses for this technology and major breakthroughs are most likely to occur when remote sensing and conservation experts collaborate; yet this happens all too rarely. Conservationists and wildlife managers need better links to technical expertise and access to equipment, and working together would be greatly enhanced by common information-sharing platforms and the development of a more coordinated research agenda. Google Earth is one thing, but making government-funded satellite data and the software tools to use it freely accessible would be a key step to increase the number of new purposes the research community can put it to.

                                Guest author Matthew Brian Beck is a journalist and advertising strategist based in New York City. The next big thing is getting smaller and smaller. Historically, our social media experience has been chained to the first-screen browser and the one News Feed to rule them all. We've been saturated with bloated content from overpopulated streams. We've been bombarded with updates and notifications from friends and family we love, pages we Like, accounts we follow, colleagues we connect with, and acquaintances that can't even remember where we knew them from—we just couldn't keep up. We felt an impulsive urge to clean house, to make our feeds less cluttered and more manageable. But as our daily Internet consumption moves away from the desktop (and even the laptop), the landscape of social media is seeing a dramatic shift in native platforms and user behaviors. Smartphone hardware has matured. Wireless data networks have advanced. Mobile-first design has gone mainstream. But content oversaturation and deterioration of meaningful interactions is still a concern. That problematic intersection has birthed a new zeitgeist: Mobile tribes. We crave interpersonal interaction, the basic human need to connect and communicate with each other. The basal layer of social media has remained unchanged, but the chief characteristic of tribes is the tendency to categorize membership in distinct groups, movements, cultures and ideologies—to band together in subpopulations of shared interests, tastes, demographics and marketplaces. Yet, within tribes is the free will to exercise personal choice over who we connect and communicate with. That's where mobile comes in. The Age Of The Mega Platform Is Over In the post-PC era, we're increasingly finding content and connections exclusively on our phones. The first generation of social media touted "networking", but the next generation, raised in always-on connectivity, will embrace ephemerality and digital tribalism. Those users will abandon the major social networks and migrate to more granular mobile villages with simpler ecosystems. They will follow a small circle of close friends on Instagram, pin with a small handful of followers on Pinterest, message with a girlfriend or schoolmate on WhatsApp or Snapchat, or follow a co-worker's check-ins on Foursquare. Or, they will build the next platforms and apps that don't exist yet. Every platform will be socialized, but every user base will be judged on quality of life, not sheer numbers. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big data">Big data</a></span> will not matter as much as small relationships. Media and content will become less fragmented and centralized, more native and branded to the single-channel niche apps they appear in and the mobile tribes they appeal to. Even Facebook, the big-box chain of social networking, realizes its problem of content oversaturation and the trend towards granularity and mobile tribes. The company has doubled down on developing its mobile suite (where most of the company’s active power users live, and where the ad dollars are most brisk) and "unbundling the big blue app," according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. "I think on mobile, people want different things," Zuckerberg told The New York Times. "Ease of access is so important. So is having the ability to control which things you can get notifications for. And the real estate is so small. In mobile, there's a big premium on creating single-purpose first-class experiences." Brands, companies and startups that build social products, services and devices must build for app-only tribes in the future. They must think like the end user, one that has always grown up with a smartphone and a few favorite apps. These new platforms will be connected for (and by) app-only mobile natives—carefully curated and tightly managed for the community, but also streamlined for productivity and responsiveness. They must know and respect the user, and his or her mobile tribe. Because on the Internet, there's just too much stuff to see, people to meet, food to Instagram, and not nearly enough time for it all.

                                I’m a music junkie. Like many of you, my life is often accompanied by a soundtrack. I’ve got playlists for working out, and just plain working. Music for when I’m feeling on top of the world, and music for when I'm down in the gutter. Songs that make me think, and songs that bring back memories. Music is important to me—and probably to you as well. But despite the importance of music, technology is really what allows it to be such a huge part of our lives. So how is tech going to shape the future for music fans like me and you? I needed to find out. I connected with the band Switchfoot—known for the songs "Meant To Live" and "Dare You To Move"—to see if and how they are embracing technology to make their music more enjoyable to fans. What I found is that they're using tech to give their fans more: More access, more content and more control. This isn’t a story about artists making more money. It’s a glimpse into what the future has in store for people who love music. People like you and me. Why Switchfoot? There’s no scientific reason for the choice. I wanted to pick an artist, so I picked one I was a fan of. As it turned out, the way these guys use technology to connect with their followers probably represents a decent cross-section of how artists in general are using tech to engage with fans. Switchfoot has a wide range of experiences that makes it a worthy envoy: The band has been independent, it's been signed to a major label and it's won a Grammy. Within minutes of our first conversation, I could tell this band was using technology in innovative ways—especially to create closer connections with fans. According to Switchfoot’s bass player Tim Foreman (who majored in computer science and handled the band’s early Web development) the band’s music—and it’s use of technology—is all about connectivity. “We’re part of this greater creative community that includes our fans," Foreman said. "We want to make them co-conspirators with us. They’re just as much a part of this as we are. For us as a band, it’s all about the conversation, and to that end we’re always looking to eliminate barriers between us and the people that listen to our music.” Building Bridges RebelMouse is a tool Switchfoot uses to simultaneously break down barriers and fuel the conversation. Implemented on one of the band’s websites, FadingWest.tv, RebelMouse pulls together tweets, Instagram photos and videos into a single unified hub. As social as social media is, not every fan has an account on every platform. With RebelMouse, fans on one network but not another—Twitter, but not Instagram, or vise-versa—suddenly have access to a treasure trove of content. As empowering as the band’s social media strategy is, Switchfoot has gone even further to include fans in its journey—literally. Switchfoot has used services like WeDemand! to give fans a chance to help shape the touring schedule. WeDemand! works by allowing fans to raise social support for bringing their favorite artists to areas that may normally be overlooked. Aside from demanding a show, fans can also leave comments for the band on the site. A glance at the band’s WeDemand! page shows a large group of commenters requesting a show in Omaha. See also: Can Technology Predict The Grammys? Band-to-fan communication is commonplace in the music industry, but fan-to-band communication is finally becoming more common. Switchfoot has also tried to encourage and enable fan-to-fan communication as well: When group messaging service GroupMe was brand new, the band encouraged fans that purchased tickets to download the app in order to communicate with each other while attending concerts and festivals. A messaging app may not sound like the type of tech a band would be on the lookout for—and in truth, it isn’t always a natural fit—but Switchfoot is always looking for benefits that aren’t necessarily obvious. “One of the interesting things I’ve discovered is that many times the primary use of technologies or services is not actually the primary benefit for us," Foreman said. "For instance, we’ve used LivingSocial to promote some of our album and tour stuff. Most people are just focused on the sales numbers, but for us, that’s not really the main equation there. What’s often overlooked is the fact that they have this huge mailing list. So whether you sell 100 or 10,000 tickets, you’re reaching millions of eyeballs. I think a lot of technology and services out there have a second layer that is beneficial but often overlooked.” Some services do offer obvious benefits, and the band has those covered, too. Will Call is an app that offers fans a better concert experience by helping them coordinate with other friends at the show, buy merch from their phones without having to face frenzied crowds, and even discover more concerts to attend. Switchfoot has been an early adopter of the Will Call service, which is currently only available in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. An Organized Strategy Switchfoot doesn’t just stumble across new technology and decide to use it willy-nilly. Bruce Flohr, the band’s manager and an executive at Red Light Management, is dedicated to finding new tech that fits with the band’s desires to connect with fans. So what’s his strategy? Flohr says he’s not just looking for the next Snapchat or Twitter. “We’re trying to find things that make sense for our fans," he said. "We look at things that fit into our fan’s lifestyle and try to work with technologies in that space.” Flohr said it all comes down to one simple test: “The first question I ask is, ‘Would I use this?’ Because if it’s too complicated, then it’s very hard to get the early adopters on board.” One piece of technology that passed Bruce’s test was Square, the payment platform led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. At Switchfoot’s latest BroAm charity surf event in San Diego, volunteers were sent out with Square-equipped iPads to collect donations from the crowd of 11,000 people. Though Square made it easy to collect donations for the band, the iPad has become instrumental for Switchfoot in other ways, including the way the band records. “The iPad has become this incredible multi-instrument that let’s you do things that aren’t possible any other way,” Foreman said. “It’s exciting. Just the tactile nature of the iPad allows you to play certain instruments that don’t exist. You can sample things and manipulate them in ways you couldn’t otherwise and we did a lot of that on the new record.” Foreman said many musicians tend to favor old gear like amps and guitars, but the bassist insisted Switchfoot enjoys exploring new tech. “I think it’s exciting to kind of let go of that for a second and be freed of those constraints and look at everything as an instrument and a possibility,” Foreman said. The Internet Isn't Always Friendly There have been times when technology has gotten in the way of the band’s connectivity to its fans. About 10 years ago when the band was signed with Columbia Records, the label was experimenting with copy protection. One of the band’s albums—Nothing Is Sound, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart—was included in the experiment… without the guys' prior knowledge. Foreman explains: See also: 10 Music Services You May Not Know About—But Should “We got our copy of the album a couple of days before it was released to the public and saw this big disclaimer on the back and found out that it had this protection that didn’t allow you to put it on your iPod (which at the time was already a huge deal). And we were just so offended that they would put out this message that basically tells our fans that we don’t trust them. We felt it was the most disingenuous thing that could possibly be put on our album.” At that point, Foreman's background in computer science kicked in and he posted a hack on the band’s message boards to let fans circumvent the copy protection to “use the music they purchased and owned how they wanted.” According to Wikipedia, the workaround was quickly deleted by Sony. Giving Fans What They Want By now you’ve probably picked up on an emerging theme. We’ve already seen how the band has used services like RebelMouse to surface and amplify fan-generated content, but technology is also allowing the band to produce more content themselves. In the future, harnessing, organizing and interpreting community information will help the band determine what kind of content to produce. See also: How To Stream Music With Google Chromecast “Data can help the band give the consumer what they want," Flohr said. "More and more we’re finding they might not want an entire album’s worth of material once every two years. They may want more material sooner and better experiences on the live side.” Did you glaze over that last statement or did it sink all the way in? Because it’s important. You, me, us, as music fans—we may be literally shaping what our favorite artists will produce in the future. We, the consumers, are really the ones being empowered, thanks to all of this technology. The future of being a music fan is sounding pretty good right now, but it’s also looking better visually thanks to the welcome onslaught of quality video content heading our way. It’s only natural: As the makers of our devices and the networks that connect them build their pipes to be larger and more connected, there will only be more demand for water ("content"). Water, Water, Everywhere There are plenty of ways fans can get extra content these days, especially with all the "behind-the-scenes" goodies out there. Flohr told me how music fans can use services like SoundHound to ID songs and unlock second-screen experiences with exclusive video content from the band. There's GoPro footage taken on-stage, brief five-minute video podcasts with tour updates, and even webcam setups in recording studios—Switchfoot has kept busy producing this video content, and last year, it even made a feature-length film to accompany the band's latest album. The two projects share the same name: Fading West. The Fading West movie is a chance for fans to further immerse in the band’s story. “The smart artists realize that they are storytellers and Switchfoot is a perfect example of that,” Flohr said. “Fading West is not a music documentary, it’s not a concert film. It’s a story of the band’s passion of both music and surfing and how they’ve been able to incorporate both into their lives and how both have influenced their career.” The film adds new depth to the group’s music and history, but after I watched it, I also felt like I’d gotten to know new friends. The film made me laugh, it made me sad, and it showed me things I didn’t expect to see. In short, it was great content. Content that my device—and inner fan—both craved. Content I’d like more of. (Fortunately for me, the YouTube lifestyle network focused on extreme sports called "Network A" partnered with Switchfoot to release some exclusive behind-the-scenes footage.) Switchfoot's movie—and the pipes that allow it to be delivered to new and existing fans around the world—have gone a long way toward helping the band’s fans feel more connected to the group. “I feel like the sense of community at our shows has never been greater because of the film,” Foreman said. “I feel like we were really vulnerable and honest in it and showed a different side of ourselves that people hadn’t seen. And I think letting people in on that just kind of furthers that sense of community. It adds to the intrigue and brings people along with us.” The Great Frontier I was a bit surprised to discover Switchfoot isn’t just using technology; the band is helping drive its development, too. While the band hasn’t built any tech tools from scratch yet and probably won’t fund any new products angel investor-style, Flohr said he “could see the band developing new technology in partnership with a tech company where they help as early adopters and by doing R&D... And it would not surprise me if what they helped develop was not necessarily IP but maybe hardware.” There’s a good chance your favorite artists will use some of these same tools and community-building techniques to engage fans as well, if they aren’t already. “It’s like anything,” Flohr said. “Good ideas get repeated over and over again. Even though you might be first to market with technology, if it works you open the floodgates.” So what kind of technology is the band looking into adopting next? “We’re looking into [<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>]," Foreman said. "I like the idea of straight peer-to-peer interaction. I think that’s something we’ve tried to do whether it’s online or offline—you know, like hanging out with kids after the show. It’s kind of the same concept of trying to eliminate barriers.” Music will always be about bringing people together, but it's clear that technology’s role will only help to amplify these community conversations to drive more—and better—content. And that's something anyone can nod their head to. Images courtesy of Shutterstock; Switchfoot images by Chris Burkhard

Thanks to artist Thomas Van Houtryve, who mounted his DSLR camera on a quadcopter and flew it over weddings, soccer games, public prayer groups and funerals, now you'll know. What would it look if those missiles and cameras were pointed at your house, your car, your family and friends?

Like Google’s new <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, which can reach impressive heights, tech shares soared in the early part of this year. Then in March a sell-off began that battered the stocks of many Silicon Valley stars. The tech-heavy NASDAQ stockmarket index steadied somewhat early this week, and shares in older tech firms like HP and IBM, which are traded on the main market, have done well. But investors and companies are still jittery.Those worried that a new internet bubble pumped up by wild dreams and unabashed greed is now deflating will be watching closely to see whether tech firms’ latest results give further cause for alarm. On April 15th Yahoo published its quarterly earnings, which showed a tiny increase in revenue after excluding the cost of fees paid to its partner websites. Its shares rose on the news. Google was due to report its results the next day, after The Economist went to press.It is not just web firms whose performance is under the microscope. Shares in biotech companies, which adapt and exploit processes found in living organisms to create drugs and other useful products, have also taken a beating. Having risen by 60% last year, the NASDAQ biotech...

But the models may hide rather than reveal the deepest sources of social ills. In 1969, Playboy published a long, freewheeling interview with Marshall McLuhan in which the media theorist and sixties icon sketched a portrait of the future that was at once seductive and repellent. Noting the ability of digital computers to analyze data and communicate messages, he predicted that the machines eventually would be deployed to fine-tune society’s workings. “The computer can be used to direct a network of global thermostats to pattern life in ways that will optimize human awareness,” he said. “Already, it’s technologically feasible to employ the computer to program societies in beneficial ways.” He acknowledged that such centralized control raised the specter of “brainwashing, or far worse,” but he stressed that “the programming of societies could actually be conducted quite constructively and humanistically.”

                                NOT so long ago, China looked to be the promised land for crypto-currencies. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> and its rivals were traded freely and online exchanges proliferated. On one estimate, China accounted for more than half of the world’s trade in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> last year. Near the end of last year, when its price was above $1,000, more than 100,000 coins were being traded daily on BTC China, a local exchange.Alas, those heady days are gone. Prices have plunged below $500 of late and hardly 2,000 coins are now traded daily on BTC China. According to Bobby Lee, the exchange’s founder, “Most investors have left the market.” What happened? The short answer is regulation.In early December China’s central bank declared that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was not a currency. This slowed its rise, but enthusiasts remained unbowed as the declaration fell far short of the outright ban some had feared. Then regulators forbade the firms that act as middlemen between businesses and credit-card networks from working with the exchanges. That was a more serious blow, but exchange operators found ways round the ban (for example, by using related companies to deal with the payment processors).Rumours now suggest that the...

                                In countries that have based their wealth on production, every discovery and innovation that potentially lower production costs attract very strong attention. Since 2007, the discovery and exploitation of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> and oil have put the USA energy industry back on the track to competitive procurement faced with competing nations who have been low costs champions for decades. The new question on the table is to ascertain whether 3D printing can have a comparable impact. [This is a content summary only.

The company in question is Titan Aerospace, which manufactures what it calls "atmospheric satellites." Unlike traditional satellites, they operate around 20 kilometers (12 miles) above Earth, which is just short of the point of being in orbit. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> such as the Solara 50 look and operate similar to an airplane, but have solar panels on its wings, ...

The collapse means customers have almost certainly lost nearly half a billion US dollars in "real money." Mt Gox is a Tokyo-based business founded in 2009 as a trading card exchange (Source: wikipedia.org ). It has recently filed for bankruptcy protection because it has debt worth $63.6 million, but assets worth only just half over that.
