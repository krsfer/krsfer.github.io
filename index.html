                                China Carnival No 1: Tiananmen (2007), by Chen Zhou and Huang Keyi White Rabbit Gallery, Sydney The following remarks were presented at a recent public forum in Sydney to celebrate the launch of Kerry Brown’s Carnival China: The People’s Republic in the era of Hu Jintao; Essays on Politics, Society and Culture. They tackle the issue of how best to understand the confused and confusing political dynamics of contemporary China. The booming business of China watching and China assessment has produced an assortment of glib orthodoxies, none more potent than the conclusion that the political system of China is ‘authoritarian’. The grip of phrases such as ‘authoritarianism’, ‘authoritarian rule’ and ‘authoritarian capitalism’ arguably stems from their imprecision, hence from their malleability in the hands of a wide range of scholars, journalists, politicians and pundits, all of whom like to portray China as an ‘authoritarian regime’, often to suit their own scholarly and political standpoints. Consider some well-known examples. The American businessman James McGregor speaks of China as a ‘one-of-a-kind system of authoritarian capitalism that is in danger of terminating itself – and taking the world down with it.’ The Chinese political experiment, he says, resembles a hybrid combination of the so-called Gilded Age and the Robber Baron eras. Surprisingly similar language is used, for quite different purposes, by the darling of the hard Left, the Bolshevik clown Slavoj <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Žižek">Žižek</a></span>, who insists that the virus of ‘authoritarian capitalism is slowly but surely spreading around the globe, nowhere more so than China’. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Žižek">Žižek</a></span> questions the claim that ‘political democracy’ is ‘the “natural” political accompaniment of capitalism’ by posing a provocative question: ‘What if China’s authoritarian capitalism is not a stop on the road to further democratization, but the end state toward which the rest of the world is headed?’ With less flourish, more than a few Atlantic-region political scientists sing the same refrain. They describe China either as a straightforward case of an ‘authoritarian regime’, or as a strange new form of ‘fragmented authoritarianism’, a polity whose rulers ‘show signs of responsiveness’ to the ‘increasingly diverse demands of Chinese society’, but nonetheless a political system that remains ‘authoritarian’ to its one-party state foundations. What these contrasting interpretations of China have in common is their deep attachment both to the nebulous notion of authoritarianism and the belief that an ‘authoritarian regime’ is the opposite of ‘democracy’. Some observers tap this presumption for the purpose of welcoming the historic trend towards ‘post-democracy’. Others mobilise the same conviction to warn of the ‘rise of China’, or of the ‘China menace’. Great power theorists are especially concerned with the way rising powers provoke war with established hegemons, such as the United States. They say that the ascent of ‘authoritarian’ China is the defining story of our age; or that its system of ‘market authoritarianism’ confronts the global order with the great new challenge of rekindling ‘the drive among others to acquire and preserve democratic freedoms’. The claim that ‘authoritarian’ China is fundamentally at odds with American-style ‘democracy’ has a notable pedigree (traceable to a classic essay on the subject by Samuel Huntington), but it’s an unpersuasive platitude. Or so contends the distinguished China specialist and public intellectual Kerry Brown, whose wonderful study of contemporary China is no ordinary book. It is remarkable, in several ways. Most obviously, it is a ground-breaking interpretation of Chinese politics that openly admits its own biases, along the way strongly encouraging readers to nurture their own sense of wonder about the myriad dramatic and contradictory things that are going on in contemporary China. Brown shows that a common mistake among China analysts is their misplaced narcissism, their misjudged efforts to ‘find bones in an egg’ (jī dàn li tiāo gŭ tou), as the Chinese expression has it, as if China is best judged by their own political standards of American-style ‘liberal democracy’. In matters of China scholarship, he cautions against closed minds, along the way inviting readers to admit uncertainties, to explore their own ignorance, above all to see that contemporary China is no simple or straightforward actuality, but instead a cauldron of contradictions, a kaleidoscope of confusing and conflicting trends. China is a ‘reality’ which ought to make observers feel, in matters of observation, the truth of the common Chinese saying (xiā zi mō xiàng) that in these times all of us rather resemble the blind person sizing up different parts of an elephant that cannot be summarised in simple terms. Fascinating and pleasurable to read in equal measure, this is a book that was never intended to be a book. Treated as a genre of writing, it’s a fine set of field notes, let’s call them, a political anthropology of contemporary China that represents much more than an alluring chest of treasured observations of the bamboozling ins and outs of social and political trends in contemporary China. Brown shows that China is a state of mind, a way of using words. For him, words really count when analysing Chinese society and politics, just as they do elsewhere. He probes the prevailing language through which Chinese politics is analysed, and shows it to be wanting, badly. Not only does he cast doubt on the prejudice of those commentators and critics who suppose that ‘authoritarian’ China is a standard post-communist polity tottering through a transition towards American-style ‘liberal democracy’, itself the normative standard by which Chinese politics should be adjudged. Brown pushes much further. He shows that China cannot be described, loosely, lazily, unthinkingly, using the term ‘authoritarianism’, to mean a type of regime in which established power supposes it has ‘authority’, an absolute right to assert itself against its actual or potential opponents. Brown’s objection is not that this way of describing things destroys the precious meaning and rich political significance of the root word ‘authority’ (which it does). He instead demonstrates that when used as a synonym for haughty power whose agents suppose their own unquestionable superiority, the term ‘authoritarianism’ wildly underestimates the carnivalesque lives of both the rulers and struggling citizens of China. Chinese realities are bewildering. Contradictions are found in all leading institutions, at every street corner, in every nook and cranny of its vibrant multi-media scene. China is almost a fictional place, a country where tragedy and comedy come together on the same stage. China is a land where desperately poor and unhappy petitioners risk everything, even disappearance into terrifying black jails, for the sake of their dignity. It is a country where the strong prey on the weak; where a burgeoning middle class opposed to free multi-party elections is willing to stand up and be counted for more accountable and open government; a place where money-making is called socialism, where there are more billionaires, skyscrapers and card-carrying communists than in the rest of the world. On Brown’s reckoning, China is most definitely not a ‘people’s democracy’, as its officials at all levels like to claim. It is certainly describable as a one-party-dominated political system marked by such well-recorded dysfunctions as vast undisclosed business fiefdoms, violence, censorship, corruption and hypocrisy. Parts of the system function in the totalitarian ways of old, using new methods, in the brutal repression of the Turkic-speaking citizens of Xinjiang, for instance. There are thuggish police tactics; excessive taxes designed to force land grabs; official brutality in crushing rebellions in the countryside. In the cities, there are the dreaded household registrations, enterprise layoffs, the confiscation of retirement pensions, arrests of those who want publicly to remind others that urban skies were once blue, or remember the Party’s past crimes. China is also a land which sings the praises of the winner of a Nobel Prize for Literature (Mo Yan) and cracks down hard on thousands of free-minded and honest writers; a country that silences rights lawyers and passes an Open Governance Law (in 2008). It is a polity run by governing officials who pride themselves by day on their commitments to the principles of open government, promotion by merit and ‘smart power’ geared to serving ‘the people’, all the while fostering forms of government by moonlight lubricated by binge drinking, delirious sex, conspicuous consumption and rivers of cash. It is said that money makes the Chinese world go round, yet Brown points out that this is a labyrinthine political system, if system it can be called, in which political patronage and politics broadly defined is very much in command. Party officials know that money grows on the trees of political power. They know equally well the need to parade their political power. They dress and eat differently; as Brown notes, even their body smell is distinctive. They are naturally mindful of their vulnerability, which is why (for instance) vast sums of money are spent on domestic policing and surveillance, much more than on outside military forces. It’s also why, in order to rebuild damaged Party authority, since 1988, across more than 600,000 villages, there have been over a million elections, with some three million Party officials chosen by voters. Brown reminds his readers that Party officials, like snakes after a long winter, have shed their belief in ‘socialism’; and we learn that a permanent tug-of-war between the authorities and those they try to rule is now a chronic feature of a political system that is sometimes so ramshackle, and so experimental, that it cannot accurately be described using any standard category drawn from political theory, or political science. All things considered, what can be learned from reading this thoughtful, imaginative, illuminating book? Brown’s fine study teaches us that China is not what it seems. He’s sure that speaking of China as an ‘authoritarian regime’ is nonsense, simply because it ignores the ‘immensely complex and disunited’ qualities of a quasi-imperial state that is both riddled with dysfunctions and yet ‘sort of unified, sort of in control of the main levers of the economy’, and of the wider society. Brown’s observations are especially astute on the subject of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Unlike the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which collapsed like a house of cards in the winds of popular revolution during the period 1989-1991, the CCP has actively recruited members, many of them prominent and powerful figures in the fields of government, business, university and artistic life. The Party seeks to rule through wealth creation and ‘the appearance of consent’. Its leadership treads carefully. It is acutely aware of the dangers of hubris and the need for government based on merit, performance and popular consent. Party leaders know well the Chinese proverb that powerful people fear fame just as pigs fear getting fat. They are well aware (says Brown) that the country grows ‘wealthier but scrappier, less harmonious and less content by the day’. So he points out that China’s dominant political class suffers from chronic anxiety. Its leadership, and plenty of its members, who make up only 7% of the whole population, often seem neurotic, or perhaps proto-democratic, in their constant self-examination, self-justification and relentless attention-seeking. There are times (purchasing overseas property, for instance) when Party members act as if their time is fast running out. It comes as no surprise that they fear violent unrest, or that they are aware of the fine line that separates cowardice from civic courage. Hence their path-breaking laboratory experiments: their political interest in practices of open and publicly accountable government, such as live-streamed public forums, their calculated toleration of on-line public controversies and their hands-off attitudes to independently-minded ‘public opinion leaders’ (yú lùn ling xiù), figures such as the bad boy blogger Han Han, the young model Gan Lulu and Yao Chen, the award-winning actress with a bold tongue and a huge sina weibo following. Brown does not probe these latter trends in much detail, or ask whether there is any truth in the claim that China is ‘the advocate and builder of democracy’ with local characteristics, or whether perhaps the Chinese polity, slowly but surely, is becoming a strange simulacrum of the type of locally-defined democratic vision sketched in such documents as the Charter ’08 manifesto. Critics may say as well that Brown’s account of the unfinished carnival of Chinese society and politics suffers from its excessive concentration on the ‘domestic’; that what’s lost is the overriding fact that China, the fabled ‘workshop of the world’, is now vigorously extending its planetary reach, from ‘soft power’ diplomacy and mineral holdings in Africa, to currency markets in the West, to oilfields in the Middle East, to agribusiness in Latin America and Australia, to the factories of East Asia. The objection would be unfair, and not just because he has written about the subject elsewhere, or that in these pages Brown argues forcefully against unthinking alarmism. His smart and discerning study of the carnival called China spotlights the many ways China’s global ambitions are held back by confusions and contradictions at home. Brown shows why China’s rich and powerful rulers are finding it hard to win the world’s love, why China’s global presence is more broad than deep, and why, in other words, China is a ‘partial power’ (David Shambaugh) that still lacks the domestic preconditions befitting a major world power. More than anything else, Brown wisely teaches us to hold our breath. He knows that China will not escape the cast-iron rule that futures are never predictable. Using finely crafted words, he shows that the shape of things to come is always subject to the quantum principle of uncertainty, to the many not-yet-known causes and causers that shape people’s lives, and their environments. This quantum principle trumps money, power and influence, and that’s why Brown is right to say that when it comes to the future of China everybody - its rich and greedy tai zi dang, its Party officials at all levels, its 1.3 billion citizens and the whole world - are in for some rude surprises.

                                Zeta Interactive CEO David A. Steinberg has lived through remarkable success and failure alike as a serial entrepreneur and executive. In his 20-year career, he's learned hard lessons that have made him wiser, more effective, and especially more prudent, he tells Business Insider. Steinberg jumped into the growing cellular phone industry a year out of college, founding the retail chain and business-to-business provider Sterling Cellular in 1992. He then founded the telemarketing company Sterling Communications, which he sold in 1999 along with his retail business, starting online cellular commerce and business-to-business company InPhonic that same year. At its height, Steinberg says, InPhonic was bringing in approximately $400 million in revenue. In 2004, it was named the fastest-growing private company in the U.S. by Inc. magazine and went public that same year. By 2007, however, it was in bankruptcy due to mismanagement and a host of other factors. He quickly moved forward, founding the digital marketing firm that was rebranded this year as Zeta Interactive with his business partner John Sculley, former PepsiCo president and Apple CEO. Steinberg tells us that Zeta brought in revenue of $90 million last year and that it's already passed $100 million this year. He projects year-over-year growth of 90% and says its operating margin is in the mid-teens and rising, meaning that Zeta is on a healthy, fast-growth path. Here are some powerful growth lessons Steinberg says he's learned from being at the top to being at the bottom, and how they are helping him today: Set up people and processes for sustainable growth. One of the reasons InPhonic ultimately failed is because it grew too quickly, Steinberg says. It went from offering 100,000 phone rebates to customers to offering one million in the span of a year — and the company simply wasn't ready to handle it, both in terms of manpower and technology. Customer service began to suffer significantly due to the inability to adapt, and Steinberg tells us that rebate turnaround times increased from one month to six months. Looking back, Steinberg says he should have eased the company into a more manageable direction, in addition to replacing certain employees that were not good fits for a new direction. "The people who got you to where you are won't always get you where you need to go," he says. At his current company Zeta, Steinberg says he has chief information officer Jeffry Nimeroff focus on making sure that the company's technology is always able to handle Zeta's growth. By using a data-based growth strategy, Steinberg is able to avoid unnecessarily risky initiatives that the company may not be able to adapt to. Hand off responsibilities. "It took me 20 years to realize I'm not the best at everything," Steinberg says, laughing. For example, he says that 15 years ago he wouldn't have been able to effectively manage his current chief operating officer, Steve Gerber, because he wouldn't have been able to hand off day-to-day management decisions to him. Steinberg says that he's learned that to increase your chances of developing leaders within your own company, it's necessary to hire very intelligent people for your team. "You can teach smart people to do almost anything," he says. Pivot every six to nine months. Steinberg thinks that a high-growth company needs to constantly reinvent itself to stay relevant, and that doesn't necessarily mean that it needs to go in a radical new direction. Zeta started in the education sector before pivoting over to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> marketing solutions, and it's worked out well. He says that as head of InPhonic he should have acquired an outside wireless company to keep InPhonic interesting and able to handle accelerated growth. Never put yourself in a situation you can't get out of. On that note, Steinberg says he made the mistake of setting self-imposed limitations on what InPhonic could be. Part of this had to do with his former obsession with getting press for InPhonic when it was still young, which resulted in excessive coverage of certain initiatives he should have dropped when they stopped working. This time around with Zeta, he focused on finding what worked before reaching out to the media. He says that today it's "the biggest tech company in New York that no one's heard of." It's better to figure out a growth strategy under the radar than limiting your ability to change course, he says. Don't be afraid to let the market come to you. "Most startups wait to start in a time that's hot for their industry," Steinberg says, but that's not necessarily the best option. If you sit on an idea and wait for the market to open its arms to it, then you risk reaching an opportunity for scaled growth at a time when that particular market cools. If you happen to have a great idea, Steinberg recommends building a company regardless of what the market is doing. And if that great idea turns out to be a great company, then you can still find an audience. Similarly, Steinberg says, he's never started a company with an exit strategy, as some serial entrepreneurs do. "The exit will find you," he says. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: RICHARD BRANSON: Success From Hard Work Is Not 'Luck' DON'T MISS: 7 Timeless Lessons From Bill Gates' Favorite Business Book Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                The irony of September being US National Preparedness month was not lost as Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) made an uncharacteristic global call for rapid deployment of civil and military medical assets with expertise in biohazard containment to west Africa. With 42% of all reported <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> infections occurring in the past month, and more than 2000 reported deaths, local health systems and international organisations were not prepared for the scale and speed of the current outbreak. MSF called for countries such as the UK and USA to deploy disaster response teams with medical and logistical experts for water and sanitation, building of mobile laboratories, isolation centres, hospitals, crematoriums, and the establishment of dedicated air bridges to move personnel and equipment between countries.

                                The United Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000, when the world agreed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), set in motion undoubtedly the most concerted effort for poverty alleviation and improvement in global health. The declaration prompted substantial increases in financing for global health, both from traditional donors and innovative financing sources, scaling up preventive and life-saving interventions.

Since there is no drug or vaccine of proven efficacy, most of the efforts in controlling the disease are directed towards prevention and containment. However, these efforts are frustrated by false rumours, ignorance, and potentially harmful cultural practices. Addressing these frustrations calls for wisdom, pragmatism, and political will.

The worst <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak on record has killed more than 2,400 people in West Africa - more than half of them in Liberia. Ambassador to Liberia Deborah Malac told reporters in Monrovia that the United States would support Liberia both through the epidemic and beyond.

A handful of critics have lampooned the Ice Bucket Challenge for its ubiquity, noting how many participants failed to mention its original philanthropic intentions. That is, of course, silly. The challenge raised money and awareness for ALS unlike any movement before it.

                                Adrift?EPA/Joshua Roberts US president Barack Obama has at last outlined his strategy for responding to the challenge of Islamic State (IS). In an address from the Oval Office, just a few hours short of the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, the president framed his strategy in terms of a general global counter-terrorism strategy – veering close, at times, to the sweeping generalisations of the infamous Global War on Terrorism. Hours later, it was announced that ten Arab states, among them Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, would join in the effort to stopping IS with various measures – including by, “as appropriate, joining in the many aspects of a coordinated military campaign”. As Obama put it, the United States will work with this “coalition of the willing” to “degrade and destroy” IS. But aside from referencing ongoing air strikes and the insertion of 455 more American troops on the ground to provide training and intelligence, his outline for what will actually happen next was somewhat short on detail, and long on atmospherics. Given his political situation, that much is perhaps not surprising. Back on track? Obama has long been under attack from the political left and right for his administration’s apparent strategic drift – criticism which he himself has played into of late. That drift is all the more worrisome given the range of “crises” facing the nation and the world — from a revanchist Russia to a rapidly modernising China, from transnational problems from climate change to an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak, from insurgencies in Africa to what was long known as the “AfPak” region. Hence the tempest in a teapot when obvious 2016 presidential contender and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton carped at Obama’s graceless but cogent maxim “don’t do stupid shit”, which she derided as “not an organising principle” for a foreign policy vision. On the other side of the aisle, we’ve seen the painful spectacle of potential Republican presidential nominee Rand Paul abandoning his libertarian intellectual birthright to criticise the President for not being Hawkish enough – a brazen attempt to curry favour with the Republican base and brand himself as a serious national leader. It’s all too easy to end up neck-deep in the party-political swamp here, but to properly evaluate the US’s new approach, we have to resist that temptation. Instead, we need to think about how well the President’s approach fits into the broader requirements of some US grand strategy, if one can really be said to exist any more. Ramping up Obama has made it clear that aside from a few trainers and intelligence specialists, the US’s military contribution to the anti-IS coalition will be limited to air strikes. But there are very few if any historical examples of airpower making a decisive impact against irregular forces, rather than traditional ground targets. In asymmetric conflicts like that against IS, airpower generally only works in conjunction with a credible and capable ground force. The problem is that there are many, many questions hovering over the effectiveness of Iraq’s US-trained forces, which have so far proven largely ineffective against IS’s machinations. Meanwhile, even the less-radical elements of Syria’s anti-Assad forces. That said, airpower remains the US’s most towering military advantage; it’s also a much less resource-intensive contribution than heavy ground deployment, vital at a time when so many other strategic challenges are facing the US and its allies. In times as chaotic and unpredictable as these, prioritising the IS threat over other challenges is ultimately a question of judgement. If Obama has reached the conclusion that IS represents a mortal danger to US citizens, then immediate action including the use of military force is by definition required. Equally, if he believes IS has the potential to become still more capable, and could become an even more significant challenge in the Middle East and elsewhere, prudent action today might nip a major catastrophe in the bud. But this is where Obama has rather fudged the argument. Neither Islamic nor a state Consistent with the publicly available intelligence, he admitted that IS does not yet pose an immediate threat to the US – and by denying IS’s self-proclaimed ambition to be recognised as an Islamic state per se, he has rather weakened the argument that the US and its coalition partners urgently need to “degrade and destroy” it before it in fact becomes one. Essentially, the president has tried to push the case that his strategy reconciles the demands of crisis management and political expediency with long-term national security objectives. His argument is that IS should be treated like any other terrorist group – a threat he has until now consistently confronted via a steady stream of targeted <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> strikes, virtually anywhere across the globe he deemed them necessary. If he believes that fighting terrorists in distant foreign territory is a national security priority, relentless strikes that destroy their save havens can help reconcile short-term threats versus long-term goals. It also justifies his willingness to assume the serious risks such strike operations inevitably entail. By appealing to the apparently still-deep reservoir of post-9/11 support for counter-terrorism measures in general, the president has made the case for indefinite extension of the counter-terrorism approach to deal with the latest terrorist group – but likely the next one as well. Obama’s strategy will not put an end to the “silly season” shenanigans of the American electoral cycle, with the midterm elections in November and the 2016 presidential campaign posturing already well underway. But by framing the IS problem as one of fighting terrorists, perhaps he can win enough vocal support from the American people to in turn persuade Congress to back his campaign of “degrading and destroying” – a campaign which he clearly understands will be long and risky. How this will fit the US’s pressing strategic interests for the coming decades – the Asia rebalancing, serious troubles in Eurasia, and who knows what else – remains an open question.

                                Slower activity.Abaporu, CC BY Non-communicable diseases that you can’t catch from someone else such as stroke, high blood pressure and cancer, account for 36.1m deaths worldwide. Put it another way, this is about 63% of all deaths in the world. While the West is familiar with contributory factors including smoking tobacco, drinking too much alcohol and inactive lifestyles, the vast majority of the global burden (80%) falls in the developing world, and Africa in particular, where rapid urbanisation, population growth and ageing is driving up the number. Current projections suggest that without action this will rise to 52m by 2030. Deaths from these types of diseases in Africa are also now projected to exceed those from infectious and nutritional diseases, and maternal and perinatal conditions by 2030. But there is wide speculation that the burden may actually be higher than has been reported. Most published reports on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are based largely on the number of deaths and disabilities rather than actual annual number of people living with the disease. A major gap in Africa is the lack of data – and this has affected the conduct of research on the prevalence of NCDs. For the few estimates on Africa that we do have, there are doubts about sources and the appropriateness of the methods; for example which countries are included in which studies. The question is whether these estimates can closely be said to reflect the entire African population? Some experts believe these estimates are based more on extrapolation and over-modelling of the scarce data in the region – which means the answer would be no. A series of studies we conducted at the University of Edinburgh involved a systematic search of the literature on major NCDs in Africa on stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), high blood pressure (hypertension), asthma, and colon cancer. We found ample evidence of a relationship between age and the prevalence of chronic disease, with the middle to older age groups more affected. This is no surprise. In Africa, people are now more mindful of their health than they used to be, so they now tend to seek better health services. Consequently, average life expectancy has been increasing. But as people live longer (with unchecked exposures to smoking, alcohol, sedentary lifestyles, salt and cholesterol consumption) the number of people with NCDs in the region may possibly increase. We then developed an epidemiological model based on the age of the population and UN population estimates for Africa, which accounted for population growth and ageing earlier noted. Our estimates suggested a higher prevalence of NCDs in Africa and therefore that official figures are an underestimation. For example, in 2010, we estimated that there were about 130.2m cases of hypertension (25.9%) in Africa in people aged over 20 and 483,000 new stroke cases and 1.89m stroke survivors (around 317 per 100,000 of the population) in people aged over 15. There were also 26.3m cases of COPD (13.4%) in people over 40, 49.7m (13.9%) children under 15 with asthma, and more than 23,000 cases of colon cancer. These figures are significantly higher than have been previously reported. For example, WHO African region reported that there were 20m people living with hypertension in 2005, but this is far below the 92.3m cases we estimated for Africa for 2000. We still cannot say with all certainty that these are the exact estimates of these NCDs in Africa, because we simply don’t have enough data. Estimates at national and regional-level of prevalence and number of cases in Africa are few, partly because of poor health information and management systems across many countries. This has also been further affected by governments’ policies, priorities and funding that are weighted towards infectious diseases, notably <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria">malaria</a></span>, tuberculosis, and in recent times, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus disease. Obviously, the burden of infectious diseases may be decreasing, with the availability of vaccination and other control measures in Africa, but not without a relative rise in NCDs burden because of how funds are allocated and other factors. Instead, both infectious disease and NCDs now act as a “double burden” on the continent. To get better population estimates, we ultimately need better research. As NCDs are a clear problem in Africa, we would hope African nations would add this to their list of priorities in health. Without better figures, it will be hard to make better policies in response to the problem.

                                Lucas123 writes Tesla CEO <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> has said his company's Gigafactory battery plant, the world's largest, will be "self contained" and run on solar, wind and geothermal energy. The obvious problem with renewable sources is that they're intermittent at any given location, but on a larger scale they're quite predictable and reliable, according to Tom Lombardo, a professor of engineering and technology. Lombardo points out that Tesla isn't necessarily going off-grid, but using a strategy of "net metering" where the factory will produce more renewable energy than it needs, and receive credits in return from its utility when renewables aren't available. So why can't other manufacturing facilities do the same? Is what Tesla is doing not necessarily transferable to other industries? Sam Jaffe, principal research analyst with Navigant Research, believes Tesla's choice of locations — Reno — and its product is optimal for using renewable and not something that can be reproduced by every industry. <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                Judgement day. Phill Magakoe/Pool/EPA Oscar Pistorius has been cleared of premeditated murder charges, but found guilty of culpable homicide – a crime for which he could face a possible 15 years behind bars. He has also been found guilty of firing a gun in a restaurant. The possibility that presiding judge, Thokozile Masipa, may send the world-famous Paralympian to jail has roused many to ask about prison conditions in South Africa, and specifically how those with physical disabilities fare. The short answer is: not good and not well. The department of correctional services has policies in place for dealing with physically disabled inmates. Policy and practice, however, are often poles apart. Unfortunately, prisoners with disabilities face the same inhumane conditions as other able-bodied inmates. Human rights activists – including the Wits Justice Project – have protested the conditions in which South African prisoners are kept for many years, pointing to the many constitutional safeguards they violate. South African prisons are overcrowded (on average 128% and in some prisons over 200%), which result in serious problems with violence and communicable diseases. Tuberculosis is the number one killer in South African prisons, as a result of poor ventilation and overcrowding. According to a report by the Judicial Inspectorate of Correctional Services, 110 of the 800 natural deaths in prison in 2011 and 2012 were caused by TB. Pistorius case an anomaly Although the Pistorius case has highlighted many deficiencies in the criminal justice system, it is important to understand that it nonetheless received more resources and expert input that the great majority of ordinary cases. Or to put it another way: the Pistorius case is an anomaly. Other cases normally take much longer and both the victims and the accused face the strong probability of a miscarriage of justice. This is further exacerbated by the profound poverty in which many South Africans still live, which limits their ability to access justice. For instance, Pistorius spent no time in remand detention at all, whereas the average time spent in prison by an arrestee before being brought to trial is three months – due largely to the length of time that the police take to verify the address of the detainee, in order for bail to be granted, and to investigate the case. ‘We are 88 men in this cell’ The best way to highlight these differences is to compare his case to that of another inmate with a disability, paraplegic Ronnie Fakude. Caroyln Raphaely, senior journalist with the Wits Justice Project, began covering Ronnie’s story in early 2013, in a story published by the South African Saturday Star and The Guardian. In it, Ronnie is quoted verbatim, describing his conditions as follows: I’m a 50-year-old paraplegic and have been awaiting trial for more than two years since my arrest on fraud charges in December 2011. I can’t walk, I can’t control my bowel or bladder and have to wear disposable baby nappies which my family buy for me. I’m paralysed from level four and don’t have a wheelchair. If I use my [crutches] I have to pull my legs and throw them to the front. That’s how I walk. Living here is very hard. We are 88 men in this cell which is meant for 32. Sometimes there are more. Twelve people sleep in two bunks pushed together, that’s six on the top and six on the bottom. I have my own bed on the bottom, which is a privilege. Luckily, I don’t have to share because of my medical status. There are eight or 10 people with TB in this cell and four or five we know are <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-positive. A guy with multi-drug resistant TB sleeps on top of me. I feel vulnerable all the time. In the latest of the many follow-ups she published, Raphaely closely compares the Fakude and Pistorius cases, as well as that of Shrien Dewani, the murder suspect extradited to South African from the UK, concluding as follows: The harsh truth is that those with money and privilege fare far better on the justice continuum than the poor or indigent from the moment of arrest, and this often starts with bail. Like Pistorius and Dewani, Fakude remains theoretically innocent until proven guilty. Unlike Pistorius, who was granted R1m [£56,000] bail and a subsequent relaxation of his bail conditions permitting him to travel and drink alcohol, Fakude never applied for bail because he believed he couldn’t afford it – his co-accused were granted bail of R15,000, a sum that was beyond his means. Electronic tags Fakude has been released from remand, and has instead been “electronically tagged” to ensure his return to the court for his upcoming trial. It would be a further irony if the Pistorius team used the Fakude ruling as a precedent to argue for their client to take part in the electronic tagging programme, which has only recently been rolled out in South Africa. Given what we know of the prison conditions in South Africa, it seems only fair that prisoners with physical disabilities should automatically be considered to be electronically tagged, allowing them to keep some dignity intact.

                                When African nations can effectively curb tax evasion, they may also be able to fight their major health problems.AAP/EPA/AHMED JALLANZO Much has been written about the poor public health and clinical capacity to respond to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in West Africa. Inadequate medical and nursing staff resources, inadequate isolation wards, inadequate intensive care resources, insufficient ambulances. An international emergency response is being mounted in an attempt to fill this huge resource gap. Doctors and other health professionals “without borders” are playing a crucial response role, but this is also an important opportunity to consider how to prevent future <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreaks. It is clear that diseases like polio, tuberculosis, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria">malaria</a></span>, and yes <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreaks such as this, are diseases that thrive in impoverished broken states. While immediate responses are important the urgency of addressing poverty should not be lost. There will be calls for increased aid for Africa, however, a more sustainable strategy could be help Africa to retain it’s internally generated wealth that is currently lost through multi-national corporate tax evasion. The 2013 Africa Progress Report reveals that Africa loses more in tax evasion than it receives in international aid. Africa could recover more than double its current aid inflow if evaded taxes and other illicit outflows were controlled through international cooperation. Retaining the internally generated wealth within the country would be much more beneficial on a dollar for dollar basis than piecemeal and uncoordinated aid donations that distort local planning both in the short and long term. It is much healthier for a sovereign government to plan health and other societal infrastructure on their own tax base. Much of the tax is evaded by multi-national companies “selling” their products or assets out of Africa to shell companies in tax havens at ridiculously low prices so that no profit is recorded in Africa and no tax is payable in the tax haven. In 2012, the OECD launched Tax Inspectors without Borders to provide international auditing expertise and advice to help developing countries better address tax base erosion, including tax evasion and avoidance. While tax collection may eventually replace the need for medical and public health aid schemes, in the interim it may be that aid directed at tax collection enhancement schemes have better returns on investment than many public health projects. One project assisting Kenya’s tax administration, under the OECD “Taxes for Development” program, is reported as returning more than $1000 for every $1 invested. Basic sanitation and clean water programs (which are incredibly important) generally have returns of less than $10 for every $1 invested. This is not an argument to drop water and sanitation programs in Africa but to highlight the importance of tax reform as a development initiative. Additionally, by considering the broader issues of tax evasion this may temper the potentially “victim blaming” argument that African countries are being penny wise and pound foolish in their allocation of clinical versus preventive investments. “Tax Inspectors without Borders” is not nearly so sexy a concept as “Doctors without Borders” and I cannot imagine what the fundraising brochures would look like. (Nerdy accountants pouring through files trying to track corporate finance flows does not quicken the heartbeat.) But they might save a lot of lives and even prevent future <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreaks.

                                Tony Abbott has deployed his senior ministers, including Julie Bishop and George Brandis, to get out the government's anti-terrorism message.AAP/Lukas Coch It appears that Australia might be put on a higher threat alert level. ASIO director-general David Irvine’s comments on a possible increase in the terrorism threat level (which came into force in 2003) have created a wave of flurry, concern and nervous anticipation. As Irvine explained: The notion of a threat level at medium is that an attack is possible or could occur. If we raise it to high it means an attack is likely. Certainly, a fundamental security challenge is how intelligence and police agencies can best deal with potential home-grown terrorists and their allies. For instance, Britain has raised its threat level to “severe” in response to events in Iraq and Syria. So how should the Australian government and its citizens best respond? Back to the future Despite Osama Bin Laden receiving a bullet to the head in May 2011 and a weakened al-Qaeda - which is on the run and characterised by paralysis, incompetence and infighting - Australia’s terrorism threat level is potentially poised to rise to from medium to high for the first time since inception. This seems to revolve around deteriorating conflicts in the Middle East, the evils of Islamic State (IS) and Sunni militia groups and salvos about “Aussie jihadists”. About 60 Australians are reportedly fighting in either Iraq or Syria. Yet every measure put forward to manage the threat of citizens being involved with extremist groups abroad should not be understood as automatically acceptable or validated. A plausible strategy for countering IS has not yet been clearly articulated. And talking more openly about the greatest sources of funding for IS, including the role of Saudi Arabia, would inject a bit more honesty and intricacy into the debate. It is worth noting that over that past decade many have argued that Australia’s decision to join the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 was never a straight-forward “mission accomplished”. Rather it ultimately exacerbated existing ethnic and religious tensions, in turn making Australia less safe from terrorism. It directly led to the “balkanisation” of Iraq. Adding insult to injury, purported WMDs eventually stood for “weapons of mass disappearance”, while the dictator Saddam Hussain had no direct relationship with the tragedy of 9/11. The ‘Team Australia’ narrative This has been a muddying period of scatter-gun political exchanges, mixed security narratives and gloomy media reporting. We have, for instance, had the Abbott government insist that renewed or enlarged participation in military operations in Iraq and Syria will not put Australia at increased risk. Yet both intelligence agencies and government have been anxious to win support for expanded powers under new security legislation. Similarly, while team Abbott has appeared eager to focus on an escalating terrorist situation at home and abroad, security assessments have not been in lock-step with political attempts to jump-start a new dialogue of national security menace. The threat status remained stubbornly unchanged. Revisiting the terror: the Howard government fridge magnet from a decade ago. This might change. Yet the stronger terror assessment scenario painted by ASIO does seem rather odd. Irvine chose to speculate publicly about the threat alert being raised to the second-highest level, ostensibly before giving formal advice to the government. Based on ongoing assessments, either a threat is likely to occur or it is not. If so, why the delay? If not, why prematurely raise a “worst-case” scenario? Citizens remain stuck in terror limbo. Further, this drip-feed of vague warnings is being packaged by policymakers with a hyper-legislative insistence on introducing another round of “tough” terror laws. While some measures appear justifiable – such as up-to-date powers to suspend passports - many others do not. Some proposals remain decidedly inconsistent with past recommendations by watchdogs like the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. Overall, it can be argued that many shortcomings and the lack of practical fine-tuning evident in core elements of Australia’s counter-terrorism legislation are the result of undue haste. Governments have rushed to pass laws without appropriate scrutiny and related checks and balances. We seem to be stuck on a rinse-and-repeat cycle to keep terrorising ourselves. A fine line between public alert and panic The head of ASIO publicly musing about terror threats has undoubtedly had a virtually identical impact to the anticipated actual adjustment (or non-adjustment) of the National Terrorism Public Alert System. It has grabbed headlines and accelerated political chatter and public speculation. Problematically, this has created rolling confusion. Much work remains to be done to keep uncertainty about terrorism in perspective. The alert system has limited usefulness in guiding people’s movements. It is not tied to any specific action – unless self-imposed and completely arbitrary. Do we stay home? Do we avoid public transport or airports or crowded movie theatres or the AFL final series? Do we shun strangers with beards? Do we re-read (or re-find) our Howard government-issued fridge magnets for instructions while setting our mobile phones to automatically dial the terrorist hotline when our spider-sense tingles (sorry, I can never remember the number)? This type of “alert and alarmed” scenario tends to lead in a couple of directions: it either creates wider public paranoia or greater public scepticism. Neither is particularly helpful for an effective, sustainable and clear-eyed counter-terrorism strategy. When warned about terrorism, public fears come to the fore regardless of advice to stay calm. Serving the terrorists' agenda A variety of policymakers and media are doing their best to contribute to the manipulation of revived fears about terrorism. Social media in particular have become highly effective in spreading violent extremist ideology and propaganda. Brutal decapitations such as that of American journalist James Foley are instantaneously available worldwide. But imagine that the most effective weapon against the West for the IS is actually terror. Imagine that terrorists are hoping to provoke shock and fear; they aim to terrorise. Imagine that these ugly videos are entirely ineffective in changing the direction of the US in its involvement with expanded air campaigns and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> strikes against IS. That would leave the only substantial impact these beheadings can have on Western audiences as a psychological one of building IS into a sort of shadowy, omnipresent super-villain that is hell-bent on world domination. Yet the noise emanating from IS is mostly crude bluff and ludicrous chest-beating. It is critical to match its well-echoed and grandiose intentions with a calculation of its actual capacity to form a self-proclaimed caliphate throughout the Middle East, North Africa and large parts of western Asia and Europe. This capacity is zero. It is based on an illusion. IS is a threat to specific people in parts of Iraq and Syria. It might dictate terms within some lawless and poorly defended areas. But IS does not have the ability to march into Pakistan. Or to take Baghdad (being “close” to Bagdad does not count). In fact, this splinter movement has struggled to hold the riverside town of Dhuluiya, which is part of a belt of Sunni Muslim towns. IS is in ongoing battles not only with US hellfire missiles but with rival jihadist, terrorist and rebel groups. As al-Qaeda eventually realised, the IS brand of savagery and its core blood-thirsty organisation will continue to alienate support from both local and global Islamic communities. In short, IS is a nasty piece of work, but it is not a global game-changer. Frustratingly, while making nonsensical noises about IS power, reach and authority, it is head-shaking that the Prime Minister would then reward IS propaganda by implying that such unbridled violence and accompanying beheadings could happen on Australian soil before long. The instinct to “do something” and heroic calls to strong vigilant action might be good politics. However, such heavy-handedness is a careless and unhealthy national security stratagem. What next? The bad news is that the conflict in Iraq and Syria will remain an incubator for a new generation of terrorists. While individual motivations and profiles will vary, foreign fighters from all parts of the globe are joining the combat. The problem of war travellers who go to fight in foreign locations and return home after operating in radicalising environments is a serious security challenge. Issues like detaining or arresting citizens before they have left for a conflict zone – without solid evidence - will continue to be complicated. The good news is that the threat of foreign fighters is both manageable and marginal. The coherence and capabilities of the IS splinter group should not be overstated. Another bottom line is that these Australian foreign fighters do not represent the wider Islamic community – IS is keen to kill all Muslims who they deem to be “infidels”. (This makes many calls for “community” solutions by the overwhelming moderate Muslim majority in Australia overly simplistic.) Henry Kissinger reminds us that terrorists simply can’t match state-based threats. EPA/Michael Reynolds This is not a clash of civilisations. Australian citizens still have more chance of being killed by bee stings or car crashes than by a rare, albeit conceivable, home-grown terrorist attack. Interestingly, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger recently warned that traditional state-based threats remain a much more serious and long-term security headache. I consider Iran a bigger problem than ISIS. ISIS is a group of adventurers with a very aggressive ideology. But they have to conquer more and more territory before they can became a strategic, permanent reality. The lesson is not to dismiss the IS threat but to respond in a proportionate, carefully calibrated fashion, to avoid hyping terror risks and to invest in smart counter-radical campaigns. The building of public resilience - the ability of society to restore calm and for citizens to adapt rationally to random events and unexpected changes (from terror strikes to shark attacks) - remains indispensable. The more immediate hazard is pointless overreaction and political exploitation of public fears. The build-up of these kind of tensions have had a track-record of leading into knee-jerk and totally counter-productive policy initiatives – like the unnecessary Iraq invasion of 2003. That had no clear national security benefit and contributed to much of this latest mess.

                                This progression is known as Moore’s law. For more than 100 years, the processing power of computers had doubled every 18 months. Computers and the information technology that they enable are absorbing other fields. So we are seeing exponential advances in sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, 3D printing, and so on.

                                IN 2012 China’s main planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, declared that the country would produce 60 billion-100 billion cubic metres of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> a year in 2020. It needed those forecasts to be accurate.They weren’t. Wu Xinxiong, the director of China’s National Energy Administration, recently predicted that only 30 billion cubic metres a year will come on stream by 2020. That would barely meet 1% of China’s energy needs now, let alone in 2020.This is profoundly disappointing. With more than 30 trillion cubic metres of recoverable <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span>, China has the largest reserves in the world, almost 70% more than in America, home of the shale-gas revolution. It is also a setback to the country’s efforts to reduce pollution. Dirty coal now makes up about 70% of energy consumption and, despite fast growth in renewable energy, gas is the only cleanish energy source that could displace enough coal to rein in carbon emissions quickly.China has found that replicating America’s shale strategy—even with American help—is harder than it expected. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fracking">Fracking</a></span> works by injecting millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale and releasing gas. American shale seams are mostly found in easily accessible areas at quite shallow depths, and formed of rock that is easy to fracture. China’s are mostly deeper,...
