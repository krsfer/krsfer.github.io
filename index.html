                                Geneva (AFP) - The number of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> infections will triple to 20,000 by November, soaring by the thousands every week if efforts are not significantly stepped up to stop the outbreak, the WHO warned Tuesday. "Without drastic improvements in control measures, the numbers of cases of and deaths from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> are expected to continue increasing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months," the World Health Organization said in a study. The current outbreak in West Africa has already claimed more than 2,800 lives and infected more than 5,800 people. But the WHO study forecasts that if no significant action is taken, "the cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases by November 2 ... will be 5,925 in Guinea, 9,939 in Liberia and 5,063 in Sierra Leone". The total for those three countries alone will therefore surpass 20,000 cases, said the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday. That would also translate to a jump in the number of deaths as the experts suggest that the fatality in the current outbreak is much higher than the widely estimated one in two. If only cases of deaths and recovery were taken into account, the fatality rate stands at about 71 percent, the study showed. "We are seeing exponential growth and we need to act now," said Christopher Dye, co-author of the study jointly carried out with the Imperial College in London. "If we don't stop the epidemic very soon, this is going to turn from a disaster into a catastrophe," he told reporters in Geneva, warning that the epidemic might simply "rumble on as it has for the last few months for the next few years." "The fear is that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> will become more or less a permanent feature of the human population," warned Dye, who is the UN health agency's head of strategy.   - 'Mobile populations' -   <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> fever can fell its victims within days, causing severe muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and -- in many cases -- unstoppable internal and external bleeding. It is one of the deadliest viruses known to man, and the current outbreak, which quietly began in southern Guinea last December, has by far killed more than all other <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreaks combined. Prior to the current epidemic, the deadliest outbreak was the very first one on record, in Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976, when 280 people died. But Dye said the virus ravaging west Africa was acting similarly to previous outbreaks. What has changed is the increasing mobility of the population affected. "These are large, highly mobile, well-interconnected populations," he said. Cultural practices like washing and touching dead bodies have compounded the problem, leading to the widespread contagion of the virus -- which is transmitted by body fluids contact. The very slow response in countries never before hit by the virus as well as by the international community had also allowed the virus to take hold, he said. Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology at the Imperial College, who co-authored the study also pointed to the weak health systems in the three hardest-hit countries -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. "In Nigeria, for example, where health systems are stronger, the number of cases has so far been limited, despite the introduction of infection into the large cities of Lagos and Port Harcourt," she said.   Join the conversation about this story »

                                Spectators can attribute the positive qualities of the sport they're watching to the supplements and sports drinks being promoted. vijay chennupati/Flickr, CC BY-SA Sporting bodies shouldn’t unconditionally accept sponsorship from nutritional supplements and sports drinks companies because a link with sports lends undue credibility to these unproven products. In an article just published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, my colleague and I argue such sponsorship misleads the public into thinking the products are inevitably good for health, fitness, and well-being. Sport sponsorship – and its promotional cousin celebrity endorsement – can deliver massive mutual benefits. Consider the Nike–Michael Jordan relationship: basketball participation expanded, and Jordan became the world’s most recognisable athlete while Nike became the planet’s dominant sports shoe supplier. But sponsorship can also be problematic. During the 1970s and 1980s, for instance, the tobacco industry embedded itself in sport, and often paid for the naming rights for events and leagues. In the light of incontrovertible evidence that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer and other ill health, governments banned direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products. The vacuum this left was quickly filled by multinational food and beverage companies, such as Coca Cola, Nestle, and McDonald’s, alongside alcohol brands. These are by no means health-promoting products, and despite their link with sports, don’t add to their legitimacy. But sponsorship by nutritional supplement and sports drinks companies is more complicated. These products appear to encourage healthy living, and exercise, and both are linked to the ethos of sport, which is to fine-tune the body’s capacity to perform. Amino acids help build muscle, for instance, while high-energy drinks can stall the onset of fatigue. Still, there’s a problematic side to the regular use of supplements and sports drinks; the health and performance benefits of many of the products remain unproven. While a beverage with high levels of caffeine might provide a short-term energy boost, its effect can be severely moderated by the dose, the time when it’s taken, and the nature of the sporting activity. And while multivitamin capsules are promoted as immune system stimulants and energy boosters, supporting evidence is thin. Supplements and sports drinks can also have serious health implications. Advertising implies these products are benign but large doses of caffeine can trigger irregular heart rhythm, and lead to anxiety attacks. And a daily diet of energy drinks can lead to obesity and diabetes because of their sugar content. To athletes, supplements also pose a risk of doping as they sometimes contain prohibited substances. Ingesting prohibited substances lead to sanctions regardless of any intention or knowledge of their presence. These problems are compounded when the products are linked to sponsorship deals because spectators attribute the positive qualities of the sport they’re watching to the product being promoted. The link can lead to a seamless association whereby the product (in this case nutritional supplements and sport drinks) comes to be seen as not only as integral to sport, but also part of the overall experience. By accepting their sponsorship, various sporting codes lend unwarranted credibility to products that would not otherwise be seen as beneficial or healthy. The issue has already prompted disquiet among sporting authorities, and many sports organisations have publicly distanced themselves from claims about their endorsement of supplement use. The American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine have issued a joint statement highlighting how supplements only benefit specific sports (creatine use for high-intensity sports, such as weight lifting and sprinting, for instance). They also point out that the majority of the supplements on the market fall into the category of ergogenic <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span> that do not perform as claimed. Similarly, the Irish Rugby Football Union recently noted: the increased popularity of such products, across all ages and all sports, may be due to a lack of understanding of the claims made by manufacturers, many of which are not backed up by scientific evidence. Meanwhile, the World Anti-Doping Authority (WADA) says the use of dietary supplements is cause for concern because their manufacture and labels aren’t regulated. And this could mean supplements contain undeclared substances that are prohibited under anti-doping regulations. These statements stand in stark contrast to the ubiquitous supplements and drinks sponsorship of sports teams and events. The unease sporting authorities feel about endorsing these products is cause for caution about nutritional supplements and sports drink consumption and sponsorship. While it may not be sufficient for sporting codes to ditch such sponsorship, it should warn them against entering arrangements without first undertaking a “due diligence” test.

                                Head and neck cancer underway. Akira Kouchiyama, CC BY-SA Immune cells in the blood primarily defend us against infection. But we’re now learning that these cells can also keep us free from cancer. Patients with less efficient immune systems such as organ transplant recipients or those with untreated <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, for example, are more susceptible to cancers. It is also becoming increasingly apparent that we can use immune cells to predict survival in people who do develop cancer. And that, in fact, there are immune cells within cancers. The number of immune cells inside a tumour can hugely vary: some patients have vast numbers while some have very few. In a recent study, we showed that in head and neck cancers, the survival of a patient depends on how many immune cells are within the tumour. This could be a valuable way of individualising cancer treatments. Patients with lots of immune cells, for example, could be offered less toxic cancer treatment while those with few immune cells may need more aggressive treatment to improve their chances of survival. Not all immune cells within the tumour are able to “attack” the cancer. By looking at specific cell markers – proteins on the cell exterior that allow us to see whether, for example, cells are exhausted – we can determine which individual immune cells in the tumour will be effective in tackling the cancer, or if they are exhausted and not able to perform any useful function. It’s possible that these exhausted cells could be reinvigorated to become useful again with targeted immunotherapy treatments currently in development. These include vaccines, so if a cancer has been caused by a virus, we can vaccinate the patient with a short segment of the same virus to encourage the immune system to react to it. Around 30% of head and neck cancers, for example, are the result of human papillomavirus (HPV). There has been a 225% increase in these types of cancers over the past 15-20 years and in the US, HPV will cause more of these cancers than cervical ones. In these cases, cancer cells continue to express part of the HPV on their surface. The hope is that following vaccination, immune cells will be better able to identify these HPV cancer cells and kill them. For people who simply don’t have many immune cells in tumours, specific, targeted immunotherapy could be one option. But also broader “brush stroke” treatments. These broader treatments cover all immunotherapies that encourage a patient’s immune system in a fairly non-specific way. Our immune cells are normally very tightly regulated and include many fail-safe systems to prevent them from over-reacting primarily to infections. General immunotherapy takes the brakes off and allows the immune cells to react to the cancer cells. It may be that a combination of specific vaccine and non-specific immune treatments could be enough in combination to tip the balance in favour of the patient’s immune system so that it is able to overcome the cancer. We’re going to further investigate how immune cells might help us to fight cancer and two head and neck cancer immunotherapy trials are due to start at the University of Southampton in the next six months. One of these trials will look at a HPV cancer vaccine, while the other will investigate a non-specific immunotherapy molecule for those 70% of patients that develop head and neck cancer independent of HPV. Our hope is that within five years the results of these trials could influence the way we treat cancers. Emma King receives funding from CRUK.

                                Knowing your DNA will is not a panacea. PA/Harvard University Walter Gilbert won the Nobel Prize in 1980 in Chemistry for his contribution to sequence DNA, or “determination of base sequences in a nucleic acid”. Mohit Kumar Jolly, researcher at Rice University and contributor to The Conversation, interviewed him at the 2014 Lindau Nobel Laureates Meeting. You received the Nobel Prize for DNA sequencing. When do you think we will be able to get our genomes sequenced cheaply? Sequencing is definitely becoming cheaper and more accessible. One can sequence a couple of full genomes today for less than US$50,000. In 1985, human DNA sequencing cost was thought to be around US$3 billion. I hope that by 2020, drug stores can do genome sequencing for a few hundred dollars. But, one must be careful – whole genome sequencing is not at all accurate for medical diagnosis. I got my own genome sequenced, but they missed the local rearrangements in my genome – it was not well-curated. Also, it is common belief that once we can sequence the genome, we can edit it to have babies with higher IQ for example. This is a myth, because it is very rare that one gene corresponds to one property. What do you think about the prospects of personalised medicine? I support the cause of personalised medicine. I believe that it has two underlying themes – each one of us has different metabolism and each one of us has a different manifestation of the same disease. My cancer is not the same as your cancer, so the only way one can categorise ultimately is to have a limited number of subtypes and then develop drugs against those subtypes. But as you can see, big pharma companies of course do not want people to believe in personalised medicine. Otherwise how would they sell their generic drugs? I don’t understand why they don’t realise that clinical trials get easier and much cheaper with subtyping – they do not play this market game well. What are your views on “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>”? <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big data">Big data</a></span> promises to collect large sets of data and find associations between genes and diseases. There’s definitely something useful in the data collected, but the danger is that we have no clue how to interpret it. Also, you must remember that all statistically significant things are not biologically significant. So, it is definitely not a panacea. There was a recent controversy about patenting genes. What did you make of that? I agree with the US Supreme Court decision that one cannot patent anything that exists naturally. Since a gene is a part of the genome, I don’t think one should be allowed to patent it. But companies are allowed to patent some genetic tests that identify risks for certain diseases based on one’s genes. What problems does science face today? We are spending money on problems that can have immediate outcomes. Then we are forced to use only our current level of understanding. There is a lot that what we don’t know. Imagine that if we had asked Benjamin Franklin to justify the importance of the “spark” he had found, would we have had electricity today? Another major problem is the explosion in scientific manpower that has not necessarily led to the betterment of science, especially in biology. In fact, bad material that gets published has increased. In biology, the top journals – Cell, Science and Nature – have created a mess. They tell the authors “give me the headline, not the data”. And then we see retractions and shattered careers and dreams. What advice would you like to give to young scientists? Do not blindly believe whatever you read. I often used to give my students papers that said opposite things and then tell them to explain to me how they were consistent, if at all. Also, do not continue science if it does not excite you. Science cannot be a nine-to-five job.

Previously, the WHO has warned that 20,000 could be infected before the disease is contained. Today's report is less optimistic. Already there have been more than 4,000 confirmed cases and almost 2,300 confirmed deaths from the disease, but those numbers are almost certainly underestimates, according to WHO data published by the New England Journal of Medicine.

                                A toaster oven with its side panel ripped off is sitting on a table, its electrical guts exposed. One guy is huddled over it, stripping and soldering wires together in ways the manufacturer never intended. Another guy is busy typing away at his laptop, while two teammates are closely examining a microwave to see if they can subject it to the same fate as the toaster. It's so useful. You'll be able to perfectly cook chicken, Mayank Gulati, the one mangling the toaster oven said to me. It's eleven hours into Hack the North, Canada's largest and first ever international hackathon, and the team is trying to make a bunch of household appliances controllable through a smartphone. Roughly 1,000 people, or about 250 teams, descended on the University of Waterloo's campus for the hackathon. Most participants, some from schools as far away as the Netherlands and China, came armed with their laptops. The rules were simple: create something awesome using available technology within 36 hours and then pitch it to a panel of judges in 100 seconds or less. The hack in hackathon, refers to the old-school definition: finding a creative, unconventional way to manipulate technology, in unintended ways. The basic idea of the event is to throw a bunch of code-smart, creative, builder-types, into the same space for a day and a half—then see the impressive results by the end of it. Add in some old and brand new hardware to the mix, like Thalmic's Myo armband—which senses electrical activity from wearers' muscles to tell what gestures and rotations their arms are making—and you're in for some interesting inventions. Canada's Hack the North was inspired by American hackathons like MHacks, an annual event hosted at the University of Michigan. We [the organizers] had been to these hackathons [in the U.S.] just as participants and we were just blown away. And we were thinking, 'Why doesn't this happen at Waterloo? This needs to come to Waterloo,' said co-organizer Valentin Tsatskin. And we were like, 'Okay, let's do it!' Close to a year of planning later and the Waterloo students made Hack the North come together with tech industry sponsors like Bloomberg, Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla and Yelp, while Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky, 500px CEO Andy Yang, and Brilliant CEO and founder Sue Khim, judged the event. The Engineering 5 building at U of Waterloo, normally used for classes and student lounges, became ground zero, with hackers spread out on all six floors. The lobby in another nearby engineering building was converted into a makeshift nap area with hammocks and mats strewn everywhere. Besides the main hacking project, participants also attended a variety of talks and workshops throughout the weekend, taking part in midnight coding challenges on Sunday, where four tablets were awarded to the winners. Let's start the mother fucking microwave demo, yelled David Fontenot, from the toaster oven and microwave team, into his phone Sunday morning. Seconds later, the microwave timer set itself to 99:99 and the plate inside began spinning. After hours of hacking, the microwave and toaster oven were fully operational over smartphone voice commands, with the cooking temperatures adjustable, and the system sending out texts after the cooking was complete. The judges chose ten winning teams Sunday afternoon (sadly, Fontenot's team didn't make the cut). Some of the winning hacks included Lend, a website that connects users who want to rent objects, described as an Airbnb for things. The same hackers also created a mobile-compatible version with a functioning <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> client. Another winning hack—Open Pokmon—is an Android application that renders real-life maps into Pokmon-style graphics, allowing users to fight wild Pokmon anywhere, and challenge other users they encounter on the map, to battles. The game is also activated through voice-command, so users literally tell their Pokmon what attacks to use. One team created a special door lock that can be unlocked by tapping a smartphone with a corresponding app installed on it. The owner of the lock can give people access based on Facebook events. If someone is listed as "going" to your party, instead of answering the door a hundred times, guests can tap their phones to the lock and unlock the door. But if your party friends switch their statuses to "not going," they won't be able to unlock it. Considering the participant and sponsor turnout, Hack the North is on the rise and this likely won't be its last year. There's also no surprise the event was held in Waterloo—a huge tech hub in Canada, with U of Waterloo serving as Canada's engineering mecca and one of the top 50 universities in that discipline worldwide. And the entire event is a sign of Canada's growing prominence in the technology sector, with big corporate sponsors in attendance (likely for recruitment), giving talented students the platform to not just showcase their inventions, but themselves, to elite tech sector players.  Ultimately, with companies like Facebook in the US already embracing similar hackathon culture—Hack the North shows the same thinking is north of the border in Canada, too.

                                Apple is building an enormous new ring-shaped campus for its headquarters in Cupertino, California, the design and overall futuristic qualities of which have inspired the nickname "the Spaceship campus." Although construction on the campus (actual name Campus 2) has scarcely begun, Apple CEO Tim Cook is already boasting that that the building will be great for the rest of us earthlings who won't work there. Speaking today at the environmental nonprofit event Climate Week NYC, Cook said "we're building a new headquarters that I think will be the greenest building on the planet." (his comments start 1:15 into this video). <span class='elision'>Continue reading…</span>

                                The CIA has notoriously been, well, "innovative" in developing new interrogation techniques (if you consider waterboarding an innovation, at least). Newly declassified documents reveal that willingness to experiment is nothing new: 30 years ago, the spy agency pitted one of its own agents against an artificial intelligence interrogator. The documents in question, written in 1983 and titled Interrogation of an Alleged CIA Agent, describe a series of experimental tests conducted in the early 1980s in which the CIA repeatedly interrogated its own agent, referred to in the report as Joe Hardesty, using a primitive AI called Analiza. The declassified document is both fascinating in its distinct retrofuture flavour and eerily prescient nature, because the US government is now set to use virtual entities to conduct national security interviews. Its also kind of hilarious, because the interrogation transcript reads like a conversation with a really frustrating chatbot. Heres a slice: AI: You had better straighten out your attitude, Joe, or it will be a long time before you ever leave this country. Hardesty: What do you mean by that crack? AI: You know what I mean. Hardesty: No, I do not. AI: Think about it. Hardesty: Why? AI: Why do you want to know why? Hardesty: You made a threat and I want an explanation. AI: I think the message is clear. Hardesty: What message? AI: Do you work for the American Central Intelligence Agency? Hardesty: Hell, no. AI: Why do you persist in lying to me? Hardesty: I am not lying. You have no right to treat me like this. The intelligence on display in the transcript is clearly undeveloped, and seems to contain a mixed bag of predetermined threats made to goad interrogation subjects into spilling their secrets as well as open-ended lines of questioning.  According to the document, Analiza consisted, in part, of a crude machine learning algorithm that stored Hardestys responses in its memory, along with a pre-set question bank that it could draw from. Other aspects of the program are probing Joes vulnerabilities, the document stated. AI records focus variables, Joes tendency to concentrate on various subjects, and profile variables to serve as indicators of Joes hostility, inquisitiveness, talkativeness, and understandability, and to pose questions about these. When your captor is a machine, there is no humaneness to be found, and, hence, no one to plead with Even way back then, the authors had a striking vision for future virtual entities that can learn on their own, adapt, and think abstractly. According to the document, the CIA believed it was possible that computers could adapt, pursue goals, modify themselves or other computers, and think abstractly.  Potential applications for computer algorithms like Analiza could include training recruits before they head into the field and face the risk of an interrogation with a human opponent, according to the document. The CIA, like the field of artificial intelligence itself, has come a long way since the 1980s, and algorithms that attempt to mimic brain processes (referred to as Advanced Neural Networks) like those being developed by Google have achieved many of the goals the CIA set decades ago. The agency itself is heavily invested in AI development today by way of its venture firm, In-Q-Tel, which recently gave a funding boost to Narrative Science, a company developing AI that can glean insight from data and turn it into a semi-readable news article. Enhanced interrogation techniques may very well take on a new, unsettling meaning if the CIAs technological fever dream of the 80s ever comes to fruition. AI interrogation, while presumably less violent and repugnant than waterboarding, for example, could present its own set of moral transgressions. When your captor is a machine, there is no humaneness to be found, and, hence, no one to plead with. When even that small avenue of humanity is done away with in the proceedings of state-sponsored barbarism, what is left? Illegal detainments could continue with only slight human involvement. Even though decades worth of development have passed since the CIAs initial dabbling with AI interrogation techniques, virtual entities that can converse naturally with humans are still far off.  The recent case of chatbot <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Eugene Goostman">Eugene Goostman</a></span>, which passed the Turing Test through trickery rather than genuine intelligence, demonstrated this. Even so, with government agencies like the CIA, DARPA, and powerful corporations like Google on the case, the possibility might be closer than we think.

                                In the distant future, if humanity is looking back on the 21st century from the comfort of a climate that is merely seriously disfigured and not catastrophically fucked, then teachers, parents, and historians may point to images of the Peoples Climate March that flooded the streets of New York City when they explain the story of how the worst was averted. That was the moment, after all, when close to 400,000 people from around the world peacefully overwhelmed the heart of Manhattan, in late September of 2014, making their voices heard after two decades of pitiful inaction from politicians and world leaders. This piece of history will be vividly illustrated: Clips from aerial footage of the event, embedded in future students' heat-and-water-resistant digitextbooks, will definitively illustrate the sheer number of people that left home to spend their Sunday in the streets, protesting a sweltering future ushered in by corporate profits. The accompanying collage of photographs, Instagrams, and tweeted pics will make it easy to empathize with the members of the vast throng that followed the same route as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, former Vice President Al Gore, and  Leonardo DiCaprio. The march may not have been the single moment that changes everything, as its chief organizers—350.org, which, now, in 2014, isnt quite the household name it is in the far future—described it. But it was the best cultural, social, and visual demonstration that on climate, everything is changing. And thats crucially important. For years, opinion surveys have clearly shown that people care about climate change. Poll after poll after poll indicated that a majority of Americans would support laws that reduce carbon emissions. The climate change-related <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span> and Keystone XL movements have drawn fierce support, and produced some memorable demonstrations. Occupy had a contingent that focused heavily on climate change. But theres been no single, major action that united protesters expressly around climate change itself, not nearly on this scale. The Cophenhagen climate march drew 80,000 people, and the Forward on Climate March in Washington DC drew over 35,000. The Peoples Climate March was ten times that. Now, it seems crazy (and a little disheartening) that its taken this long to see a movement emerge in full force like this, given how long nonprofits, clean energy companies, activists, artists, and certain public leaders have labored to bring attention to the issue. The day the climate movement came of age. It took 25 years, but better late than never — Bill McKibben (@billmckibben) September 21, 2014 Crazy that in all the years that climate has been a pressing issue, theres been nothing like this—not a single revolutionary climate protest moment. That theres never been a particular event that politicians and pundits could point to as the embodiment of public discontent with climate change. A pure distillation of the concern and anger—and fear—that climate change inspires in the populace. Thats what the Peoples Climate March gives us. A clear-as-crystal referent for anyone whos wondering whether ordinary people consider climate change a pressing issue.  400,000 people: Thats the widely accepted attendance estimate as it currently stands. Some reports noted that NYPD police scanners put the estimates as high as 600,000. That's enough to make it not just the largest-ever climate march, which it definitely was, but maybe even the largest protest march of the last decade, period.  The images convey that scale: a packed crowd stretching for miles down Manhattans 8th and 6th Avenues. It goes as far as the eye can see. Occupy never drew a crowd like this; the Tea Partys never even come close. All of those images of the packed streets form a definitive tapestry, a visual record that can now be deployed as irrefutable proof that the climate issue animates bodies. And, importantly, that in an increasing range of cases, its clearly a political winner to back. People's Climate March Now, every time a politician argues 'we can't afford to act,' this will stand as an omnipresent counterpoint—400,000 people feel pretty strongly otherwise. That just didn't exist before. Again, weve known this stuff for a while; the data has shown that people support fighting climate change and funding clean energy and so forth. But politicians see poll numbers roll by all the time—the great lesson of the Obama-Romney election was that politicians ignore the data at their own peril. But Romney ignored the data anyway, lost, and, in the process, illustrated a second lesson of that election—even though its enormously stupid to do so, ignoring the numbers is still common practice. Politicos ignore hordes of peaceful, determined, and hopeful people, too, but its a bit harder. Its beyond informed speculation and phone polls, and part of the cultural fabric now. Now, every time a politician argues 'we can't afford to act' or 'the science isn't settled', this march will stand as an omnipresent counterpoint—400,000 people feel pretty strongly otherwise. That just didn't exist before.  Everyone I spoke to at the march—representatives from Bangladesh, which is threatened by rising seas, members of the 1199 SEIU union, environmental educators, even the police officers regulating the event—were thrilled to be there, and spoke with urgency about the need to address global warming.  Still, humanity has much work left to do if it hopes to avoid the worst impacts of global warming; to avoid a future where a handful of elites tell the story of that beautiful but futile climate march as they eke out their days in fortified domes in northern Canada. The latest climate science brings ever-worse news, after all. New Scientist describes the newest emissions study as follows: "World on track for worst case warming scenario." And politicians still remain at a grave impasse, especially in the US, the last bastion for climate change deniers who want to be taken seriously. Thanks to them, legislative action to reduce carbon emissions in the richest and most culpable nation on Earth remains a lofty dream, even in the face of such massive people power. And now that the gates have been opened to the climate movement, we can assume that this is only the beginning; a new era of protest has begun. But all it takes is a tipping point. Al Gore, who marched on Sunday, recently told me that he was amazed to see how quickly politicians embraced restrictive tobacco laws, one after another, even in tobacco-heavy states—after a certain point, after years of drawn-out battles. The same is true with gay marriage laws, which are changing faster than anyone could have imagined a decade ago. Now, in the People's Climate March—a momentous cultural artifact that captures the spirit of hundreds of thousands of worried global citizens—we may have seen our flashpoint on climate action, an historic, lightning-filled bauble that could lend its electricity to propelling our politics towards a point when everything does finally change. At the very least, it will prove an invaluable reference point and source of encouragement for future actions. At the most, it could help fuel a pivot between two possible futures—one in which humanity continues to thrive, and one in which were taking our history lessons in underground bunkers, waiting out the hot-as-hell days.

                                Foreign minister Julie Bishop (right) says Australians travelling to West Africa must ensure their employers can evacuate them if they become ill as the government will not. Alan Porritt/AAP Well over 5,300 people have been infected and over 2,600 have died in the current <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in West Africa. But these numbers are thought to be gross underestimates as even the most conservative projections now suggest a tenfold increase in deaths before we can hope to contain the outbreak. The international community has been slow to react to this unfolding humanitarian crisis, but in the past week new commitments have come from a variety of countries and institutions. So where is Australia in all this? Given the country is home to some of the world’s best-trained health-care workers and medical scientists, you might expect it to be sending teams of highly qualified people to help. Not helping, blocking The most notable assistance for the affected West African nations will arrive in the form of 3,000 US military personnel. They will help train health-care workers and build 17 new 100-bed patient care facilities. The United Kingdom has announced that it too is sending military personnel to the region to assist. The Chinese government has sent a mobile laboratory for testing for the virus and a 59-person team of epidemiologists, clinicians and nurses. Cuba has sent 165 health professionals. Late last week, the United Nations established a new mission for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> Emergency Response (UNMEER), and the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution (2177) declaring <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> “a threat to international peace and security”. This development alone, which is only the second time in the history of the UN Security Council that it has declared a health issue a security threat, speaks to the gravity of the outbreak. Back on our shores, some 12 Australian doctors have already travelled overseas with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to help care for the sick and dying. But they have done so independently and without any support from the Australian government. In fact, to date the government’s response has been disappointing to say the least. Last week, the prime minister announced he was offering A$2.5 million to MSF, which has been providing frontline care to those infected. This was the response of the non-governmental organisation: Médecins Sans Frontières cannot accept any donation of funds from the Australian government. We have been asking countries, including Australia, to evaluate their emergency medical and logistics capacity and make a contribution beyond financial support for over two weeks now and we continue to urge them to do so. Another A$2.5 million has been allocated to the World Health Organisation to help upscale its efforts. A further A$2 million will be provided to the UK government to support its frontline activities in Sierra Leone. Beyond this, the government has not only ignored calls from the Australian Medical Association to assist countries affected by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> by sending medical experts. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced last week that any Australians travelling to West Africa must ensure their employers can extract them if they become ill as the government “did not have the capacity to evacuate them”. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is a priority too Australia’s actions stand in clear contrast to the activities and measures offered by other countries, such as the US, the UK, China and Cuba. They also stand in stark contrast to the measures the government has proposed to combat the terror sect calling itself Islamic State (formerly ISIL or ISIS) in northern Iraq. These measures so far include an indeterminate commitment of over A$500 million per year and 600 troops. No rational individual can doubt that IS must be eliminated and that it will take considerable resources to do so. The Australian military is also ill-equipped to offer the type of assistance made available by the US and UK forces. Our military hasn’t been trained to do this type of work and we don’t have anywhere near enough military medical doctors and nurses to send overseas. Even so, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> poses a serious global threat and civilian health-care professionals are ready to be deployed. But the government’s refusal to guarantee it will help any Australian citizens come home if they get sick leaves the decision of whether people can go help to individual employers – and their insurance brokers. MSF has been overwhelmed by the need in West Africa; it is turning away patients because it simply doesn’t have the personnel or facilities to care for them. In the last few days, local health-care workers in some areas have been murdered over fears they may be spreading the virus. Money will undoubtedly be needed to help those governments affected by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> recover economically once this disaster is over. Until then, what is needed – and needed desperately, urgently – is people on the ground to help contain the outbreak. This means sending multidisciplinary teams of scientific, medical and humanitarian experts, supported by security personnel, to help as soon as possible. If left unchecked, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> poses just as big a threat to Australia’s national interests as Islamic extremists – both are conceivably just a plane ride away.

                                With all the conspiracy theories surrounding some high-profile deaths in recent years, how can you, theoretical whistleblower with highly sensitive documents, be assured that your information gets leaked if you're murdered in some government conspiracy? A new dark web service says it's got your back.  'Dead Man Zero' [deep web link] claims to offer potential whistleblowers a bit more peace of mind by providing a system that will automatically publish and distribute their secrets should they die, get jailed, or get injured. So what if something happens to you? the site reads. Especially if you're trying to do something good like blow the whistle on something evil or wrong in society or government. There should be consequences if you are hurt, jailed, or even killed for trying to render a genuine and risky service to our free society." "Now you have some protection. If 'something happens' to you, then your disclosures can be made public regardless, the site promises.  This is all accompanied by the obligatory image of 24's terrorist-fighting protagonist Jack Bauer, as you can see here: Screenshot: Dead Man Zero It claims to work in a very simple way. First, you upload your files, encrypted with a password, to a cloud storage service. Then you include this link, along with the password and an optional description of your material. The site will then add its own layer of encryption, too. You are then given your own unique URL to log in from, accessible only using the Tor browser.  If you don't log back into it once a day, week or month (those are the options), your documents and respective password will be published on the site, and sent to a list of email addresses that you provide in advance; most likely journalists you trust to do the story justice, or your lawyer. The site can also be accessed via a smart phone, assuming you can browse hidden services on it. If events overtake you, you can still overtake your adversaries, the site reads. For a user to upload their archive, they are required to pay 0.30 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> (around 70 or $120 at today's rate), and according to a counter on the site, 399 sets of documents have been uploaded, and 17 will be released if their owner doesn't log in within the next 24 hours. The creators have written that the site is in response to the series of NSA scandals over the years, and also point to a (since changed) article headlined Obama orders fed workers: spy on each other, alluding to the current administration's war on whistleblowers and leakers. I reached out to those behind Dead Man Zero via the contact form on the site, but didn't receive a reply. It's probably advisable to view Dead Man Zero and the service it offers with a healthy dose of scepticism There are a few things potential Snowdens should be aware of though. Firstly, what's to say the people running the site are going to do as they promise? Anyone who is going to leak highly sensitive documents from the upper echelons of government or private contractors probably already has experience in operational security, and would likely rather put faith in their own practices than a third party's. Indeed, Snowden was said to have his own 'dead man' system in place to release his documents—though security expert Bruce Schneier chimed in that it wasn't actually the best of ideas, considering someone might be tempted to kill Snowden, or stop him logging in, to purposely unleash the trove. Then there's the idea of uploading your material to the cloud first, which will no doubt worry those who are particularly security conscious. Even though Spideroak (one of the recommended services) deploys a supposed zero-knowledge method of keeping your data safe, those with a penchant for privacy are unlikely to store their secrets in the cloud.  Dead Man Zero counters that if they were to host your documents themselves, their own servers—potentially housing sensitive documents from all over the world—could be targeted. Finally, if would-be leakers simply forget to sign in when they say they will, well, they've just leaked a bunch of stuff they may not have wanted to. In sum, it's probably advisable to view Dead Man Zero and the service it offers with a healthy dose of scepticism.  In their FAQ section, the site creators address the question of whether they'll still be going in a year, or five or ten years. How do we know that? You really don't, they write. But 'we might know some folks' who have successfully run high-duty, highly secure (PCI-DDS at minimum) servers non-stop since 1993. That's 20 years. Chances are 'pretty good' you'll get the service you need. Just don't forget to log in when you say you will.

                                In the world, there are roughly 20 machines that can accurately simulate what it's like to fly a Predator <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>. All of them, save for one, is owned by or leased out to the US military to train those who will carry out targeted strikes or surveillance in the Middle East.  But the solitary one owned and operated by civilians is being used by researchers at the University of North Dakota to see how, exactly, the world's most infamous <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> might be able to be used here in the United States. WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ALL OF THIS AND SOMEHOW MOVE IT INTO A COMMERCIAL OR CIVILIAN REALM Predator <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s over the United States would be nothing new—the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection both fly unarmed versions of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> over the country, and NASA has had one since 2006.  Fittingly, a Predator has even been used, once, to help arrest someone a couple hours west of UND. The idea behind the university's program is that, someday, the Predator's use in the United States might become more widespread. "We're looking into the non-military, government, public use, and, maybe, commercial and civilian use of this technology," John Bridewell, a University of North Dakota professor overseeing the program, told me last week. Since 2012, the university has been using the Predator Mission Aircrew Training System, the most faithful simulator made by the Predator's manufacturer, General Atomics, to research both new ways of training Predator pilots and new ways of using the Predator in the United States.  According to General Atomics, "with PMATS, the level of realism between simulated exercises and real-world operations is virtually transparent." HOW CAN WE TAKE THIS AND MAKE IT FUN? Last week, I visited the university to learn more about its training programs. (Full disclosure: the North Dakota Chamber of Commerce wanted me to see the state's newly operational <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> test site so badly that it paid for my travel from NYC.) Unfortunately, access to the PMATS system is, as you might expect, highly restricted. It's held in a secure facility on the Grand Forks Air Force Base (though it's owned and operated by the university), and I was unable to see it in action (the photo you see above is the only press photo cleared for release). Even so, talking to the people working on the project was enlightening. The university's use of PMATS is twofold: First, the university is working in conjunction with the Air Force Research Laboratory to reform how military pilots are trained and, secondly, it's trying to figure out whether or not the Predator has a second life outside of its use as a targeted killing machine in the Middle East. Bridewell says that he and graduate students at the university (only American citizens are allowed to use or even see it, after a security-clearance process) have been working on new ways of training Predator pilots, including making the training more game-like. In January, the first class of 32 students began training on the device. Bridewell has also tried to simulate the simulator experience on standard computers, to make it more accessible. Image: DHS "We're working with pilots and sensor operators, which is what the Air Force has had difficulty training—we looked at it and thought, how can we take this and make it fun?" he told me. "We took ideas from gaming—we've got a built in tutorial, we have exercises, we've turned it into a game where you flash up something and a clock counts down to see if they can find it within a certain amount of time." On what the commercial or civilian use of Predators might be, the university is more guarded. Bridewell told me he isn't sure whether there will ever be a commercial entity that's allowed to own (or that would want to own) a Predator, but those are the questions he's trying to answer. "We hope to be able to take all of this and somehow move it into a commercial or civilian realm," he said. In a sense, that's already happened: Customs and Border Protection is a civilian agency, and it regularly flies the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s near the border (and it was a CBP <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> that helped local police in Grand Forks arrest a man in 2011). For a while, CBP agents trained on the university's simulator, according to Trevor Woods, a lead <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> piloting instructor at the university.  A CBP agent in North Dakota told me that the agency "assists every state, local, or federal agency" that asks for Predator support and that it flies <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s very regularly within US borders. There is, obviously, a lot of fear associated with the use of Predators, in particular, within the United States. If their use is going to become more common, it's going to be because of research carried out at the university.  "We're trying to segue this research into a broad, introductory curriculum," Woods said. "We'll be able to answer [the question of] 'What do you need to do if youre a commercial pilot and want to become a UAS pilot?"

                                Stretching the limits. Hey Mr Glen, CC BY-NC When I was younger, about ten years old, I realised that everyone ages and dies. And I thought well why should that be? Can’t we do something about it? I then thought I’d do it. I’ll study ageing and figure it out, and I’ll find a solution so people don’t have to age and die. And that’s what I do today. Ageing is a decrease in viability and an increase in vulnerability. It means your capacity to respond to external stresses and to function decreases, making you more vulnerable to diseases. One of the major causes of mortality in the elderly is influenza, which is just the common flu. The thing with ageing, of course, is that it entails different levels – molecular, cellular, hormonal and physiological – different organs and different systems in the body, which makes it very complex and relatively difficult to study. We actually don’t know much about ageing in the sense of its mechanisms – how and why we age. And what drives the process of ageing is still relatively poorly understood. If you look at it evolutionarily, our lifespan has only recently been so long. Life expectancy is affected by numerous factors such as better nutrition and availability of vaccines, has increased. Around 150 years ago it was something like 40-years-old, and 1,000 years ago about 25 (figures vary depending on whether child mortality and death in childbirth are included). But even as we increasingly reach what appear to be the limits of lifespan, there is likely still scope for even longer lifespans. Why do we age? There are hypotheses that damage to DNA probably affects cell renewal in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>, which in turn prevents repair in the body and contributes to loss of viability. Then there is the free radicals theory of ageing: the idea that as mitochondria in our cells burn energy with oxygen, it generates very highly reactive compounds, which creates damaging oxidative stress, which in turn accumulates with age and causes ageing. There are also things like telomeres, the tips of chromosomes that shorten with cell division. But because this also occurs with age (and is linked to cancer risk), people have said this drives the process of ageing. So after about age 30 your chances of dying double every eight years. This is fairly standard for human populations, no matter where you’re from or where you live. Third World countries may have higher mortality to begin with, but you still see this exponential increase in mortality. Longevity isn’t fixed But then you have very unique creatures. One example are birds. Now birds actually live longer than would be expected for them for their size, because they can fly and avoid predators. And one of the species that we are interested in is an organism called the naked mole rat, which lives for more than 30 years. Why? Because it lives in a protective environment. But then there is an evolutionary pressure to live longer. One of the interesting things about the naked mole rat is that it is extremely cancer resistant. There has not been a single case of cancer in hundreds of naked mole rats. So longevity is plastic. Not only there are species that live for much longer than we do, but there are species that appear not to age, like some species of turtles and tortoises. Probably one of the greatest breakthroughs in the field so far is that you can manipulate different genes and this can have a very significant impact on ageing. We know, for instance, that if you start manipulating DNA repair systems, in mice say, sometimes you get what looks like accelerated ageing. On the other hand, you can turn off a single gene in mice, like growth hormone receptor, and increase lifespan by 40%. Manipulating the system There are also interventions that modulate ageing. The most famous of them all is caloric restriction. Restricting the amount of calories animals eat (while maintaining essential nutrients like vitamins or minerals to keep them healthy) has been known for decades to expand lifespan in rodents by as much as 50%. And they’re also able to stay healthier for longer. It’s one of the things that we’re looking at in our lab, because if you know of a gene that mediates the affects of caloric restriction, then it may be a suitable target for drugs that have the same effects of caloric restriction but without you having to go on a diet – which most people don’t want to do. We do a mixture of bio-informatics and experimental work. We try to look for common patterns among genes to identify new genes that modulate longevity, and ones that regulate other genes. The thing to remember about our ageing in general is that it’s very time-consuming and expensive to do experiments. This is one of the problems of ageing research. But it has been calculated that slowing down the process of ageing by just seven years could cut in half the instances of age-related diseases at every single age. This would have a massive impact on the human lifespan, and on human health. I generally make the analogy of the Wright brothers, who built and flew the world’s first successful aircraft. They used to look at birds and say these birds are heavier than air and they can fly. If birds can fly, we can make aeroplanes. There is no law of nature that says ageing is immutable. On the contrary we know now that ageing is surprisingly plastic in the sense that it can be manipulated by genes, it can be manipulated by evolution and it can be manipulated by diet.

                                Those liquid crystals reveal a lot more. lazellion, CC BY-NC-ND Theoretical physicists are caricatured in the popular imagination as only involved in abstruse and difficult-to-imagine topics. But some of these theoretical physicists are involved in something closer to home: using artificial materials to understand how life works. One of the aims of doing so, they hope, is to invent new materials that can mimic some of the properties of living organisms. Spider silk, for example, is much stronger than the polymer kevlar, the strongest bullet-proof material. And whereas the skin of most living organisms is self-repairing, if you smash most artificial materials, there is little to do other than “phone the man”. The essence of life Not long ago the distinction between the living and non-living was simple to observe, if difficult to define. Religions endowed us with souls, which somehow gave us our ability to perceive the world. But the soul, in whatever living thing, was thought (and still is by many) to be independent of the material that the organism was made from and which departed when the organism died. Otto Lehmann. Wikimedia, CC BY Medieval philosophers theorised about the existence of an abstract distinction between life and non-life. In so doing, they divided themselves into monists, who denied a sharp divide, and the dualists, who affirmed it. In the 19th century, physicists such as Otto Lehmann, regarded as having discovered liquid crystals – a material that appears in a state between conventional liquids and solid crystals – and biologists such as Ernst Haeckel, speculated on a connection between physical chemistry and physiology. But these scientists’ perceptions of underlying reality attracted the mockery of contemporaries. This was partly because not enough physics and chemistry was known at the turn of the 20th century to provide a detailed mechanical picture of the operation of living organisms, nor even to provide convincing evidence that such a picture was possible. So reductionist approaches such as those offered by Lehmann and Haeckel needed as much faith as the religious picture it hoped to replace. It is different now. One of the top research councils in the UK is supporting a “physics of life” network, dedicated to winkling out the links between physical and biological law. With the rise of biochemistry and biophysics, theoretical physicists – through making mathematical models of key biochemical pathways, for example – can transform themselves in a trice into computational biologists, whose goal is to illuminate the function and mechanism of the 30,000 proteins found in the human body. Or, if the goal is to be more lucrative and short-term, they may digitally model the interactions between large molecules and design new drugs without sullying their hands in a laboratory. These days, headlines speak of organs being replaced by the fruit of industrial artifice, enzymes replaced by chemicals, and man-machine interfaces that improve the operation of our original “god-given” body. The counterpart of this medical effort is a worldwide programme to construct biomimetic materials. These function by copying tricks developed by evolution over the aeons, rather than by waiting for an idea from a bright-eyed human. Crystals of 1,4-dichlorobenzene paulslab, CC BY-NC-SA And yet, what has remained missing is an overall picture of how various well-understood physical mechanisms can combine together in detail to perform some of the precise magic required for the operation of a living organism or a living cell – which brings us back to the find that distinction between the living and the non-living. Key to this is an understanding of how ordinary physics can lead to the kind of self-organising structure seen in living tissue. It had been thought that ordinary physics favoured uniform structures, applied in both space and time. Just think of beautiful circular stars or perfectly shaped orbits of planets around the sun. But living organisms are the very antithesis of this, with different cell types that have precise function dotted around the body in just the right place. In some way nature seems to abhor uniformity. Our heartbeats and our breathing are regulated by different periodic cycles. Cells divide, on time scales that depend on temperature, type of organism and so on. On a longer time-scale there is the sleep-wake cycle dictated by the circadian rhythm, on longer scales still are menstrual cycles, and on yet longer scales, organisms are born and die. Reconstructing the bits of life A new study by Felix Keber of Technische Universität München and his colleagues, and published in Science, provides a key step to explain this discrepancy between uniformity predicted by physics and non-uniformity observed in biology. They construct and provide a precise mathematical description of a model physical system – not in itself biological, but nevertheless with common design features – with a biological energy source. It is made from materials which occur in living cells and oscillates, just like a model-cell would. Keber’s physical system consists of vesicles, small closed bags of biological membranes, which do occur in real biological systems but which can be constructed outside the cell. Proteins inside the membrane form microtubules, long thin rod-like molecules which then adsorb on to the inside of the vesicle surfaces, lying down on the surface like hair combed on someone’s head. Because the microtubules are aligned, they behave like nematic (bundles of thread-like) liquid crystals, with properties rather like those of liquid crystals in the flat screens of TVs, computers and mobile phones. Computer simulation of a carbon nanotube, which has a similar structure of biological vesicle. ghutchis, CC BY-ND The resulting “nematic vesicles” turn out to have quite dramatic properties: just as hair that is combed may leave bald spots where the combing direction is ill-defined, there are bound to be points on the vesicle surface that have defects. In Keber’s system, they found four such defects. The number of defects is a result of “topology”. Topology was originally developed in the 19th century to discuss the mathematical theory of shapes, and is best known outside mathematics for the analysis of knots. But it was appropriated by theoretical physicists in the 1970s to discuss defects in magnetism, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=superconductivity">superconductivity</a></span>, and liquid crystals. The defects can be studied by providing them with biological energy. So if the vesicle contains the the body’s energy protein (adenosine triphosphate, or ATP), then energy can be pumped into the two-dimensional liquid crystal at the vesicle surface, creating stress in the nematic pattern. This energy creates stress on the vesicle surface causing the defects to move, a bit like how stress in the earth’s crust causes earthquakes. The theoretical physicists on the team were then able to construct a simple picture of the dynamics, which concentrated on the defect motion. Revelatory oscillations So what Keber’s work has shown is that when physical systems are put to work in a biological system, close observations can provide a window in to the non-uniformity of life. And, more importantly, Keber’s work gives us a mathematical understanding of these systems, which could be further developed. Understanding how nature evolved such an exquisite system is not easy and will take a long time, but work such as this is a significant step forward. The study involved inputs from biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, and despite an enduring popular belief, the secrets of life are clearly not there to be revealed by biologists alone. There is also an interesting historical moral from this story. Liquid crystal pioneer Lehmann died in 1922. In addition to being a top-quality scientific pamphleteer, he was also a liberal intellectual with a penchant for asking big questions and creating controversies. Liquid crystals work because of the way they reflect light. Gerd Kortemeyer, CC BY If asked at the Pearly Gates how he expected his work to be remembered, Lehmann would surely have been astounded that his work on liquid crystals had created the scientific basis for a multi-billion dollar engineering industry. On the other hand, all his later writings testify to his belief that the physics of liquid crystals would establish categorically and unambiguously the missing link between the animate and inanimate spheres of scientific endeavour. Lehmann knew about vesicles, but of “active matter” and “topology” he was ignorant. In the library of the great upstairs, Otto Lehmann will be reading Keber’s study, regretting that the scientific knowledge of his day was not adequate to confirm his hypothesis, but somewhat smugly smiling to himself that his faith in his hypothesis was clearly justified. He is the coauthor (with David Dunmur) of “Soap, science and flat screen TVs, a history of liquid crystals”

                                Or not, as the case may be... Duncan Rawlinson, CC BY <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> has recently received favourable acknowledgement from Apple and significant recognition from the Bank of England, but it has just suffered another serious slump in value and some more fundamental questions are being raised about its future usefulness. At least it still has oceans of web comment to keep the ball rolling. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> generates far more noise online than its current financial footprint would suggest. It only amounts to a tiny portion of overall financial activity, currently just under $6 billion at total market capitalisation – that is the current exchange rate value of all <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s in existence. The most vociferous of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> advocates continue to talk about it as a kind of dawning social revolution, but the current state of play is a long way behind this rather utopian projection. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s value fell from $622 in July to below $387 at last check, with big investors likely to step in to shore up the value soon. So this marks a useful moment to pause and reflect on where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is and where it might be going. The currency has had an extremely volatile history but the latest dip is a rather more significant one – it does not appear to have been driven by any major regulatory warnings or a problem with a major <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchange. In a previous piece I argued that a number of economists and journalists had been far too hasty in declaring the end of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. That was partly because they were not recognising the underlying libertarian ethos of many of its users who are not likely to abandon ship any time soon. More recently a new generation of commentators have emerged who are more reasoned and informed, and make criticisms that some electronic currency advocates are also prepared to acknowledge. For example, one of the most perceptive pro-electronic currency investors Tuur Demeester noted on his Twitter feed on August 13: “pain in the cryptomarkets. Now is a day to relax, take a step back and contemplate fundamentals”. Everyday transactions One key reason for this slow down in the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> party is that the electronic currency still has real barriers to overcome before it can become widely used in everyday transactions, despite a growing number of merchants accepting it. Recently Dell and Overstock.com announced that they were accepting payments in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. Smart <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> businesses like BitPay and Coinbase have taken the lead in facilitating this process. Basically these companies offer to process transactions in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> at cheaper cost than is offered by services like PayPal, and also make the transfer back to national currency to give merchants protection from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> volatility. In addition to these positive news stories Apple has recently taken a more favourable position to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> wallet devices – having reversed its previous decision to block the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> wallet from its online App Store. The Bank of England also issued a tentatively positive report on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s potential, in which it noted that while <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was unlikely to become a serious challenge to major banks it was still a significant development that should be watched. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s at dawn… Pete Zarria, CC BY Yet despite this <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> has not taken off at the level of transactions, in fact since May it has been parked at roughly 60,00-75,000 transactions per day with no signs of increase. It is still pretty difficult to get hold of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. A user could create their own wallet and find a suitable <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> seller online before then making an exchange from their own bank account – a process that is time consuming and likely to be off-putting for many. Or users hold their <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> in online wallets on exchange sites, but these are dependent on user feedback within electronic currency communities to vouch for their reliability. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> exchanges have been likened to a “Wild West” of payment systems – a realm without legal recourse – something that was clearly borne out by the bankruptcy of Mt Gox in February. Currency or speculative asset? Another reason, of course, for the lack of everyday use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is its continuing volatility. Cyber enthusiasts and speculative investors – who tend to be overwhelmingly male – seem to be the dominant groups shaping <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> at present. One issue that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> faces is that people hold <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=virtual currency">virtual currency</a></span> for different reasons and their objectives can be at odds with one another. Speculative investors are interested in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> as a way to profit from market movements; they are short-term speculators who play the trading data. The trouble is that mid- to large-scale investors in this bracket – including hedge funds – like to see volatility as volatility means profits for some and losses for others. Those interested in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> as a potential future currency, however, are likely to be discouraged from using it, precisely because the peaks and troughs through which traders gain their profits make the currency unstable as a unit of account. This means that although <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> will stay with us as a speculative and volatile financial asset or digital commodity of some value, there remain few signs as yet of it going mainstream because of the difficulties around its ease of use and around its volatility. The first issue might still be addressed by some innovative start-ups that manage to make <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> much simpler and easier for everyday consumers to use. But the volatility problem is trickier to resolve. Blockchain Having noted these barriers to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> becoming an everyday currency, the “blockchain” still offers real promise. The blockchain is a clever piece of computer coding in which each <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> transaction that is made is linked to the previous history of transactions which led to that point. This creates the expanding chain of “blocks”. It is essentially an inventive piece of cryptography and it is what makes libertarians and computer scientists so excited because it presents a decentralised platform that effectively cuts out the middleman or indeed the need for a central bank. It may not transform everyday life in quite the way that some have claimed but it presents some interesting possibilities and platforms. A number of decentralised ventures have already been created in an attempt to explore this potential, like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ethereum">Ethereum</a></span>. The blockhain presents significant opportunities in some areas of finance and online payments. It could make remittance payments a great deal easier and cheaper; it could lower transaction costs for merchants and consumers and it enables the development of financial innovations like equity crowdfunding – in which all investors get a proportional return on what is invested in a venture. Whether these advantages of the blockchain become more widely utilised remains an open question. As Finn Brunton has said: Getting a significant new technology that is instilled with cultural values and political goals to “work” is an act of assembly of mobilising different groups, ideas, forces, and stakeholders together. The key point here is that no digital innovation is groundbreaking in itself – it requires broader communities to utilise it. And this is why for supporters, increasing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> use at the level of everyday transactions is so very important.

                                Sierra Leone's 6 million residents have been confined to their homes over the last three days as part of a nationwide lockdown aimed at stopping the spread of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> across the country. Volunteers circulated throughout towns across the disease-ravaged country to educate households, quarantine the sick and remove the dead in what Reuters calls "one of the most extreme strategies employed since the epidemic began." Officials say the lockdown will likely be extended. "There is a very strong possibility it will be extended," Stephen Gaojia, head of the Sierra Leone's Emergency Operations Centre told Reuters after meeting with President Ernest Bai Koroma. "Even though the exercise has been a huge success so far, it has not been concluded in some metropolitan cities like Freetown and Kenema." Reuters reports that 92 bodies had been recovered so far, and some 123 people had contacted authorities over concerns they may be infected with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>.

He had been on antiretroviral therapy for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> for 5 years, and his CD4 cell count was 234 cells per μL and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> RNA was 357 copies per mL. Fine needle aspiration of a lymph node suggested Hodgkin's lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry reagents were temporarily out of stock, as sometimes happens in Malawi. We started chemotherapy with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine while waiting for results of a confirmatory biopsy sample.

                                Tesla and Solar City say their vast manufacturing operations will make solar the cheapest source of electricity in the United States. At an event hosted in New York this week by Solar City, CEO Lyndon Rive and chairman <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> announced that within five to 10 years every set of solar panels that Solar City installs will come with a battery pack to help deal with the intermittency of solar power—one of the key factors limiting its use. Musk says his company Tesla Motors will supply at least some of those batteries.
