"I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to some of the worst of the disease, especially when people end up dying," said Pooley, who has been the only Briton reportedly infected. The Royal Free Hospital, the only facility in Britain with a high-level isolation unit that can host <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients, said the treatment had been "successful".

                                Nigeria on Wednesday announced that a seventh person had died from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> and another person was confirmed as having the virus. The latest death was a patient at the isolation ward in the oil city of Port Harcourt, where a doctor died on August 22 after treating a Liberian man who had brought the disease into the country. The other five deaths were in the financial capital, Lagos. Health ministry spokesman Dan Nwomeh said 18 people, including the deceased, had now been confirmed as having the virus in Nigeria -- 14 in Lagos and four in Port Harcourt, 435 kilometres (270 miles) away.

                                Vice President Joe Biden ramped up the Obama administration's rhetoric against the jihadist group Islamic State on Wednesday, declaring the U.S. will follow the militants "to the gates of hell" after they beheaded two American journalists. "We take care of those who are grieving, and when that's finished, they should know: We will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice. Because hell is where they will reside. Hell is where they will reside," Biden said in a speech in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span>. President Barack Obama has been more restrained in referring to the Islamic State after the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, released a video on Tuesday showing the execution of journalist Steven Sotloff. Last month, Islamic State published a video showing another journalist, James Foley, being beheaded. Before Biden's speech, Obama said he aims to "degrade and destroy" Islamic State. The president subsequently said he wants to get to "the point where it is a manageable problem." Biden also used his speech to praise Sotloff and Foley. "When these barbarians replicated with Steven what they did with Foley, who is from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span>, I [think they] somehow think that it's going to lessen U.S. resolve, frighten us, intimidate us. But if they think the American people will be intimidated, they don't know us very well," Biden said. "The American people are so much stronger, so much more resolved than any enemy can fully understand. As a nation, we're united and when people harm Americans, we don't retreat."

                                By Saliou Samb and Daniel Flynn CONAKRY/DAKAR (Reuters) - Guinea's government said on Wednesday that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> had spread to a previously unaffected region of the country, as U.S. Guinea, the first country to detect the hemorrhagic fever in March, had said it was containing the outbreak but authorities announced that nine new cases had been found in the southeastern prefecture of Kerouane. The area, some 750 km (470 miles) southeast of the capital Conakry, lies close to where the virus was first detected deep in Guinea's forest region. The epidemic has since spread to four other West African countries and killed more than 1,500 people.

                                Visitors to 4chan may have noticed the site’s shiny new Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy page, apparently established in the wake of a large scale celebrity photo leak. Over the past few days hackers were allegedly able to seize celebrity nude photos through an iCloud vulnerability. This leak has been popularized on sites like 4chan and Reddit as “The Fappening,” a portmanteau of “happening” and “fapping,” a slang term for masturbating. The photos first appeared on 4chan, where an anonymous hacker was publicizing them in exchange for payment in pseudonymous <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a></span> <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. Now that the FBI is investigating the leak, it’s unclear how long he, she, or they will stay anonymous. See also: For Once, The Entire Internet Isn't Blaming The Victims Of This Nude Celebrity Photo Leak Now it appears that 4chan’s leadership is taking protective action for the site. Some time on Tuesday, TorrentFreak reports, the site initiated a DMCA policy. TorrentFreak noted that it is still unclear if the DMCA policy is in direct response to the leak that's on everyone's minds.  The policy page notifies visitors of a DMCA agent for 4chan, who will now become the point of contact for any takedown requests to the site. This agent will be the sole outlet for complainants who want to report copyright violations on 4chan. Probably the reason 4chan has never had a DMCA policy before this week is because the site deletes old content at an expeditious rate to the point that 4chan threads are rarely available for much longer than a few hours. “Threads expire and are pruned by 4chan's software at a relatively high rate. Since most boards are limited to eleven or sixteen pages, content is usually available for only a few hours or days before it is removed,” the 4chan FAQ reads.  Logo via 4chan

NIAID/SGK Handout The current outbreak of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in West Africa has emerged rapidly and evolved with alarming ease. An unprecedented number of lives have been lost and WHO predictions are that the virus will infect in excess of 20,000 people before the situation can be brought under control. This is an extraordinarily challenging time for the nations affected, many of which have fragile, inadequate health infrastructures and have been unable to contain the outbreak.

                                US troops have made gains against IS.EPA/Armin Weigel With an unmistakable British accent, the now infamous Islamic State fighter thought to have killed journalist James Foley has addressed his second message to US president, Barack Obama. IS is trying to present itself as a nation but it is important to see that it is not. Its lack of legitimacy is what makes the case for intervention in Iraq so strong this time. “I’m back, Obama, because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State, because of your insistence in continuing your bombings in Amirly, Zimar and Mosul dam despite our serious warnings,” the IS militant says in his latest video. “Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.” With his talk of “our people”, the militant is pushing the idea that his group has become some kind of nation. But in the area occupied by IS, none of the institutions of a nation state are functioning. IS captured its territory at gunpoint and has alienated the local population through executions, collective expulsion and intimidation. Local authorities have been replaced with criminal foreign fighters from around the world including Europe, Africa, Chechnya and east Asia who act and behave like criminal gangs. To protect themselves from this brutal behaviour, a quarter of the Sunni population of Mosul, together with its minority Christians, Yazidis, Shiite, Shabak and others have fled Mosul in the two last months alone. It is estimated that a third of the three million people living in Mosul have deserted the city. IS targets Sunni opponents to the same extent as other religions and sects. However its militants choose to depict the situation, IS is not a nation state. It is a terrorist group that rules a large tract of land. International law defines a sovereign state as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is obvious that none of these prerequisites exist in the area under the control of IS. The same goes for legitimacy. No elections have been held and there is no evidence that the extremist group enjoys the support of any more than a tiny minority of local sympathisers. Any Western military action against IS would clearly be totally different from any former involvement in Iraq or Afghanistan. At the time of US-led invasions, both were administrated by functioning governments, even if they were brutal and authoritarian. Despite being oppressed in many ways, it was possible for the minorities of Afghanistan and Iraq to live in the homeland. But IS has now announced its plan to establish a global Caliphate, claiming all historical Islamic lands from Spain to east Asia. It presents a threat beyond the Middle East that simply wasn’t a feature of previous conflicts in the region. Whereas many regional governments opposed previous interventions, they have all unanimously agreed that IS must be removed – even Saudi Arabia and Iran are on board. The international community has a moral responsibility to unite on this issue. It must oppose this monster which is rising in their midst and remove it as quickly as possible. There is a dire need to forge an international alliance against IS which must include all parties in the region and others beyond it, even if that means working with the Syrian regime. The removal of IS will enable everyone to focus on bringing democratic change to Syria. The US has gained ground against IS with air strikes and these should be continued. There is no need to land foreign troops this time because Iraq possesses substantial federal military forces and has the Kurdish Peshmerga army. Together, they are thought to have around one million personnel. They have proven their ability to overcome IS by fighting off its fighters in the siege of Amirly city, during which they received help from the US and other Western forces. This shows that when Western governments help local forces to take on IS, it works. The militants have been badly affected and it shows. The executioner who killed Foley and now Steven Sotloff mentions Amirly in his threat to Obama. He and his group are feeling the hit, so now is the perfect time to strike again to end this disaster.

                                British companies might as well give up now. According to a new Teradata survey, UK companies are losing ground to their peers in Germany and France when it comes to "use of the new types of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> and the evolving techniques of analysis." While this may be true, it's just as likely that Teradata was polling the wrong people: C-level executives. With <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>, the CIO is often the last to know. Asking The Wrong Person There has likely always been some truth to the notion that "the CIO is the last to know," a phrase I first heard Billy Marshall articulate years ago with reference to open-source adoption. Whatever its salience historically, it's a central fact in IT today. Most of the biggest trends in computing today all escape C-level attention, at least in the adoption phase. More and more technology can be adopted without needing purchasing approval, leading IT and lines of business and the developers they employ to turn to the cloud and open source to get stuff done, usually without asking C-level permission.  Or any permission at all.  Small wonder, then, that a Frost & Sullivan report finds that 83% of IT workers and 81% of line-of-business workers admit to using non-approved, cloud-based "software-as-a-service" apps.  But the truly interesting thing is the way business operations are increasingly adopting new technologies while bypassing the IT department. As Forrester shows in its “Understanding Shifting Technology Acquisition Patterns” research note, such "lines of business" are taking on a greater role in technology purchasing, removing IT from the purchasing process in 6.3% of new technology purchases in 2013, a figure that's expected to rise to 7.2% in 2015. During the same period, the research firm expects IT-only purchases to fall from 23.7% (2013) to 21.6% (2015). This isn't to suggest that IT is doomed. After all, the more common new pattern is for the line of business to initiate a technology purchase and then include IT, a trend that Forrester expects to rise from 9.0% (2013) to 10.4% (2015) of all purchases, up from 8.0% in 2009. But no matter who initiates or completes the purchase, it's still the case that C-level executives are mostly out of the picture. This is particularly true for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> projects. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>, Big Confusion In the Teradata survey, which polled 300 C-level executives, there's a general executive malaise that their companies are falling behind in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>, oddly coupled with an insistence that they're on the right track. For example, UK executives registered lower levels of engagement with data analytics or reported less advanced use ... yet 25% still managed to describe themselves as "advanced" in new data analysis. This calls to mind Gartner's survey of IT executives: 56% of respondents struggle to get value from their data yet are either deploying or planning to imminently deploy a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> project. This suggests a serious disconnect between hype and reality of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>, and that disconnect is particularly pronounced in the C-Suite, which knows enough to demand that the company "glean actionable insights from our data!" without having the slightest clue how that will happen. Meanwhile in the real world, the IT team knows that "data scientists, data analysts and business users are more impactful to the bottom line than the C-Suite," as revealed in an InfoChimps survey.  They should know, given that it's this real world of IT and/or line of business developers that translate high-minded "actionable insights now!" nonsense into real <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> projects, often starting with an download of open source Hadoop or a NoSQL database, or enlisting the help of a SaaS service like Datameer.  Ask The Experts So the next time you want to know what's happening with a company's <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> projects, don't ask the C-level executives. They won't know.  <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> projects—done right—start small and iterate toward far-reaching success. When Brett Goldstein needed to build a predictive analytics platform for the city of Chicago, he didn't write a big check to a vendor after getting executive approval. He downloaded the technology he needed and started building it, eventually creating WindyGrid. These "WindyGrids" happen all the time today, in organizations large and small. They just don't happen with the CIO's permission, necessarily, nor do they require CEO approbation.  If you want to know what's really happening with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> in your enterprise, in other words, ask your developers. Or IT. Or anyone but the C-level executive. Image courtesy of Shutterstock

                                Total Word energy sector emissions (annual percentage change due to fossil fuel consumption) plotted as a function of economic activity ( annual percentage change in GDP). Since 1982, global energy sector emissions have been growing at average rate of 1.9 percent while GDP has been increasing at close to 3.5 percent. The emission plot shows that the dominant control of emissions growth is economic activity, with the recessions of 1982 and 2009, the only years with absolute reductions in emissions. The black line shows the best linear fit to the data defines the emission lock. Figure by Mike Sandiford, data from BP's 2014 Statistical Review of World Energy and IMF's World Economic Outlook [1]. A key issue in the climate debate relates to the role of natural gas as a potential climate bridge. Judging by much of the narrative surrounding the US <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> revolution, you might guess that natural gas was a sure-fire bet. Certainly, enfant terrible of the environmental movement, Bjorn Lomborg, thinks so. In a recent contribution published in the Australian, Lomborg argued the case that ‘Gas is greenest in the short term’, citing US experience in the wake of the shale-gas revolution to make the case. To do so, Lomborg uses a logic for which I may have been at least partly to blame. But, for the reasons outlined below, I don’t think the data support the case. First, the background … In the northern summer of 2013, I shared the stage with Lomborg at a joint session at the International Student Energy Summit titled “A Crossroad to a Sustainable Future, Will We Ever Overcome Our Carbon Addiction?” in Trondheim, Norway. No doubt everyone in the packed auditorium was there to see Lomborg. He didn’t disappoint, relishing the opportunity to provoke and cajole the young and somewhat hostile audience in his own inimitable way. I was very much the filler, and though I doubt anyone in the audience knew of me, I nevertheless enjoyed the occasion immensely. My talk covered a theme I subsequently posted on the Conversation, in a piece titled the Black Decade. My talk focussed on a figure, like the one above, that shows how global emission growth scales with economic activity. I made the point, as many have before, that the phenomenal scale of our use of fossil fuels provides an ‘emission lock’ - economic growth has come inevitably at the cost of growth in emissions. In recent history, significant reduction in the rate of emissions growth has only been achieved through severe global recession, most notably in the years of 1982 and 2009. In his recent piece, Lomborg picked up on this logic, adding that on longer timescales wars have provided another effective way to reduce the rate of emissions growth. In his recent piece in the Australian, Lomborg makes a point that I wholeheartedly agree with. Neither recession nor war are particularly palatable mechanisms for dealing with the climate challenge. In my 2013 talk in Norway, I stressed that the challenge is to move off the emissions lock, to a part of that diagram we have never been in before. To achieve 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 we need reduce emissions at an average annual rate of about 4 percent each year until 2050. In other words, we need on average to be on the green line at the very bottom of the figure. To do so without economic calamity requires a dramatic de-carbonsation of the economy, so that we stick to the right hand side of the diagram characterised by economic growth. The challenge is to move off the ‘emission lock’ towards the bottom right (or, at worst, the bottom centre), rather than slide down the lock to the bottom left. As highlighted in my piece the Black Decade, the problem is that rather than moving towards that goal, the world is moving away from it. Over the last five years have the global economy emission intensity has increased. Total World emission plot, highlighting the years 2009, through 2013, illustrating they all lie above the best fit line (in black) for the full data array from 1982 through 2013 (small red dots). Figure by Mike Sandiford, data from BP's 2014 Statistical Review of World Energy and IMF's World Economic Outlook [1]. This point is best illustrated with a variant on the emission plots above that shows the residuals obtained by subtracting the economic variability. The residual plot, as shown below, shows clearly that over the last 5 years the emissions intensity of the global economy has increased. In fact it has been operating at about 0.7 percent higher than expectation. In real terms that amounts to an extra 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 added to the atmosphere over the five years, over and above the additional 2.5 billion tonnes of extra CO2 expected for the ‘business-as-usual’ annual GDP growth of about 3 percent for the period. Total World residual emission plot. As for the figure above, but showing the residuals obtained by subtracting the best fit line that accounts for the dominant source of variability in emissions attributable to variations in economic activity. The residuals show that the emission intensity the five year period 2009 through 2013 averaged about 0.7 percent above expectation. Figure by Mike Sandiford, data from BP's 2014 Statistical Review of World Energy and IMF's World Economic Outlook [1]. So much for decarbonisation… So what has it all got to do with the US shale-gas revolution? In his recent piece, Lomborg suggests that gas is the best short-term hope of breaking the emission lock. To quote, ‘Look[ing] at the dramatic reduction in US emissions since 2008 … shows that there is one other solution to CO2 apart from wars and recessions: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>, a new technology to get gas out of the ground cheaper and more plentifully.’ The key is the explicit assertion that Lomborg makes is that there has a ‘dramatic reduction in US emissions since 2008’. The implicit assertion is that, if there has, that it is more than we would expect from the economic factors. In the spirit of the Skeptical Environmentalist these assertions are worth testing. To do so, we need to factor out the dominant economic signal, which is not inconsiderable. That is well illustrated by 2009 - the deepest recession in the US in over 30 years. In 2009, US emissions declined by about 6.5 percent in that year, on the back of a 2 percent reduction in GDP . That is only marginally greater than we would expect, even if there were no other factors at play apart from the recession. The short answer to the question of whether the US shale-gas revolution has substantially impacted the emissions intensity of the US economy, is that it hasn’t. In fact the impact has been effectively “squat all”, at least according to BP’s data [1] as shown in both the raw and residual data in the figures below. Both 2011 and 2012 show significantly negative residuals reflecting to a reduction in emission intensity. But that was countered in years 2010 and 2013, both with significant positive residual emissions. The net result is that the US emissions intensity residuals over the five year period is marginal (-0.2 percent residual), at least according to BP’s data. While there has been a reduction in rate of growth in emissions over the period (-1.2 percent absolute), it can be entirely accounted for by the lower US economic activity (average GDP growth of only 1.2 percent). US emission data plotted as function of GDP in annual percentage change terms. The black line shows the best fit for the period 1982-2013 (red dots). The red lines intersect at the average, and span the ranges, for the period 2009 through 2013. The red solid circles for the years 2014 and 2015 are based on estimates from the IMF and World Bank respectively [see note 2]. Figure by Mike Sandiford, data from BP's 2014 Statistical Review of World Energy and IMF's World Economic Outlook [1]. US residual emission plot. Despite significant inter-annual volatility for the years 2009 though 2013, the residual anomaly given by the intersection of the red lines is near zero. The projections for the years 2014 and 2015, suggest the emission intensity anomaly for the period 2009+ will become positive, reflecting an overall increase in the emission intensity of the economy, despite the much vaunted shale-gas revolution. The notes below [2] some of some of the causes for projected changes in US emissions. Figure by Mike Sandiford, data from BP's 2014 Statistical Review of World Energy and IMF's World Economic Outlook [1]. Going by the projections of the US Energy Information Agency - or EIA - and the World Bank, the next few years are not looking any better for US emissions. The EIA predicts emissions will rise again in 2014 by 2.5 percent, before falling marginally in 2015 [2]. On the basis of World Bank assessments of GDP growth, the six-year average 2009 though 2015 is set to rise above trend intensity, all in spite the much vaunted <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> revolution. In reality, the emission reductions achieved by the US have resulted from sliding down the emissions lock, rather than moving off it. So much for the for the role of gas as a climate bridge. While it might seem unrelentingly gloomy in terms of the climate implications, the concern in my talk at Norway was not entirely pessimistic. I was at pains to show that one country in particular had seemingly broken free of its emission lock, and it had nothing to do with gas. The country in question was Australia. One year further on, with an updated dataset courtesy of the latest release of BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy, the evidence is now even more clear. Australian emission data plotted as function of GDP in annual percentage change terms [1]. The black line is the best fit for the period 1982-2013. The red lines intersect at the averages and span the ranges for the period 2009 through 2013. Figure by Mike Sandiford, data from BP's 2014 Statistical Review of World Energy and IMF's World Economic Outlook [1]. Australian residual emission plot. For the years 2009 though 2013 the residual anomaly (shown by the intersection of the red lines) is negative, and approaches the long term climate ambition of -4 percent as shown by the green line. Figure by Mike Sandiford, data from BP's 2014 Statistical Review of World Energy and IMF's World Economic Outlook [1]. For four out of the last five years Australia’s energy sector emissions growth has been negative. In contrast with the US, the residual emission anomaly for the 5-year period is signficantly below trend at -3.4 percent (absolute -2.4 percent), despite the factor of two higher GDP growth (average 2.5 percent) Australia’s emission intensity is set to start rising again, potentially at alarming rates, as key emission reductions policies are unwound by the current government. That places the US, Australia and the whole world literally between a rock and a hard place. And every good geologist knows that gas is very much the stuff of soft rocks. Notes: [1] the data used in this analysis reports emissions in the energy sector covering all fossil fuels (transport, stationary energy, etc …) based on consumption data as reported in BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy (release date June, 2014). The GDP data are from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (release date April 2014). [2] The US EIA estimates “that carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels increased by 2.4% in 2013 from the previous year. Emissions are forecast to rise by 1.4% in 2014, and then to decline by 0.6% in 2015. The increase in total emissions in 2013 and 2014 reflects increases in emissions from coal of 4.2% and 2.7%, respectively. The price of natural gas to electric power generators rose on average by $0.91/MMBtu in 2013 and is projected to rise by $0.95/MMBtu in 2014, contributing to an increase coal use. Coal emissions are projected to decline by 2.6% in 2015 .” see (release date August 12, 2014). The World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects (GEP) predicts US GDP growth of 2.1% and 3.0% for years 2014 and 2015,respectively (release date June 2014). Note that the EIA “projects total coal consumption growth of 2.5% to 949 MMst in 2014 because of higher electricity demand and power sector natural gas prices 22% above their 2013 level. Total coal consumption is projected to fall by 2.7% in 2015, as retirements of coal power plants rise in response to the implementation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, electricity sales growth slows to 0.4%, and natural gas prices fall relative to coal prices.” (Release Date: August 12, 2014).

                                You've been found.johanl, CC BY The world’s most popular gay social networking app, Grindr, is having a tough time. William Saponaro Jr is suing its developers for negligence, after he was arrested for sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child. Sapnaro claims a 13-year-old boy that he and another man had sex with had been on Grindr – which has a minimum age requirement of 18 – and that the liaison had been arranged via the app. Meanwhile, Thomas Miguel Guerra, an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-positive man living in southern California, has been publicly outed as planning to infect his sexual partners with the virus. We should perhaps not be surprised that these two stories have been so newsworthy. Almost 60 years after the Wolfenden Report was published, which said that “homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence”, gay men’s supposed links with disease and paedophilia still figure in the cultural imagination on both sides of the Atlantic. Then, in late August, it was revealed that without even logging on to the app, internet users could access the exact location of other users of Grindr. While <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission and child sexual abuse are extremely serious issues, the potential impact of this story, and the number of men that it could affect, makes it worthy of further consideration. This “flaw” in the software allows anyone to pinpoint with alarming precision – about 100 feet – another user’s exact location. Initially Grindr insisted that this isn’t a “flaw” and responded to criticisms by suggesting that users who are uncomfortable with the geo-locative capacity of the app, can simply turn it off. But after a backlash from users, on September 1, it was reported that Grindr has turned off the “distance” option. (An official announcement could not be located and accessing the app in the UK still shows how far away some users are.) Even if the feature is eventually turned off, Grindr’s initial response underscores their lack of respect for users' political and social backgrounds. Grindr’s selling point Grindr became the killer app in gay social media not because of its design or for its communication utility, but because of its geo-locative capacities. Anyone who uses Grindr knows their distance is visible to other users (unless they turn that function off). What few of us knew was that our exact location was being given out. Having spent the past ten years researching gay men’s use of digital and social media, I can testify to this lack of awareness. Social media’s response to Grindr’s “flaw” and users' prior lack of awareness of it points toward concerns that pervade not only gay male digital culture, but digital and social media more generally. Grindr offers a chocolate box of hotties and tells users how close you are to the candy. In doing so, it reinserts geography into gay men’s cruising culture, and resurrects John Rechy’s sexual outlaw for the digital age. Its popularity highlights our willing ignorance of the technologies that we use in our daily lives. I have interviewed men who have called Grindr “addictive”, who say they cannot resist pulling their phones out and checking the local area, even when on a date. Men who have marvelled at the sheer scale of their local gay “community”, even men who have used it to quiz others about whether a given street is a gay-friendly place to live. Easy candy While I doubt the app is actually addictive in the clinical sense, it is certainly alluring. Grindr offers gay men something they have never had before – the ability to “see” one another as they go about their daily lives. Small wonder then that users don’t stop to check the small print of the app’s terms and conditions. When it comes to matters of intimacy, it surely isn’t surprising that many of us didn’t think about the relationship between this sexy little app and, for example, the images of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> attacks reported in the pages of the newspaper we read on the way to work. We, as gay men, have largely been ignorant of Grindr’s “back-end” because we have had little interest in it. It has been enough that it works – quickly, effectively and for free. (Of course, some do care. I know many gay men who would never dream of using Grindr for these specific reasons.) Which brings me on to the second key issue that this glitch illustrates: Grindr’s unwavering and dangerous investment in a culture of Homonormativity. Lisa Duggan of New York University coined the term “homonormative” in 2002. She defines the term as follows: Homonormative means to identify a politics that does not contest dominant heteronormative assumptions and institutions, but upholds and sustains them, while promising the possibility of a demobilised gay constituency and a privatised, depoliticised gay culture anchored in domesticity and consumption. Aligning homonormativity with a broader Anglo-American project of neoliberalism, Duggan argues that the political potential of the 1970s LGBT movement, which challenged gender inequality, the institution of marriage, income disparities, racism and misogyny became marginalised by the 1990s, as white, middle-class gay men became increasingly powerful within a system that was reluctantly accepting them. Such assimilation into the “mainstream” engendered a shift away from radical politics to designer lifestyles … for those who could afford to be good gay consumers. That Grindr initially did not see this location “glitch” as a problem underscores the homonormative politics of the application, and its developers. You have to be invested in a politics of the homonormative in order to both support gay men’s endeavours to connect and simultaneously fail to recognise the implications of rendering such connections visible to anyone who cares to look. Such a belief can only come from those who have evacuated themselves from the ongoing daily struggle of queer people around the world. Grindr’s lack of empathy in their initial response underscores this and suggests that it is the user, as opposed to the service, that is “failing”. The issue, for Grindr, is not one of being outed online, but of remaining in the closet offline. Accordingly, if anyone is at fault here, it is the user, for not living up to their digital persona. Missing the context The fact that Grindr is available in countries where men are routinely beaten, tortured, maimed, flogged, imprisoned, raped and murdered for being homosexual is a shining example of Duggan’s homonormative model at work. I have spoken with wealthy Arab men and women who come to the UK each summer “to be gay”. They talk of Grindr as if it was their saviour, allowing them to connect with one another when back at home. I am in no doubt that, within such contexts, an app like Grindr does feel like salvation. But Grindr’s unwillingness to advertise its intense geo-locative capacities suggests that the developers have little to no interest in the political or social contexts of their users. Or, to be more precise, they are unwilling to consider any context of queer life other than the privileged, white, middle-class Anglo-American one that they inhabit. In 2010, I researched several cases where mobile phones and personal computers – once lifelines for their owners – had been turned against them and used as both evidence and a method of locating other men. But this time it is different. This time, the service is gay-owned designed explicitly for gay men. In its attempt to make their app as addictive as possible they guys over at Grindr have failed to acknowledge the vulnerability of queer people across the world. If there was ever a better example of a “privatised, depoliticised gay culture” then I don’t know what it is.

                                The news: Health authorities admitted Tuesday that the West African <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus epidemic is accelerating quickly and may soon outpace the ability of medical teams to contain it. Meanwhile, the grim situation is being made worse by a massive strike among Liberian health care workers, who have accumulated large amounts of unpaid wages while suffering from overwork and the constant risk of exposure. "It's spiraling out of control. The situation is bad, and it looks like it's going to get worse quickly," Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden told NBC News. "There is still a window of opportunity to tamp it down but that window is closing, and we need to act now. ... This is different than every other <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> situation we've ever had.

After all, most of his work has involved pointing out all of the things <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> enthusiasts don’t want to hear. On the one hand, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> “believers” want a currency that is essentially free of government and corporate oversight. On the other hand, they want the establishment to believe in the fundamental benefits of it as a currency. Professor Yermack, who once researched the economic impact of the fashion decisions of US First Lady Michelle Obama, has recently turned his hand to detailing some of the bizarre and humorous characteristics of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. Like the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> ATM installed in Melbourne which offered to sell 1 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> for A$585 and buy 1 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> for A$523. Not only was the spread 10.5% but the current market rate for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was $511 and so essentially the ATM company would be losing money on its transactions. Professor Yermack argues <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> should not be considered money, for a number of reasons. These include <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s inability to act as a medium of exchange or a store of value or act as a unit of account. In looking at the way <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is used (or not) as a medium of exchange, he points out the number of daily transactions of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s has fundamentally not changed in the past year. It has essentially stayed at around 60,000 transactions, which illustrates <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> has experienced almost no growth in popularity, despite the assertion that increasing numbers of merchants are willing to accept it. For many store owners, accepting <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was about marketing to a particular demographic that is young, tech savvy and relatively well off. As a means of payment, the fact that you have to calculate prices of purchases with amounts such as 0.00301 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> or “3.01 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> times 10 to the minus 2” effectively means it is never likely to become a unit of account. Professor Yermack’s research on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> volatility found it displayed an average 10% price change per day with an overall volatility of 142% over the course of a year. This compared to Gold’s price fluctuation of 22% in 2013. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s’ price difference on a range of different exchanges also posed a problem for people trying to actually value <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> at any given point in time. This was something you would never see with US dollars, for example, and contravenes basic economic principles of currency. Another characteristic of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s price during the year was that it was in no way related to the price of any other currency. Significant events in the global economy that impacted currencies like the US and Australian dollar had no effect on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s value is derived from its main role, which is as a curiosity and as a means of investment speculation. As a final taunt to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> faithful, Professor Yermack suggests the entire <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> mining effort could be subverted by a person or government - such as Vladimir Putin - taking control of the peer-to-peer network that essentially validates every transaction. In all likelihood this would be possible, but more research is required to convince the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> community of the validity of the argument. Regardless of what the future holds for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, the interest in it has challenged fundamental views of economics, law and finance. Professor Yermack plans to cash this particular <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> characteristic in and is running a course at NYU on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> starting this year. Hopefully something he will share with a wider audience again some day. David Glance owns 3 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s.

The patent appears to cover a method of landing a rocket on a floating platform at sea. In their papers, SpaceX says that "by 2009, the earliest possibly priority date listed on the face of the patent, the basic concepts of 'rocket science' were well known and widely understood. The "rocket science" claimed in the '321 patent was, at best, 'old hat[.]'" Blue Origin has approximately three months to file a preliminary response to the challenge.

                                Data At Work profiles data scientists working at the cutting edge of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>. Suppose data scientists could track how people move through cities and towns as easily as e-commerce sites track them online? Don't answer that. It's already happening—thanks, at least in part, to a startup called StreetLight Data. StreetLight founder and CEO Laura Schewel was working on a doctorate in energy engineering at UC Berkeley when she had the “ah-ha” idea of using data from cell towers, traffic-data aggregators and GPS satellites to track people's movement patterns in cities and states across the country. Streetlight Data founder and CEO Laura Schewel Initially, Schewel figured the information might help traffic engineers plan new highways and parking. But the data her system aggregates turns out to be useful for much, much more. How To Track Without Tracking Like it or not, it's ridiculously easy to see how people behave online. Cookies and more sophisticated techniques let advertisers track individuals across websites, in part because the online environment is controlled (in just about every sense of the term). This type of tracking, and the related task of gathering insights into peoples' behavior, is much more complicated in real life.  The basic problem is one of putting together all the pieces of a massive puzzle that don't exactly fit. How do you get and make sense of the data generated by ordinary people in order to say with any degree of certainty—in generalized and anonymous but still analytically useful ways—where they shop, which highways they take or even whether they're more likely to take the train on Fridays when the Giants are playing and traffic is lousy in San Francisco? See also: Why Data Scientists Get Paid So Much For StreetLight, it all starts with the cellphone. It probably won't surprise you to know that major carriers collect detailed location data as your phone registers with different cellular broadcast towers (thus providing a detailed record of your movements). But you might not have known that carriers sell access to that data in a format that basically provides a movement record for large chunks of the population. It's all anonymized: The data consists of map plot coordinates and the ID numbers that identify particular phones, with the latter run through a one-way hashing function designed to yield unique numbers that can't be matched to the original IDs.  StreetLight's proprietary pattern-recognition algorithms can infer the "favorite" places of the people covered in the carrier geodata, such as their home and work neighborhoods. Then StreetLight cross references this info with census and other demographic information such as household income, educational status and race. [Corrected: see below] What it ends up with are richly detailed databases that can be used, say, to generate the average profile of someone who might be shopping at Whole Foods at 5pm, dropping a child off at school on a Monday morning, or commuting from San Francisco to the East Bay to work.   Put that way StreetLight sounds sounds sort of creepy—and maybe it is. Schewel and her team, of course, stress that safeguards such as those one-way hashes make it impossible to tie aggregated data about groups back to individual users. “There is no way for us to actually map anything back to individuals. All that data is stripped out long before we get it,” Schewel told me. At the same time, de-anonymizing such information tends to become easier over time, in part because individuals are generating increasing quantities of data about themselves that can serve as a cross-reference to pinpoint actual identities. Whether or not such privacy concerns have merit, this type of data can provide valuable information in a variety of situations. Think companies deciding whether and where to expand; city and transit planners projecting the need for new zoning, transit or roadways; and perhaps developing nations planning new infrastructure and even entire cities. Turning Data Into Information The process by which StreetLight maps together these very different types of data into a coherent dataset turns out to be fairly straightforward. Every month, Schewel’s team receives a messy glob of about 400GB worth of geospatial data from mobile carriers and other data providers. That doesn't sound like much—even given that the load is expected to reach 800GB a month next year—considering that StreetLight's movement patterns cover much of the continental U.S. (The company occasionally also scrapes up Canadian data by accident, and has to discard it.) But geospatial data is fairly lean and has a small footprint, Schewel says. The data is added to StreetLight's existing multi-terabyte data store. StreetLight then pushes the data through a custom extract, transform and load process run through Talend, a popular <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> integration tool. This trims out unnecessary information and reformats different types of data into a uniform schema. Along the way, this process matches up different types of data—cellular-tower location, traffic reports, census patterns, other data sources—at different geographic scales ranging from census block to town or city to region, and along expressways or other transit corridors. All that data gets referenced to particular geospatial locations and, in many cases, to specific time periods as well ("all the time," "weekdays," "rush hour," etc.). What StreetLight Knows About Us All that work links together disparate types of data in a meaningful way, making it possible to get a good sense of where people who fit a particular demographic profile spend their time—and when. Say, for instance, you wanted to know more about people who shop at the Stanford Mall. The StreetLight database might tell you that people over 50 with graduate degrees who live in high-end neighborhoods shop there all the time; families with children from middle-class and high-end neighborhoods shop there on weekends (especially in August and December); and people without college degrees only visit the mall on Monday evenings in the spring. Now that's data transparency. StreetLight can, for instance, help out a retail chain that's thinking about opening a new store with better information about its prospective customers. For instance, whether the average shopper in a proposed mall location earns closer to $50,000 or $100,000, has one child or three, or is a 50-year-old females or a 21-year-old male. As you can imagine, such data is incredibly valuable, and not just to companies. As Schewel explained it to me: We can actually show what might happen if, say, a new freeway off-ramp would be built or a road is changed or even if a big snowstorm hits. We can do this by finding days in the past when an event creating similar conditions occurred. It’s much better than running simulations because it's real behavior. For a decent degree of confidence, StreetLight needs a sample size equal to at least 1% of the population of any location. Schewel prefers 5% to 6% for better signal fidelity, though. X-Raying The Average Shopper Already, StreetLight is proving its worth in some unexpected ways. In 2013, the Oakland Business Development Corporation (OBDC) wanted to increase economic activity in downtown neighborhoods where hundreds of commercial properties lay vacant. Oakland locals, too, were spending up to three-quarters of their retail dollars elsewhere, in part for lack of options. Foodies in the East Bay knew the downtown Oakland dining scene was on fire; OBDC, a nonprofit urban-development agency and business lending organization, tried to capitalize on the boom by courting retailers and developers. But it struck out when its prospects looked at demographic data on nearby neighborhoods, many of which are low-income areas, and backed away. OBDC turned to StreetLight for a clearer picture of downtown Oakland's commercial prospects. Its data revealed that the area regularly draws a healthy mix of wealthy, middle-class and lower income people. OBDC used those findings to convince skeptical store owners to consider locating downtown. But the organization, which also makes loans to retailers, put the data to broader use—primarily to confirm that the area's shopping demographics could support a variety of store types. "That data helped us fill dozens of vacant storefronts over the next year," says Jacob Singer, OBDC's president and CEO. Singer is now considering purchasing StreetLight data as part of retail and urban planning efforts around an upcoming bus-based rapid-transit project slated for downtown Oakland in the next few years. "There really are no comparable alternatives that provide data this detailed and accurate for urban planning and project assessment," he says. Reading The StreetLight X-Ray VeggieGrill, a rapidly growing vegetarian fast-food chain, signed up with StreetLight to learn where people who most closely matched the vegetarian demographic tended to shop and spend their time. Other retailers are using StreetLight data in reverse. Men's Wearhouse, for instance, uses StreetLight not just to spot new store locations, but to identify underperforming stores based on traffic patterns and shopper demographics. StreetLight's data often reveals unexpected patterns—or their absence. Sometimes it shows big differences in the types of shoppers that frequent two adjacent shopping centers, or surprising discrepancies between stores and their neighborhoods. “We can also tell a store chain that the wealthy people who live around a location rarely go to that store,” says Schewel. "For some customers, we have seen surprising dead zones where you would think a ton of people would shop but in fact few venture in." Beyond Shopping Schewel has big plans beyond helping merchants optimize their store locations. Like, for instance, improving public planning in developing countries with detailed data. “Many of these countries don’t have a census and don’t really know how people are moving around, so our information would be the first real data," she says. And since countries that never had widespread land lines often have denser cellphone networks than the U.S., Schewel thinks StreetLight could provide even more detailed user data. Ultimately, StreetLight’s data could also help answer more difficult questions about whole-day transport patterns. These patterns reflect complex human decisions that result in behaviors and traffic patterns that are hard to analyze in isolation. As Schewel told me: We can capture the entire traveling day of citizens. Rather than just seeing what happens when someone is going from home to work, we can see that people have not taken public transit because they have to pick up their child from school or that they are more likely to go to a supermarket to buy groceries on Friday night. This type of detail lets everyone that needs to know how people move see cause-and-effect far better than before. Correction, 11:19pm PT: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the information StreetLight purchases from carriers. It acquires only geolocation data from carriers, not anonymized demographic and user information.

                                So this is how it ends: With volcanoes erupting in Iceland and Papua New Guinea this summer, Murphy's Law suggests it's only a matter of time before the U.S. gets its due. And according to the American Geophysical Union, we may have a candidate: The Yellowstone "supervolcano," a slumbering giant that most recently erupted from beneath Yellowstone National Park 640,000 years ago.

But perhaps inspired by the musings of amateur geologists – who see recent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helium">helium</a></span> emissions and odd bison migrations as ominous signs – the Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems journal has published a study projecting the fallout from such an event. Obviously, it's bad news. Read More

                                This progression is known as Moore’s law. For more than 100 years, the processing power of computers had doubled every 18 months. Computers and the information technology that they enable are absorbing other fields. So we are seeing exponential advances in sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, 3D printing, and so on.

                                The news: In a major victory for environmentalists, California may soon become the first state to officially ban all plastic bags. The state legislature has narrowly approved a measure to remove all lightweight, single-use plastic bags from grocery, convenience and liquor stores by 2016, grandfathering in the more than 100 cities and counties that have already taken action to ban the bags on their own, according to the Sacramento Bee.  Source: Getty ImagesFierce opposition from paper and plastic bag industry lobbyists and national manufacturing companies now makes signing the bill a tough choice for Gov. Jerry Brown, a moderate Democrat with a long commitment to environmental issues but a mixed record on issues like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>.

Prompted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, China has prioritised the control of cross-border transmission of infectious diseases and other health-related risks. In governance, China has joined UN and related international bodies and has begun to contribute to pooled multilateral funds.

                                The news: World Health Organization doctors warned Thursday that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus epidemic in West Africa could eventually grow to as many as 20,000 cases, over six times the currently understood scale. The WHO also said a new containment plan estimates that the number of cases in the worst-hit areas may be two to three times as high as officially recognized. New figures indicated 1,552 of 3,069 confirmed cases have resulted in death in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria, while at least 40% of all cases appeared in just the past three weeks. The epidemic in West Africa has shown no signs of slowing down, and it may soon expand in an unprecedented way that threatens to devastate local populations and overwhelm the region's health authorities.

                                IN 2012 China’s main planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, declared that the country would produce 60 billion-100 billion cubic metres of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> a year in 2020. It needed those forecasts to be accurate.They weren’t. Wu Xinxiong, the director of China’s National Energy Administration, recently predicted that only 30 billion cubic metres a year will come on stream by 2020. That would barely meet 1% of China’s energy needs now, let alone in 2020.This is profoundly disappointing. With more than 30 trillion cubic metres of recoverable <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span>, China has the largest reserves in the world, almost 70% more than in America, home of the shale-gas revolution. It is also a setback to the country’s efforts to reduce pollution. Dirty coal now makes up about 70% of energy consumption and, despite fast growth in renewable energy, gas is the only cleanish energy source that could displace enough coal to rein in carbon emissions quickly.China has found that replicating America’s shale strategy—even with American help—is harder than it expected. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fracking">Fracking</a></span> works by injecting millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale and releasing gas. American shale seams are mostly found in easily accessible areas at quite shallow depths, and formed of rock that is easy to fracture. China’s are mostly deeper,...

Millions of gallons of a cocktail of water, sand and chemicals are injected into the horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale, releasing the gas—and causing violent protests in Europe and parts of America.Geothermal energy, by contrast, has yet to stir much controversy. Most geothermal plants are located where water has seeped down into the Earth’s crust, been heated and forced back up through permeable rock. Drill a well to between 3,000 and 12,000 feet, and the searing water and steam can be released to drive generators.Geothermal is a minnow among power sources. America has the world’s highest installed capacity of geothermal generating plants—3.4 gigawatts’ worth at last count (see first chart)—but they generate only 0.4% of its electricity (see second chart). New “enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS), however, look set to...

Time 21:01:21 I used to be such a sweet sweet thing, 'til they got a hold of me, I opened doors for little old ladies, I helped the blind to see, I got no friends 'cause they read the papers, they can't be seen, With me, and I'm feelin' real shot down, And I'm, uh, feelin' mean, No more, Mr. Nice Guy, No more, Mr. Clean, No more, Mr. Nice Guy, They say He's sick, he's obscene". My dog bit me on the leg today, my cat clawed my eyes, Ma's been thrown out of the social circle, and Dad has to hide, I went to church, incognito, when everybody rose, The reverend Smithy, he recognized me, And punched me in the nose, he said, (chorus) He said "You're sick, you're obscene".  Alice Cooper, "No More Mr. Nice Guy"
