                                For months Bill Ackman has been working with pharmaceutical company Valeant to acquire its peer, Allergan. But with the news that Allergan might acquire another pharmaceutical company, Ackman's plans may be ruined — and he threatened to sue Allergan over that in a strongly worded letter. "We have read published reports that you are negotiating a substantial highly leveraged acquisition that would not require shareholder approval in an attempt to preclude a transaction with Valeant Pharmaceuticals," said the letter, published by ValueWalk. "This action would directly contradict your repeated published statements... If you take such action we will immediately bring litigation against you (and any counter-party that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span> and abets you) for breach of fiduciary duty. " Together, Allergan and this new company in the game, Salix, are too expensive for Valeant and Ackman to buy. So if the two companies get together that's game over for Ackman and Valeant's over $45 billion deal. That is why Ackman is threatening to take Allergan to Court. He's saying that if Allergan acquires Salix, it is violating its promise to allow shareholders to vote on the deal he wants to do with Valeant. That vote would take place on December 18th. Allergan released a statement countering Ackman's letter that said — in so many words — we've got this, but thanks for the threats. “While we do not comment on rumors or speculation," said Allergan's statement. "we do note that the Allergan Board continues to conclude that Valeant’s bid for Allergan is grossly inadequate and substantially undervalues Allergan. The Allergan Board is well aware of its fiduciary obligations and, in that context, is focused on enhancing value for all stockholders, unlike Mr. Ackman who is financially incentivized to deliver Allergan to Valeant at the lowest possible price.” Allergan has put hurdle after hurdle up before Ackman and Valeant since the allies announced that they intended to purchase Allergan this spring.  Earlier this year it sued them for insider trading over the way the deal went down.  "This case is about the improper and illicit insider-trading scheme hatched in secret by a billionaire hedge fund investor on the one hand, and a public-company serial acquirer on the other hand," read Allergan's complaint. "... The method the Defendants chose was to operate in secret, flouting key provisions of the federal securities laws designed to protect investors from precisely this type of predatory conduct." The SEC then launched its own investigation into the matter. The crux of all of this is  a debate as to whether Valeant — not Allergan — is a viable company or not. Valeant bills itself as an innovative company that has learned how to grow organically by acquiring smash hit products and cutting research and development costs. Allergan perfectly fits that bill, as it is the maker of Botox and Lattice. But there is a darker side to that story. Investors like short-seller Jim Chanos think Valeant is an accounting roll up, a company that needs to acquire other companies in order to appear healthy and hide losses in its balance sheet. That could be why, from the beginning, Ackman and Valeant have stressed the importance of getting this deal done ASAP. Meanwhile, Allergan has — for all intents and purposes — stalled. Back in July Ackman's fund did a presentation on the deal and a listener asked Ackman a simple question. Why not wait to do the deal and let the Bausch & Lomb acquisition annualize to show that it is growing organically? Valeant had, after all, said that it was confident that Bausch & Lomb would continue "to deliver organic growth of >10%... for the remainder of 2014." Ackman replied that it wouldn't be fair for shareholders to let a deal like the one he and Valeant had put on the table pass them by.  If Allergan acquires Salix, though, shareholders will have no problem laughing Valeant and Ackman off.  And Valeant will have to find some other super stars to add to its product line. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: We've just witnessed the first masterpiece of the modern hedge fund era Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                There was skepticism around Butterfly Labs from the beginning. Like most <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin">bitcoin</a></span> companies, the Missouri-based startup sprang up out of nowhere. In late 2011, there were rumors of a leap in the technology for mining <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin">bitcoin</a></span>. This technological leap had the potential to create massive profits for miners, as well as massive profits for those selling the new equipment to miners. It was the old selling-pickaxes-during-the-Gold-Rush strategy. Except Butterfly Labs added a twist. They didn't sell pickaxes. They sold preorders for pickaxes. <span class='elision'>Continue reading…</span>

                                Not too long ago, when most people heard the word “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s,” they thought of unmanned military aircraft engaged in highly controversial clandestine operations. But when Jeff Bezos announced that Amazon was testing the idea of delivering packages via <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, he made <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s with popular commercial application suddenly seem like a viable proposition.  We estimate that 12% of an estimated $98 billion in cumulative global spending on aerial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s over the next decade will be for commercial purposes. While <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are unlikely to become a part of our daily lives in the immediate future,  they will soon begin taking on much larger roles for businesses and some individual consumers, from delivering groceries and e-commerce orders to revolutionizing private security, to changing the way farmers manage their crops — perhaps even aerial advertising.  In a new report from BI Intelligence, we size the commercial and military <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> market to estimate how big the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry could become, and which industries are most likely to see <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s become part of their business model in the next few years.

And we assess how <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> development will proceed in light of stiff safety and privacy concerns and regulatory hurdles.  Access The Full Report By Signing Up For A Free Trial Today>> Here are some of the issues and opportunities that will impact how the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> industry develops:  American regulators plan to phase in commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> flights beginning in 2015, starting with limited flights of small <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s weighing 55 pounds or less. Retail and e-commerce — along with the related logistics and shipping industries — arguably have the most at stake in the wide deployment of civilian and commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span> might be the missing link in the shipping chain that allows for nearly immediate e-commerce deliveries. But there are few industries that couldn't potentially be touched by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, especially on the enterprise side. Currently, military applications dominate the global UAV market, but commercial applications will quickly ramp up over the next 10 years, particularly after 2020.  Privacy and safety concerns still pose the risk of chilling commercial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> flights in many markets, but if UAVs are rolled out gradually we believe the benefits of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>-powered commercial applications, such as environmental monitoring and shipping, will ultimately win public opinion over.

                                By Tom Miles GENEVA (Reuters) - Global goods trade will grow less than hoped this year and next, and factors including regional conflicts and the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak are putting a quick return to stronger growth at risk, the World Trade Organization said on Tuesday. Trade in goods will grow by 3.1 percent this year, much less than the 4.7 percent the WTO forecast in April. It cited "weaker-than expected GDP growth and muted import demand in the first half," according to a statement. Trade was likely to grow 4.0 percent in 2015 rather than the 5. ...

That's the best-case scenario. The worst case scenario is 1.5 million people infected in Sierra Leone and Liberia by January. Guinea wasn't included in the estimate because the cases there have varied in ways that can't be reliably modeled. To end the epidemic in January, about 70 percent of people who are infected need to be treated at an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> treatment facility or at home to reduce disease transmission, according to CDC data.

                                Studying ocean animals can be a tough gig. By simply observing them you change their environment. You can try to get as close as possible by boat, but you run the risk of stressing the animals out or scaring them off. Alternatively, you can get in a plane and observe them from the air — but flying can be risky, and you can't get very close to the animals because of the noise. Cue Amanda Hodgson, a researcher at Murdoch University in Australia, who is taking a different approach to marine research: She's using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), better known as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drone">Drone</a></span>s give researchers an eagle-eye view of their subjects, enabling them to count individuals easily and thereby determine the population's size, keep tabs on migration patterns, and assess the species' overall health. They are helpful not only in research, but in keeping poachers away. The benefits of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s In a case study published last year in PLOS One, Hodgson and her colleagues used a small aerial <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> (shown launching on the right) to survey dugongs, manatee-like marine mammals, in Shark Bay, Australia — the first Australian UAV survey trial. The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> captured 627 images containing dugongs, and the researchers were also able to identify a range of other marine animals, including whales, dolphins, and turtles. These are some of the images they captured, with dugongs outlined in red (click for larger images to see the animals): Since then, she's conducted two additional, currently unpublished trials with the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s — another one searching for dugongs, and one with humpback whales. These studies paired human observers with the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s to test the accuracy of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s compared to people. The results are still pending, but so far Hodgson believes <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s have high potential when it comes to marine research. There are several reasons for this. "Probably the biggest [advantage] for a lot of people is the fact that it's human risk-free, Hodgson told Business Insider. Humans out in the open ocean are at risk of weather events or mechanical failures, and in her dugong paper, Hodgson estimates that at least 11 people have been killed during manned aerial surveys. These unmanned <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s not only save human lives, but there are a number of other perks, Hodgson added. Small <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are "greener" than manned aircraft because they use much less gas. And, because they don't require a runway to get in the air, they can be launched from just about anywhere — including from boats in the middle of the ocean — allowing researchers to survey areas humans wouldn't ordinarily be able to get to. Most importantly, Hodson said, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are more reliable than human eyes and memory. "You have a permanent record of every sighting so you can confirm the numbers and species much more easily," she said. Not just for Dugongs Hodgson isn't the only researcher taking to the skies. Wayne Perryman is another researcher at the forefront of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>-based research in the US. He's used UAVs to monitor penguins and leopard seals in Antarctica, and more recently has taken his <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s out to sea to study sperm whales and orcas in their native habitats. Perryman, who works with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Southwest Fisheries Science Center, believes <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s have the potential to be less obtrusive and stressful to marine animals than boats, which pollute the ocean with noise. After flying <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s at various heights over orcas — even as low as 30 feet overhead — he and his team observed no reactions from the animals. "I think with large whales, with these little electric driven, multi-engine copters, you could probably land on one before it would notice," he told Business Insider. This also means that <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are useful for more than observation — one Massachusetts college wants to collect whale mucus by swooping in and catching spray from the whales' blowholes. They've been testing the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s by flying them over "surrogate" whales built from catamarans, as seen below (or, check out the full video):And <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s aren't just useful at sea — organizations like Conservation <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drone">Drone</a></span>s are finding <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> applications in research and conservation on land, like monitoring birds. And, in addition to Perryman's whale research, NOAA has an entire program devoted to using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s for environmental research, including taking atmospheric samples and surveying sea lion populations. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drone">Drone</a></span>s can also be used to fight off threats of the non-environmental kind: Kenya just announced plans to deploy <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in all of its national parks and reserves giving rangers 24-hour aerial surveillance for poachers. Last year, more than 1,000 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa alone, and elephants face similar threats — but <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s equipped with infrared cameras can pinpoint poachers as they try to creep up on the animals in the dark. The video below is a field test conducted by researchers from the University of Maryland in South Africa, demonstrating a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>'s effective infrared capabilities (click here to check out the full video): Revolutionary, but not necessarily legal While Hodgson and Perryman have made significant advances in using <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s for research, significant obstacles stand in their way. The Federal Aviation Administration has strict rules when it comes to the commercial use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s — an umbrella that includes scientific research. Before proceeding with any work involving <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s, researchers must obtain a certificate of authorization, which is only available to public entities like government agencies or public (but not private) universities. That puts a strict limit on who can do <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>-based research, including cutting most conservation organizations out of the game. On the other hand, recreational <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> use is far less regulated. This can sometimes be a boon to wildlife enthusiasts, enabling them to capture videos like this one of a dolphin stampede:Videos like the one above, shot by Dave Anderson, can be great tools for raising public awareness about certain species, but in most cases are not reliable enough for use by researchers. Changing the conservation game But Perryman is hopeful: the FAA is expected to release an updated set of regulations for small UAVs at the end of the year, which could make the process easier for scientists hoping to use <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s in their research. Even without laxer regulations, Perryman said, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s are likely to become ubiquitous as research tools. "I see these <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span>s as becoming just like a pair of binoculars, just something else you take in the field," he said. "And when the opportunity presents itself, you take advantage of them." That goes for all kinds of science, added Hodgson, the pioneering dugong researcher. "There's so many applications for UAVs, and people are already really looking into all the different possibilities," she said. "It's undoubtedly going to be a tool that a lot of researchers use." <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: Amazing Dolphin Stampede Caught On <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drone">Drone</a></span> Video SEE ALSO: Here's An Incredible Rare View Of A Baby Humpback Whale And Its Mother Off The Hawaii Coast Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                Warnings about the current <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> epidemic in West Africa, which has sickened more people than all previous outbreaks combined, have been dire for a while now. In March, a Doctors Without Borders official called it "an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen." By June, the organization was already warning that it was "totally out of control." In early September, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said we still had a chance to stop the outbreak, but that the "window of opportunity [was] closing." Soon after, President Obama sounded the alarm in a press conference, saying the epidemic was "spiraling out of control," and the World Bank called the potential economic impacts of the outbreak "catastrophic." Now, a new paper in the New England Journal of Medicine by a team of World Health Organization researchers estimates that if current trends continue, the number of confirmed and probable cases will rise to 20,000 by November 1, with almost half of those cases in Liberia: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also released projections on Tuesday, using a new modeling tool that ended up with different numbers than the predictions published in the NEJM. They estimated that reported cases in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea could rise to 8,000 by the end of September. But the CDC also noted that cases seem to be vastly underreported, perhaps by a factor of 2.5. According to the new projections, the true number of cases by the end of September could — worst case scenario — rise to 21,000. "If conditions continue without scale-up of interventions," the CDC researchers warned, "cases will continue to double approximately every 20 days, and the number of cases in West Africa will rapidly reach extraordinary levels." Still, the researchers said, "the findings also indicate that the epidemic can be controlled," and the international community has already begun mobilizing to help avoid the worst-case-scenario predictions. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is spread via bodily fluids, and isolating patients and their contacts is the most effective way to contain it.  The CDC projections — based on data from August — "reflect a moment in time before recent significant increases in efforts to improve treatment and isolation," said CDC director Tom Frieden in a statement. "They do not account for actions taken or planned since August by the United States and the international community. We anticipate that these actions will slow the spread of the epidemic." <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: The Real Reason This <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> Outbreak Is So Big Don't miss: Here's The Scariest Thing About <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                BedZED in Hackbridge, London. Tom Chance, CC BY-SA The primary goal of home energy efficiency initiatives might be to reduce total energy consumption, but these projects could have a negative impact on public health if we do not take care. Global climate change has been called the biggest global public health threat of the 21st century – and energy efficiency is a key tool in our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission levels. Efficiency projects allow us to more effectively manage energy consumption growth without sacrificing services that we value. In the cost-optimised 2°C scenario set out by the International Energy Agency (the temperature rise that we have to stick within if we’re to mitigate climate change), end-use efficiency improvements are responsible for 38% of the global emissions reductions between now and 2050. Without these emissions decreases, the World Health Organisation expects 250,000 additional deaths to occur each year, caused by climate-related malnutrition, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria">malaria</a></span>, diarrhoea and heat stress around the globe. Given these numbers, it seems logical to push forward with blanketing energy efficiency investments. However, there is evidence to show that we must take care in how we implement projects. In a 2014 article published in the British Medical Journal, James Milner and his co-authors outlined how some home energy efficiency improvements could cost lives by increasing indoor radon exposure and the resultant risk of developing lung cancer. According to the authors, energy efficiency projects could lead to an estimated 56.6% increase in average indoor radon concentrations. They calculate that the corresponding increase in radon exposure could lead to 278 premature deaths (the equivalent of 4,700 life years lost) each year in the UK. After smoking, radon exposure is the most important risk factor in developing lung cancer. This colourless gas, which occurs naturally from the indirect decay product of uranium or <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=thorium">thorium</a></span>, can be found in indoor air. It produces a radioactive dust that is trapped in our airways. This radiation then causes lung damage and increases the chance that we will develop lung cancer. Each year, an estimated 1,400 cases of lung cancer in the UK are primarily due to radon exposure, and about 21,000 in the US. The increased radon concentrations in the Milner study stem from the fact that many energy efficiency improvements alter the way that buildings exchange indoor and outdoor air. These alterations are often aimed at reducing energy losses due to leaky windows or drafts around unsealed doors. In turn, these buildings can be more effectively heated and cooled, leading to observable public health improvements and decreases in total energy use. However, they can increase some health risks. According to Milner and co-authors, while an individual project can be “good for energy efficiency, indoor temperatures in winter and protection against outdoor pollutants, it has the potential to increase concentrations of pollutants arising from sources inside or underneath the home.” A 2013 study suggested similar risks in retrofitted buildings from mould growth and “sick building syndrome”, where occupants appear to experience health issues from occupancy in a building. By trapping humidity inside the building, energy efficiency retrofits could unintentionally lead to dangerous mould growth. In turn, people in these buildings would be more prone to chronic fatigue, irritated lungs, and watery eyes. Using fans and other equipment to carefully control the indoor air quality could reduce or eliminate the negative co-impacts documented in these studies. Of course, the use of these technologies would offset some of the energy savings. But, they could also prevent an array of illnesses, which could stymie future energy efficiency proposals. Energy efficiency projects can help to reduce total energy consumption. They are a key part of mitigating the impacts of global climate change. But we must be aware of any potential negative co-impacts on human health and take care to reduce their effect. One of the co-authors of the BMJ study mentioned in the article is Melissa Lott's secondary PhD supervisor.

                                If you dream of seeing regularly scheduled missions to the Moon, youre not alone. While some companies are taking a more conventional approach, like developing rockets specially-designed to lower launch costs, other space-bound firms are pursuing less traditional means. Enter LiftPort: a company that hopes to build a space elevator system designed to greatly simplify missions to the Moon.  LiftPort President Michael Laine was working with NASAs Institute for Advanced Concepts in the early 2000s when he first began exploring the idea of a mechanism that could get people and cargo to space while remaining tethered to Earth.  The concept is pretty straightforward, at least in theory. Imagine you have a ball on a string and you spin it around your head. Get it spinning fast enough and the string will stay taut. Now imagine that string is around 500 kilometers long and is anchored to the Earth's surface rather than your hand. The other end is in anchored in orbit, attached to a spacecraft. Youd get the same taut string between the two points, and itd be possible to build a system to climb up a taut string. Thats the space elevator. But we dont have the material means to build a space elevator just yet. What we do have, Laine told me, is the capability to build a version of a space elevator connecting the Earth and the Moon. Just add about 238,000 kilometers to our string above. About two and a half years ago, Laine struck out to try and bring this idea to reality. WHILE IT WILL EXTEND TOWARDS THE PLANET, IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY TOUCH IT The concept behind the Moon elevator is still similar to the ball on the string, but a little more complicated because of the Moons slow orbit around the Earth. The solution lies in Lagrangian points. These are the points of gravitational equilibrium between two bodies. It's here that the gravitational pull of both bodies are equal, and so they cancel each other out. Lagrangian point L1 is about 55,000 kilometers from the Moon, and thats the one Laine hopes to take advantage of. After anchoring one end of the string on the Moons surface, it will extend to L1, then from L1 towards Earth. While it will extend towards the planet, it will not actually touch it. At the end of the string will be a counterweight made up of all the spent pieces of rocket that launched the initial mission to get the spike into the Moon. The counterweight will be in the right place for the Earth to pull on it gravitationally, but it will be anchored, through the Lagrange point, to the Moon. The force on both halves of the string will keep it taut. And that taut string will be a space elevator to the Moon. Whats more, said Laine, is that the Moon elevator can be built off-the-shelf, with readily available technology. A prototype could be built and deployed within a decade for as little as $800 million, according to him. It would be a small version exerting just a few pounds of force on the anchor on the Moon, but it would lay the groundwork for larger follow-up systems that could transport more cargo and eventually astronauts. Theres a lot of work to do before LiftPort can launch its Moon elevator. Up next for the company is a proof-of-concept demonstration that will see a robot climb the tallest freestanding human structure in existence. WHAT'S MORE, SAID LAINE, IS THAT THE MOON ELEVATOR CAN BE BUILT OFF-THE-SHELF, WITH READILY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY Using three large <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helium">helium</a></span> balloons held together on a tripod, Laines team will unroll a giant spool of Vectran fiber into the air. Vectran, the same material NASA used to make the airbags that cushioned Spirit and Opportunitys landings on Mars, is a material that gets stronger as it gets colder, making it ideal for a high altitude test. The thread will be just an eighth of an inch think but able to support 1,400 pounds and withstand strong winds. This high altitude test will be LiftPorts 15th experiment and the 20th robot to attempt an ascent. It will also be the first test using a Moon elevator-type string rather than an Earth elevator-type ribbon. Ribbons offer a larger surface area for the robot to grip, so preparing a test using a string has been a technological balancing act to find a motor large enough, robotic wheels strong enough, and a battery powerful enough to climb the string. This is not to mention the logistical balancing act of clearing airspace for the test. Laine doesnt have a prospective date for when this test will happen. Well fly when were ready, he said, stressing that hes unwilling to go prematurely. Failure in a public arena would set the project back years, and this test will be very public because Ben Harrison has been filming the whole thing for a new documentary. Harrison found out about LiftPort by chance; he stumbled upon the companys 2012 Kickstarter campaign and, as a space fan, donated to the project. He was also working for Engadget at the time and ended up filming a brief ten-minute spot about Laine for the website. But he wanted to tell more of the story, and so he approached Laine with a pitch for a documentary about the space elevator. Laine agreed. Harrisons is an independent project with independent vision, and hes been lucky to get very deep and generous access to Laines project. That also means hes been able to capture the humanity behind LiftPort, because while some companies might hide failures, Laine hasnt. Harrison has seen, and caught on film, some pretty interesting technical foul-ups. But Laine doesnt mind. With crowdfunding behind a significant source of money for LiftPort, he feels transparency and honesty are key. And besides, big technologies rarely, if ever, go from concept to execution without some problems, and this documentary isnt a story about Laine, its about the project. Harrison and his team plan to ask for public support via Kickstarter so they can finish the documentary, called Shoot the Moon, and share it with the world.

                                Earlier this year, a group of astronomers made a very high-profile announcement: They had, for the first time ever, detected the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ripple">ripple</a></span> structures in distant space indicative of gravitational waves, remnants of the theorized cosmic inflationary period that occurred after the Big Bang.  The group, which used the BICEP2 telescope to make their observations, was met with immediate skepticism. For one thing, the skeptics argued, they had underestimated a crucial complicating factor: dust. As gravitational waves might leave a signature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), dust might leave a similar mark.  A report out this week from the European Space Agency found that there would have indeed been enough dust in the patch of sky being observed by the BICEP2 astronomers to account for the would-be gravitational wave observations. Posted to the arVix preprint server, the ESA study found that the signal frequencies involved with interstellar dust polarization and structures in the CMB are just too similar.  "We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting regions there are no 'clean' windows in the sky where primordial CMB B-mode polarization measurements could be made without subtraction of foreground emission," the ESA astronomers wrote, the foreground emission here being dust. The dust component of the interstellar medium isn't all that much like dust as we know it That in itself is an interesting notion: space is dirty. We might look up at the night sky and imagine a pristine cosmos, where blackness indicates emptiness. That's hardly the case, however, and it's often quite the opposite, with that blackness the result of dust clouds shielding us from the visible frequencies of light.  Dust is part of what's known as the interstellar medium. The medium is mostly (99 percent) gas, about 75 percent hydrogen, with most of the rest being <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helium">helium</a></span>. If these gases become gravitationally unbalanced and collapse, the eventual result is a star.  The dust component of the interstellar medium isn't all that much like dust as we know it. For one, grains of cosmic dust are tiny, a fraction of a micron across. Usually composed of carbon or some variety of silicate with a bit of iron or ice, these atoms and molecules might form into clumps, typically surrounding a star-in-progress. They might eventually clump enough to begin forming planets. Image: NASA While interstellar dust can block out entire galaxies from view, as with the Horsehead Nebula above, its density is almost incomprehensibly low. We might find one single atom occupying a cubic-centimeter of otherwise mostly vacuum. Meanwhile, a cubic-centimeter of the air that we breathe will contain somewhere around 30,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms, according astronomers at the University of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span>. The usual size of interstellar dust particles happens to match well with the wavelength of blue light. This leads to another feature of these space-clouds called "reddening." As light from a distant galaxy travel through cosmic dust, its blue components get scattered, leaving the light that actually makes it to Earth appear more red. If an observer were to observe the same cloud from the side, it would appear to be blue. This is the case with the Egg Nebula, pictured above. Image: NASA There's an interesting third possibility. A cloud of cosmic dust might act as a mirror, reflecting light from some bright object and directing it towards Earth. This is called a reflection nebula, an example of which was detected by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, a structure known just as NGC 1999. Dust is an old problem for astronomers. Edward Barnard is usually given credit for the first direct observation of interstellar dust clouds, describing them as "dark markings" and "curiosities of the sky" in a 1919 paper.  "I first did not believe in these dark obscuring masses," Barnard wrote. "The increase of evidence, however, from my own photographs convinced me later, especially after investigating some of them visually, that many of these markings were not simply due to an actual want of stars, but were really obscuring bodies nearer to us than distant stars." He went on to catalog a number of them, in part to aid in future study. The source of interstellar dust remains at least somewhat elusive. The going theory is that it comes from stars, a byproduct. "From the stellar winds of evolved stars, new dust is formed and is injected into interstellar space," explained astronomer Amara Graps in a 1996 report. "Young stardust is mixed with old, heavily-processed, diffuse ISM dust, and is subject to passing supernova shocks and ultraviolet radiation." "Dusty clouds form," she said. "The protostar environment is a fertile ground for solids on all size scales from dust grains to planets." So, it's hard to really resent these clouds of cosmic dust, blocking our view of Big Bang history or not. They're what we're all made of: star stuff.

                                The Pentagon confirms that US and 'partner nation forces' have commenced large-scale bombing raids against Islamic State extremists in Syria in a fresh offensive against the fighters of the Islamic State (ISIL) using cruise missiles, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> and warplanes. The attacks, which opened with a barrage of cruise missiles from US navy warships, represent a major escalation of Mr Obama's war against ISIL, The strikes, which included contributions from as yet officially unspecified "partner nations" were announced by the Pentagon late last night and were concentrated around the city of Raqqa, the militants' main stronghold close to the border with Iraq. Unconfirmed reports cite those partners included Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Bahrain, although their exact roles in the military action were unclear. The strike against ISIL is an unprecedented and unexpected show of regional solidarity against the terrorist group that has rampaged through Syria and Iraq.

                                By Valerie Volcovici NEW YORK (Reuters) - With crises from Islamic State to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> competing for attention, the United Nations on Tuesday will zero in on climate change, giving leaders from 125 countries a platform to explain how they plan to address the issue. A huge march to call for international action on climate change, which brought as many as 400,000 people to the streets of New York on Sunday, set the tone for the summit spearheaded by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ...

                                So it begins. EPA/US Navy/Roderick Eubanks The United States has commenced major air operations against the Islamic State (IS) in Syria. Aircraft from bases in the Gulf, supported by air-to-air refuelling, struck a substantial range of targets in and around the city of Raqqa in northern Syria, hitting leadership sites, training facilities, munitions stores and supply lines. The White House has stated that other states in the region are directly involved; and Pentagon sources have listed these as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Bahrain, with Qatar playing a supporting role. The US also used <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> and sea-launched cruise missiles – the latter most likely fired from a US Navy guided missile destroyer in the eastern Mediterranean. Why has the US suddenly expanded the air war by going for the heart of the Islamic State’s power base in Raqqa? The answer almost certainly lies with what has happened in the past six weeks in the ongoing air war in Iraq. A losing battle There, more than 190 air strikes on close to 250 targets have done little more than blunt some of IS’s recent advances, and have conspicuously failed to stop the group from making gains elsewhere. Indeed, as the strikes in Iraq rolled on, the news came of a major advance by IS units operating out of one of the group’s core areas of strength, Fallujah. They have finally overrun the nearby Camp Saqlawiya, an Iraqi Army base that had been under siege for a week. It is not clear how many soldiers died or were taken hostage at the base, but the numbers look likely to be in the high hundreds. More generally, the new government of prime minister Haider al-Abadi has so far failed to convince key Sunni clans in western and north-western Iraq that it will run a more inclusive regime; as a result, clan leaders are far too suspicious to work alongside government forces. With its surgical, incremental strategy confounded by the chaos in Iraq, the Obama administration has opted for a singularly high-risk strategy: an attempt to weaken IS by going for its core forces. Backlash The risks are considerable. There is already evidence that IS paramilitaries have been acting much more carefully in Iraq, integrating more closely into the urban areas rather than being caught out in the open. This has limited the potential use of air power and we can be sure that the IS leadership will have expected this sudden escalation into Syria and will have dispersed many of its militias and their supplies. Meanwhile, IS propagandists are already at work, spreading the message that Sunni Islam is once more under attack by the “far enemy” of the US, pointing to civilian casualties as evidence. The White House may point to its alliance with regional Sunni states, but this will simply provide fodder for IS proponents, allowing them to remind their followers that they are just as much opposed to the “near enemy” of unacceptable regimes allied to Washington. Now a known participant in the US’s “coalition of the willing”, Jordan may come under particular threat from radicals in its own backyard. The paramilitaries fighting for IS include many highly skilled and determined young men who gained extensive combat experience against US soldiers and Marines in urban environments in Iraq, especially from 2003 to 2008. These fighters know all about being exposed to air attacks; they are highly disciplined, ruthless and determined. The US’s actions, which will continue for days and weeks at least, will undoubtedly have an immediate effect. This may be hailed as significant progress – but real caution is required, since we can expect a thoroughly unpleasant response from the militants. Fight the real enemy But the media focus on IS already starting to look myopic. There are strong indications that the most dangerous threat towards Western countries comes not from IS but from a much more shadowy group based in Syria: Khorasan. Led by a former close aide to Osama bin Laden, Muhsin al-Fadhli, Khorasan is operating out of Syria and has links with what is left of al-Qaeda in Pakistan. It’s focused much more on global Jihad, and is currently quite separate from IS. Al-Fadhli himself is only in his mid-30s, but was linked with the al-Qaida leadership as far back as 2001; he was reportedly one of the few people to know in advance about the 9/11 attacks. In the short term, Washington is presenting this rapidly accelerating war as a decisive action to permanently cripple IS. It may well look like a success at first – but that will almost certainly be highly misleading. In reality, the Third Iraq War, now extended into Syria, is merely in its very early stages.

                                Spectators can attribute the positive qualities of the sport they're watching to the supplements and sports drinks being promoted. vijay chennupati/Flickr, CC BY-SA Sporting bodies shouldn’t unconditionally accept sponsorship from nutritional supplements and sports drinks companies because a link with sports lends undue credibility to these unproven products. In an article just published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, my colleague and I argue such sponsorship misleads the public into thinking the products are inevitably good for health, fitness, and well-being. Sport sponsorship – and its promotional cousin celebrity endorsement – can deliver massive mutual benefits. Consider the Nike–Michael Jordan relationship: basketball participation expanded, and Jordan became the world’s most recognisable athlete while Nike became the planet’s dominant sports shoe supplier. But sponsorship can also be problematic. During the 1970s and 1980s, for instance, the tobacco industry embedded itself in sport, and often paid for the naming rights for events and leagues. In the light of incontrovertible evidence that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer and other ill health, governments banned direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products. The vacuum this left was quickly filled by multinational food and beverage companies, such as Coca Cola, Nestle, and McDonald’s, alongside alcohol brands. These are by no means health-promoting products, and despite their link with sports, don’t add to their legitimacy. But sponsorship by nutritional supplement and sports drinks companies is more complicated. These products appear to encourage healthy living, and exercise, and both are linked to the ethos of sport, which is to fine-tune the body’s capacity to perform. Amino acids help build muscle, for instance, while high-energy drinks can stall the onset of fatigue. Still, there’s a problematic side to the regular use of supplements and sports drinks; the health and performance benefits of many of the products remain unproven. While a beverage with high levels of caffeine might provide a short-term energy boost, its effect can be severely moderated by the dose, the time when it’s taken, and the nature of the sporting activity. And while multivitamin capsules are promoted as immune system stimulants and energy boosters, supporting evidence is thin. Supplements and sports drinks can also have serious health implications. Advertising implies these products are benign but large doses of caffeine can trigger irregular heart rhythm, and lead to anxiety attacks. And a daily diet of energy drinks can lead to obesity and diabetes because of their sugar content. To athletes, supplements also pose a risk of doping as they sometimes contain prohibited substances. Ingesting prohibited substances lead to sanctions regardless of any intention or knowledge of their presence. These problems are compounded when the products are linked to sponsorship deals because spectators attribute the positive qualities of the sport they’re watching to the product being promoted. The link can lead to a seamless association whereby the product (in this case nutritional supplements and sport drinks) comes to be seen as not only as integral to sport, but also part of the overall experience. By accepting their sponsorship, various sporting codes lend unwarranted credibility to products that would not otherwise be seen as beneficial or healthy. The issue has already prompted disquiet among sporting authorities, and many sports organisations have publicly distanced themselves from claims about their endorsement of supplement use. The American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine have issued a joint statement highlighting how supplements only benefit specific sports (creatine use for high-intensity sports, such as weight lifting and sprinting, for instance). They also point out that the majority of the supplements on the market fall into the category of ergogenic <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aids">aids</a></span> that do not perform as claimed. Similarly, the Irish Rugby Football Union recently noted: the increased popularity of such products, across all ages and all sports, may be due to a lack of understanding of the claims made by manufacturers, many of which are not backed up by scientific evidence. Meanwhile, the World Anti-Doping Authority (WADA) says the use of dietary supplements is cause for concern because their manufacture and labels aren’t regulated. And this could mean supplements contain undeclared substances that are prohibited under anti-doping regulations. These statements stand in stark contrast to the ubiquitous supplements and drinks sponsorship of sports teams and events. The unease sporting authorities feel about endorsing these products is cause for caution about nutritional supplements and sports drink consumption and sponsorship. While it may not be sufficient for sporting codes to ditch such sponsorship, it should warn them against entering arrangements without first undertaking a “due diligence” test.

                                Head and neck cancer underway. Akira Kouchiyama, CC BY-SA Immune cells in the blood primarily defend us against infection. But we’re now learning that these cells can also keep us free from cancer. Patients with less efficient immune systems such as organ transplant recipients or those with untreated <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, for example, are more susceptible to cancers. It is also becoming increasingly apparent that we can use immune cells to predict survival in people who do develop cancer. And that, in fact, there are immune cells within cancers. The number of immune cells inside a tumour can hugely vary: some patients have vast numbers while some have very few. In a recent study, we showed that in head and neck cancers, the survival of a patient depends on how many immune cells are within the tumour. This could be a valuable way of individualising cancer treatments. Patients with lots of immune cells, for example, could be offered less toxic cancer treatment while those with few immune cells may need more aggressive treatment to improve their chances of survival. Not all immune cells within the tumour are able to “attack” the cancer. By looking at specific cell markers – proteins on the cell exterior that allow us to see whether, for example, cells are exhausted – we can determine which individual immune cells in the tumour will be effective in tackling the cancer, or if they are exhausted and not able to perform any useful function. It’s possible that these exhausted cells could be reinvigorated to become useful again with targeted immunotherapy treatments currently in development. These include vaccines, so if a cancer has been caused by a virus, we can vaccinate the patient with a short segment of the same virus to encourage the immune system to react to it. Around 30% of head and neck cancers, for example, are the result of human papillomavirus (HPV). There has been a 225% increase in these types of cancers over the past 15-20 years and in the US, HPV will cause more of these cancers than cervical ones. In these cases, cancer cells continue to express part of the HPV on their surface. The hope is that following vaccination, immune cells will be better able to identify these HPV cancer cells and kill them. For people who simply don’t have many immune cells in tumours, specific, targeted immunotherapy could be one option. But also broader “brush stroke” treatments. These broader treatments cover all immunotherapies that encourage a patient’s immune system in a fairly non-specific way. Our immune cells are normally very tightly regulated and include many fail-safe systems to prevent them from over-reacting primarily to infections. General immunotherapy takes the brakes off and allows the immune cells to react to the cancer cells. It may be that a combination of specific vaccine and non-specific immune treatments could be enough in combination to tip the balance in favour of the patient’s immune system so that it is able to overcome the cancer. We’re going to further investigate how immune cells might help us to fight cancer and two head and neck cancer immunotherapy trials are due to start at the University of Southampton in the next six months. One of these trials will look at a HPV cancer vaccine, while the other will investigate a non-specific immunotherapy molecule for those 70% of patients that develop head and neck cancer independent of HPV. Our hope is that within five years the results of these trials could influence the way we treat cancers. Emma King receives funding from CRUK.

                                Knowing your DNA will is not a panacea. PA/Harvard University Walter Gilbert won the Nobel Prize in 1980 in Chemistry for his contribution to sequence DNA, or “determination of base sequences in a nucleic acid”. Mohit Kumar Jolly, researcher at Rice University and contributor to The Conversation, interviewed him at the 2014 Lindau Nobel Laureates Meeting. You received the Nobel Prize for DNA sequencing. When do you think we will be able to get our genomes sequenced cheaply? Sequencing is definitely becoming cheaper and more accessible. One can sequence a couple of full genomes today for less than US$50,000. In 1985, human DNA sequencing cost was thought to be around US$3 billion. I hope that by 2020, drug stores can do genome sequencing for a few hundred dollars. But, one must be careful – whole genome sequencing is not at all accurate for medical diagnosis. I got my own genome sequenced, but they missed the local rearrangements in my genome – it was not well-curated. Also, it is common belief that once we can sequence the genome, we can edit it to have babies with higher IQ for example. This is a myth, because it is very rare that one gene corresponds to one property. What do you think about the prospects of personalised medicine? I support the cause of personalised medicine. I believe that it has two underlying themes – each one of us has different metabolism and each one of us has a different manifestation of the same disease. My cancer is not the same as your cancer, so the only way one can categorise ultimately is to have a limited number of subtypes and then develop drugs against those subtypes. But as you can see, big pharma companies of course do not want people to believe in personalised medicine. Otherwise how would they sell their generic drugs? I don’t understand why they don’t realise that clinical trials get easier and much cheaper with subtyping – they do not play this market game well. What are your views on “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>”? <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big data">Big data</a></span> promises to collect large sets of data and find associations between genes and diseases. There’s definitely something useful in the data collected, but the danger is that we have no clue how to interpret it. Also, you must remember that all statistically significant things are not biologically significant. So, it is definitely not a panacea. There was a recent controversy about patenting genes. What did you make of that? I agree with the US Supreme Court decision that one cannot patent anything that exists naturally. Since a gene is a part of the genome, I don’t think one should be allowed to patent it. But companies are allowed to patent some genetic tests that identify risks for certain diseases based on one’s genes. What problems does science face today? We are spending money on problems that can have immediate outcomes. Then we are forced to use only our current level of understanding. There is a lot that what we don’t know. Imagine that if we had asked Benjamin Franklin to justify the importance of the “spark” he had found, would we have had electricity today? Another major problem is the explosion in scientific manpower that has not necessarily led to the betterment of science, especially in biology. In fact, bad material that gets published has increased. In biology, the top journals – Cell, Science and Nature – have created a mess. They tell the authors “give me the headline, not the data”. And then we see retractions and shattered careers and dreams. What advice would you like to give to young scientists? Do not blindly believe whatever you read. I often used to give my students papers that said opposite things and then tell them to explain to me how they were consistent, if at all. Also, do not continue science if it does not excite you. Science cannot be a nine-to-five job.

Another guy is busy typing away at his laptop, while two teammates are closely examining a microwave to see if they can subject it to the same fate as the toaster. It's so useful. You'll be able to perfectly cook chicken, Mayank Gulati, the one mangling the toaster oven said to me. It's eleven hours into Hack the North, Canada's largest and first ever international hackathon, and the team is trying to make a bunch of household appliances controllable through a smartphone. Roughly 1,000 people, or about 250 teams, descended on the University of Waterloo's campus for the hackathon. Most participants, some from schools as far away as the Netherlands and China, came armed with their laptops. The rules were simple: create something awesome using available technology within 36 hours and then pitch it to a panel of judges in 100 seconds or less. The hack in hackathon, refers to the old-school definition: finding a creative, unconventional way to manipulate technology, in unintended ways. The basic idea of the event is to throw a bunch of code-smart, creative, builder-types, into the same space for a day and a half—then see the impressive results by the end of it. Add in some old and brand new hardware to the mix, like Thalmic's Myo armband—which senses electrical activity from wearers' muscles to tell what gestures and rotations their arms are making—and you're in for some interesting inventions. Canada's Hack the North was inspired by American hackathons like MHacks, an annual event hosted at the University of Michigan. We [the organizers] had been to these hackathons [in the U.S.] just as participants and we were just blown away. And we were thinking, 'Why doesn't this happen at Waterloo? This needs to come to Waterloo,' said co-organizer Valentin Tsatskin. And we were like, 'Okay, let's do it!' Close to a year of planning later and the Waterloo students made Hack the North come together with tech industry sponsors like Bloomberg, Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla and Yelp, while Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky, 500px CEO Andy Yang, and Brilliant CEO and founder Sue Khim, judged the event. The Engineering 5 building at U of Waterloo, normally used for classes and student lounges, became ground zero, with hackers spread out on all six floors. The lobby in another nearby engineering building was converted into a makeshift nap area with hammocks and mats strewn everywhere. Besides the main hacking project, participants also attended a variety of talks and workshops throughout the weekend, taking part in midnight coding challenges on Sunday, where four tablets were awarded to the winners. Let's start the mother fucking microwave demo, yelled Austin Feight, from the toaster oven and microwave team, into his phone Sunday morning. Seconds later, the microwave timer set itself to 99:99 and the plate inside began spinning. After hours of hacking, the microwave and toaster oven were fully operational over smartphone voice commands, with the cooking temperatures adjustable, and the system sending out texts after the cooking was complete. The judges chose ten winning teams Sunday afternoon (sadly, Feight's team didn't make the cut). Some of the winning hacks included Lend, a website that connects users who want to rent objects, described as an Airbnb for things. The same hackers also created a mobile-compatible version with a functioning <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> client. Another winning hack—Open Pokmon—is an Android application that renders real-life maps into Pokmon-style graphics, allowing users to fight wild Pokmon anywhere, and challenge other users they encounter on the map, to battles. The game is also activated through voice-command, so users literally tell their Pokmon what attacks to use. One team created a special door lock that can be unlocked by tapping a smartphone with a corresponding app installed on it. The owner of the lock can give people access based on Facebook events. If someone is listed as "going" to your party, instead of answering the door a hundred times, guests can tap their phones to the lock and unlock the door. But if your party friends switch their statuses to "not going," they won't be able to unlock it. Considering the participant and sponsor turnout, Hack the North is on the rise and this likely won't be its last year. There's also no surprise the event was held in Waterloo—a huge tech hub in Canada, with U of Waterloo serving as Canada's engineering mecca and one of the top 50 universities in that discipline worldwide. And the entire event is a sign of Canada's growing prominence in the technology sector, with big corporate sponsors in attendance (likely for recruitment), giving talented students the platform to not just showcase their inventions, but themselves, to elite tech sector players.  Ultimately, with companies like Facebook in the US already embracing similar hackathon culture—Hack the North shows the same thinking is north of the border in Canada, too. Correction: An earlier version of this article identified Austin Feight as David Fontenot. We regret the error.

                                The CIA has notoriously been, well, "innovative" in developing new interrogation techniques (if you consider waterboarding an innovation, at least). Newly declassified documents reveal that willingness to experiment is nothing new: 30 years ago, the spy agency pitted one of its own agents against an artificial intelligence interrogator. The documents in question, written in 1983 and titled Interrogation of an Alleged CIA Agent, describe a series of experimental tests conducted in the early 1980s in which the CIA repeatedly interrogated its own agent, referred to in the report as Joe Hardesty, using a primitive AI called Analiza. The declassified document is both fascinating in its distinct retrofuture flavour and eerily prescient nature, because the US government is now set to use virtual entities to conduct national security interviews. Its also kind of hilarious, because the interrogation transcript reads like a conversation with a really frustrating chatbot. Heres a slice: AI: You had better straighten out your attitude, Joe, or it will be a long time before you ever leave this country. Hardesty: What do you mean by that crack? AI: You know what I mean. Hardesty: No, I do not. AI: Think about it. Hardesty: Why? AI: Why do you want to know why? Hardesty: You made a threat and I want an explanation. AI: I think the message is clear. Hardesty: What message? AI: Do you work for the American Central Intelligence Agency? Hardesty: Hell, no. AI: Why do you persist in lying to me? Hardesty: I am not lying. You have no right to treat me like this. The intelligence on display in the transcript is clearly undeveloped, and seems to contain a mixed bag of predetermined threats made to goad interrogation subjects into spilling their secrets as well as open-ended lines of questioning.  According to the document, Analiza consisted, in part, of a crude machine learning algorithm that stored Hardestys responses in its memory, along with a pre-set question bank that it could draw from. Other aspects of the program are probing Joes vulnerabilities, the document stated. AI records focus variables, Joes tendency to concentrate on various subjects, and profile variables to serve as indicators of Joes hostility, inquisitiveness, talkativeness, and understandability, and to pose questions about these. When your captor is a machine, there is no humaneness to be found, and, hence, no one to plead with Even way back then, the authors had a striking vision for future virtual entities that can learn on their own, adapt, and think abstractly. According to the document, the CIA believed it was possible that computers could adapt, pursue goals, modify themselves or other computers, and think abstractly.  Potential applications for computer algorithms like Analiza could include training recruits before they head into the field and face the risk of an interrogation with a human opponent, according to the document. The CIA, like the field of artificial intelligence itself, has come a long way since the 1980s, and algorithms that attempt to mimic brain processes (referred to as Advanced Neural Networks) like those being developed by Google have achieved many of the goals the CIA set decades ago. The agency itself is heavily invested in AI development today by way of its venture firm, In-Q-Tel, which recently gave a funding boost to Narrative Science, a company developing AI that can glean insight from data and turn it into a semi-readable news article. Enhanced interrogation techniques may very well take on a new, unsettling meaning if the CIAs technological fever dream of the 80s ever comes to fruition. AI interrogation, while presumably less violent and repugnant than waterboarding, for example, could present its own set of moral transgressions. When your captor is a machine, there is no humaneness to be found, and, hence, no one to plead with. When even that small avenue of humanity is done away with in the proceedings of state-sponsored barbarism, what is left? Illegal detainments could continue with only slight human involvement. Even though decades worth of development have passed since the CIAs initial dabbling with AI interrogation techniques, virtual entities that can converse naturally with humans are still far off.  The recent case of chatbot <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Eugene Goostman">Eugene Goostman</a></span>, which passed the Turing Test through trickery rather than genuine intelligence, demonstrated this. Even so, with government agencies like the CIA, DARPA, and powerful corporations like Google on the case, the possibility might be closer than we think.

                                Foreign minister Julie Bishop (right) says Australians travelling to West Africa must ensure their employers can evacuate them if they become ill as the government will not. Alan Porritt/AAP Well over 5,300 people have been infected and over 2,600 have died in the current <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> outbreak in West Africa. But these numbers are thought to be gross underestimates as even the most conservative projections now suggest a tenfold increase in deaths before we can hope to contain the outbreak. The international community has been slow to react to this unfolding humanitarian crisis, but in the past week new commitments have come from a variety of countries and institutions. So where is Australia in all this? Given the country is home to some of the world’s best-trained health-care workers and medical scientists, you might expect it to be sending teams of highly qualified people to help. Not helping, blocking The most notable assistance for the affected West African nations will arrive in the form of 3,000 US military personnel. They will help train health-care workers and build 17 new 100-bed patient care facilities. The United Kingdom has announced that it too is sending military personnel to the region to assist. The Chinese government has sent a mobile laboratory for testing for the virus and a 59-person team of epidemiologists, clinicians and nurses. Cuba has sent 165 health professionals. Late last week, the United Nations established a new mission for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> Emergency Response (UNMEER), and the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution (2177) declaring <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> “a threat to international peace and security”. This development alone, which is only the second time in the history of the UN Security Council that it has declared a health issue a security threat, speaks to the gravity of the outbreak. Back on our shores, some 12 Australian doctors have already travelled overseas with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to help care for the sick and dying. But they have done so independently and without any support from the Australian government. In fact, to date the government’s response has been disappointing to say the least. Last week, the prime minister announced he was offering A$2.5 million to MSF, which has been providing frontline care to those infected. This was the response of the non-governmental organisation: Médecins Sans Frontières cannot accept any donation of funds from the Australian government. We have been asking countries, including Australia, to evaluate their emergency medical and logistics capacity and make a contribution beyond financial support for over two weeks now and we continue to urge them to do so. Another A$2.5 million has been allocated to the World Health Organisation to help upscale its efforts. A further A$2 million will be provided to the UK government to support its frontline activities in Sierra Leone. Beyond this, the government has not only ignored calls from the Australian Medical Association to assist countries affected by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> by sending medical experts. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced last week that any Australians travelling to West Africa must ensure their employers can extract them if they become ill as the government “did not have the capacity to evacuate them”. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> is a priority too Australia’s actions stand in clear contrast to the activities and measures offered by other countries, such as the US, the UK, China and Cuba. They also stand in stark contrast to the measures the government has proposed to combat the terror sect calling itself Islamic State (formerly ISIL or ISIS) in northern Iraq. These measures so far include an indeterminate commitment of over A$500 million per year and 600 troops. No rational individual can doubt that IS must be eliminated and that it will take considerable resources to do so. The Australian military is also ill-equipped to offer the type of assistance made available by the US and UK forces. Our military hasn’t been trained to do this type of work and we don’t have anywhere near enough military medical doctors and nurses to send overseas. Even so, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> poses a serious global threat and civilian health-care professionals are ready to be deployed. But the government’s refusal to guarantee it will help any Australian citizens come home if they get sick leaves the decision of whether people can go help to individual employers – and their insurance brokers. MSF has been overwhelmed by the need in West Africa; it is turning away patients because it simply doesn’t have the personnel or facilities to care for them. In the last few days, local health-care workers in some areas have been murdered over fears they may be spreading the virus. Money will undoubtedly be needed to help those governments affected by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> recover economically once this disaster is over. Until then, what is needed – and needed desperately, urgently – is people on the ground to help contain the outbreak. This means sending multidisciplinary teams of scientific, medical and humanitarian experts, supported by security personnel, to help as soon as possible. If left unchecked, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> poses just as big a threat to Australia’s national interests as Islamic extremists – both are conceivably just a plane ride away.

                                Stretching the limits. Hey Mr Glen, CC BY-NC When I was younger, about ten years old, I realised that everyone ages and dies. And I thought well why should that be? Can’t we do something about it? I then thought I’d do it. I’ll study ageing and figure it out, and I’ll find a solution so people don’t have to age and die. And that’s what I do today. Ageing is a decrease in viability and an increase in vulnerability. It means your capacity to respond to external stresses and to function decreases, making you more vulnerable to diseases. One of the major causes of mortality in the elderly is influenza, which is just the common flu. The thing with ageing, of course, is that it entails different levels – molecular, cellular, hormonal and physiological – different organs and different systems in the body, which makes it very complex and relatively difficult to study. We actually don’t know much about ageing in the sense of its mechanisms – how and why we age. And what drives the process of ageing is still relatively poorly understood. If you look at it evolutionarily, our lifespan has only recently been so long. Life expectancy is affected by numerous factors such as better nutrition and availability of vaccines, has increased. Around 150 years ago it was something like 40-years-old, and 1,000 years ago about 25 (figures vary depending on whether child mortality and death in childbirth are included). But even as we increasingly reach what appear to be the limits of lifespan, there is likely still scope for even longer lifespans. Why do we age? There are hypotheses that damage to DNA probably affects cell renewal in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span>, which in turn prevents repair in the body and contributes to loss of viability. Then there is the free radicals theory of ageing: the idea that as mitochondria in our cells burn energy with oxygen, it generates very highly reactive compounds, which creates damaging oxidative stress, which in turn accumulates with age and causes ageing. There are also things like telomeres, the tips of chromosomes that shorten with cell division. But because this also occurs with age (and is linked to cancer risk), people have said this drives the process of ageing. So after about age 30 your chances of dying double every eight years. This is fairly standard for human populations, no matter where you’re from or where you live. Third World countries may have higher mortality to begin with, but you still see this exponential increase in mortality. Longevity isn’t fixed But then you have very unique creatures. One example are birds. Now birds actually live longer than would be expected for them for their size, because they can fly and avoid predators. And one of the species that we are interested in is an organism called the naked mole rat, which lives for more than 30 years. Why? Because it lives in a protective environment. But then there is an evolutionary pressure to live longer. One of the interesting things about the naked mole rat is that it is extremely cancer resistant. There has not been a single case of cancer in hundreds of naked mole rats. So longevity is plastic. Not only there are species that live for much longer than we do, but there are species that appear not to age, like some species of turtles and tortoises. Probably one of the greatest breakthroughs in the field so far is that you can manipulate different genes and this can have a very significant impact on ageing. We know, for instance, that if you start manipulating DNA repair systems, in mice say, sometimes you get what looks like accelerated ageing. On the other hand, you can turn off a single gene in mice, like growth hormone receptor, and increase lifespan by 40%. Manipulating the system There are also interventions that modulate ageing. The most famous of them all is caloric restriction. Restricting the amount of calories animals eat (while maintaining essential nutrients like vitamins or minerals to keep them healthy) has been known for decades to expand lifespan in rodents by as much as 50%. And they’re also able to stay healthier for longer. It’s one of the things that we’re looking at in our lab, because if you know of a gene that mediates the affects of caloric restriction, then it may be a suitable target for drugs that have the same effects of caloric restriction but without you having to go on a diet – which most people don’t want to do. We do a mixture of bio-informatics and experimental work. We try to look for common patterns among genes to identify new genes that modulate longevity, and ones that regulate other genes. The thing to remember about our ageing in general is that it’s very time-consuming and expensive to do experiments. This is one of the problems of ageing research. But it has been calculated that slowing down the process of ageing by just seven years could cut in half the instances of age-related diseases at every single age. This would have a massive impact on the human lifespan, and on human health. I generally make the analogy of the Wright brothers, who built and flew the world’s first successful aircraft. They used to look at birds and say these birds are heavier than air and they can fly. If birds can fly, we can make aeroplanes. There is no law of nature that says ageing is immutable. On the contrary we know now that ageing is surprisingly plastic in the sense that it can be manipulated by genes, it can be manipulated by evolution and it can be manipulated by diet.

Enter sites like 420 Singles, which connects "420 friendly dating for singles who enjoy the freedom and benefits of Cannabis and or support it's legalization" and currently boasts around 23,000 members across the country, mostly on the West Coast. The site allows users to list how often they smoke and what kind of weed they prefer, helping them find other users with similar tastes. And 420 Singles is not even the only weed-friendly dating site around. A similar site, called my420mate.com, launched this spring and has around 6,200 members already.

                                Sierra Leone's 6 million residents have been confined to their homes over the last three days as part of a nationwide lockdown aimed at stopping the spread of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> across the country. Volunteers circulated throughout towns across the disease-ravaged country to educate households, quarantine the sick and remove the dead in what Reuters calls "one of the most extreme strategies employed since the epidemic began." Officials say the lockdown will likely be extended. "There is a very strong possibility it will be extended," Stephen Gaojia, head of the Sierra Leone's Emergency Operations Centre told Reuters after meeting with President Ernest Bai Koroma. "Even though the exercise has been a huge success so far, it has not been concluded in some metropolitan cities like Freetown and Kenema." Reuters reports that 92 bodies had been recovered so far, and some 123 people had contacted authorities over concerns they may be infected with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>.

He had been on antiretroviral therapy for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> for 5 years, and his CD4 cell count was 234 cells per μL and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> RNA was 357 copies per mL. Fine needle aspiration of a lymph node suggested Hodgkin's lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry reagents were temporarily out of stock, as sometimes happens in Malawi. We started chemotherapy with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine while waiting for results of a confirmatory biopsy sample.

At an event hosted in New York this week by Solar City, CEO Lyndon Rive and chairman <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> announced that within five to 10 years every set of solar panels that Solar City installs will come with a battery pack to help deal with the intermittency of solar power—one of the key factors limiting its use. Musk says his company Tesla Motors will supply at least some of those batteries.
