                                The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, was evacuated on Saturday in response to intense insurgent fighting, according to the State Department.  A Marine quick reaction force led the evacuation with assistance from two USMC MV-22 Ospreys, three Air Force F-16 fighter jets, and an undisclosed number of surveillance <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, according to the Military Times.   In situations like these, the Marine Corps is trusted to quickly respond to hostile situations, and countless hours of training have made it more than capable. In response to crises, Marines are expected to be able to execute these types of missions within six hours. Seventy-eight evacuees were transported to the nearby country of Tunisia by a group of 80 Marines, according to the Military Times. All in all, the evacuation took five hours. The Pentagon released some photos of the Marine crisis reaction force out of Sigonella, Italy, which was tasked with evacuating the embassy in Tripoli. We paired these with other photos from a training video to show you how these operations are supposed to go down. This MV-22 Osprey prepares to take off in support of the Tripoli embassy evacuation. Ospreys function as both a transport plane and a tilt-rotor aircraft. This provides the Marine Corps with the capability to tactically insert Marines into multiple environments while covering more distance than traditional helicopters.  Marines board the aircraft with their gear and weapons in anticipation of the operation. The wide cargo area allows the Osprey to transport a large amount of gear as well as Marines.  The green lights allow others to see the rotors of the Osprey during takeoff and landing and are an essential part of operating during nighttime conditions. Once inside, Marines cram in and sit prepared in anticipation of the embassy evacuation. The Marines fly in using the long transport capabilities of the Osprey. At the embassy, Marines fast-rope out of the Osprey onto the roof to quickly provide defensive support and to locate and evacuate embassy personnel. Meanwhile, the Marine security guards stationed in the embassy protect the ambassador and secure or destroy classified materials. Marines use smoke to conceal their movement and make sure to remove and secure the American flag immediately.  Once the Marines have located the embassy personnel, they quickly leave. A well-executed mission means providing security and getting in and out as quickly as possible. Here you can watch the Marines explain how they conduct an embassy evacuation and their role as America's emergency response force: <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: The 12 Best Books The Marine Corps Wants Its Leaders To Read Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                As the dog days of summer drag on, it's the perfect time for anyone who hasn't yet had the pleasure to curl up in an air-conditioned living room and dive into the greatest show currently on TV: "Top Gear."  Hosted by the charismatic trio of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, "Top Gear's" unorthodox and irreverent approach to automotive journalism has made it popular with fans and critics worldwide. Since its inception in 1977 as an automotive news magazine and the show's 2002 reboot into the current format, "Top Gear" has become a British television institution.  In fact, the BBC-produced, Emmy Award winning car show can be seen in over 200 countries around the world. It's easily accessible to a U.S. audience: seasons 2-20 are available on Netflix right now! Here's why "Top Gear" is can't-miss TV, even if you aren't a car nut or addicted to that veddy British sense of humor: 1. "Top Gear's" storytelling method gives it universal appeal. New viewers to "Top Gear" shouldn't mistake it for a run-of-the-mill car show. Because it isn't one.  At its core, the show aims to be informative, but does so with a unique blend of hyperbolic comedy, action, and drama that crosses the boundaries of age, gender, and culture. According to CBS's 60 Minutes, "Top Gear's" unique storytelling method and irreverent attitude helped the show generate 350 million viewers a week worldwide, as well as a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most-watched "factual" TV program. When asked by 60 Minutes to explain the show's appeal, "Top Gear" executive producer Andy Wilman joked, "It's a journey into the male mind, which I believe, is a really, potentially, very funny place — 'cause, let's face it, nothing happens there."  He's right — but 40% of "Top Gear's" audience is actually female! In fact, the show's near-universal appeal has helped turn it into a $1.5 billion brand, with spinoff series in Russia, Australia, South Korea, and the United States. 2. The show's 3 hosts have the greatest on-camera chemistry in TV. Even though "Top Gear" has spawned an American version on the History Channel, what makes the original the most fun is the inimitable chemistry between the show's trio of hosts. In fact, the program is propelled as much by their sometimes caustic camaraderie as it is by cars. One of the highlights of the show is the constant personality clash between the pedantic James May (nicknamed "Captain Slow" because he favors a non-thrashy driving style) and the bombastic Jeremy Clarkson (who doesn't really have a nickname). 3. Richard Hammond was nearly killed in a jet car crash during filming and didn't miss an episode. In 2006, Richard Hammond was nearly killed when the right-front tire of the Vampire jet car he was driving burst at nearly 300 mph, leading to a catastrophic crash. The accident, which caused the host to suffer memory loss and brain damage, had safety activists calling for the show's cancelation. Fortunately, Hammond, known on the show as "The Hamster" due to his diminutive stature, returned to show just three months later without missing a single episode. 4. Due to the "unique" way the BBC is funded, "Top Gear" is able to be brutally honest. Unlike most American network shows, the BBC and "Top Gear" are funded by British taxpayers, which means the hosts can pretty much say or do whatever they want without fear of retribution from sponsors. In fact, when Jay Leno turned down NBC's American spinoff of Top Gear, the comedian cited the potential influence of sponsors on the opinions expressed in the show as a main reason for his decision.  5. The "Clarkson Effect" is real, and car companies hate it. Jeremy Clarkson has long been a popular automotive journalist in the UK, but "Top Gear" has catapulted his influence into the stratosphere. In what has become known as the "Clarkson Effect," a positive or negative review from the host can make or break a product. When MG Rover entered bankruptcy in 2005, many at the automaker's Longbridge factory blamed Clarkson's negative reviews for torpedoing the company's sales. In 2011, Tesla sued "Top Gear" unsuccessfully for libel after Clarkson's exceedingly negative review of the company's Roadster caused panic among investors and led a few customers to cancelled their preorders. When asked by the BBC News about Clarkson, Tesla CEO <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> replied, "He can be very funny and irreverent, but he does have a bias against electric cars. His two pet peeves are American cars and electric cars, and we're an American electric car."  6. "Top Gear" has an awesome mascot called "The Stig." One of "Top Gear's" most popular characters is the show's unofficial mascot and mysterious resident professional test driver. Producers created the mute, helmet-clad character because they needed an adequately skillful driver to navigate the show's test track, located at a former air force base. The BBC has gone to great lengths to keep the true identity of the Stig a secret, even resorting to legal action to prevent the release of the information.  7. The hosts drove to the North Pole, through the Bolivian Jungle, and the plains of Central Africa. "Top Gear" takes its style of automotive journalism to the extreme via over-the-top globetrotting adventures. Instead of simply telling viewers whether a car is good or bad, the show will also subject vehicles to extreme real-world conditions. In 2007, Clarkson and May became the first people to drive to the North Pole, when the pair piloted a modified Toyota Hilux truck through the Arctic.  8. It features some of the most beautiful cinematography ever seen on the small screen. "Top Gear's" groundbreaking use of camera filters and cinematic wizardry has completely changed the way car shows are presented. 9. Then there are hilarious celebrity appearances.  Nearly every episode features a segment called "A Star In a Reasonably Priced Car," in which a celebrity is asked to tackle the "Top Gear" test track in an underpowered economy car. The result is a series of very entertaining sequences showing off each celebrity's driving prowess — or in many cases, lack thereof.   10. Top Gear even has a live stadium show. "Top Gear's" hosts have enhanced their rock-star status by going on a live stadium tour, complete with pyrotechnics, car stunts, and comedic gags. So far, "Top Gear" live has made its way through 24 counties. Sadly, it does not seem the live action show will come be coming to America any time soon.  <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: Watch A Dreamliner Maneuver Like A Stunt Plane DON'T FORGET: Follow Business Insider On Facebook Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                It’s hard to imagine a world in which our smartphones are faster than they already are today.  You can already reach for your phone, ask Google a question, and receive the answer within seconds. The forthcoming generation of wireless technology will be even faster, but it's not just about sheer speed. The next major network upgrade will solve one of the most aggravating problems we experience today — searching for a reliable, fast connection. The primary goal with 5G is to make it feel like the end user is always connected, regardless of whether or not you're inside or outside, near a window or buried in a basement. Part of the reason we'll need such strong connectivity is because 5G will be about powering much more than just smartphones — it'll be designed to connect smart watches, fitness bands, and smart household gadgets like the Nest Learning Thermostat among others. First, what is 5G? The term 5G refers to the true next generation of wireless networks. Since 4G rolled on a widespread scale over the past few years, we’ve seen numerous advancements, including LTE, LTE Advanced, and Verizon’s XLTE, which essentially means the carrier is using more bandwidth. All of these improvements build on the same core requirements and are categorized under the 4G umbrella. But 5G will be the real successor to 4G, and it will be founded on a different set of requirements than today’s existing network technology. It’s important to understand the differences between these networks because your phone’s performance greatly depends on the type of network you’re connected to. It’s more than just a little symbol that sits in the upper right-hand corner of your phone. The jump from 3G to 4G represented a massive improvement in high-speed downloads. It would be nearly impossible to use a service like Netflix with a 3G connection, which is one example of why 4G-level speeds became necessary for consumers within the past few years. So what will 5G bring, and what will we need it for in the future? Those questions are hard to address at this stage since it’s so early, but industry analysts are already making projections.  Speed isn’t the most important thing There’s a common misconception that 5G simply means super fast data speeds. That’s because the early testing we've seen so far has emphasized how much faster 5G will be than today's existing technology.  Last May, Samsung claimed that its upcoming 5G technology will be able to transfer more than 1 gigabit of data per second, as MIT Technology Review reported. To put that in perspective, a relatively speedy LTE connection today transfers data at about 60 megabits per second, which translates to roughly 0.05 gigabits. A gigabit connection is much faster than any data speeds you've experienced with your smartphone yet. Google claims that even at a rate of one gigabit per second, you can download a full HD movie in less than two minutes. Next-generation wireless networks will certainly be faster than our connections today, but that’s the least important priority for 5G, says Tod Sizer, vice president of the Wireless Research Program at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs. “If you say speed is the real thing we need to improve in 5G, you’re missing the point,” Sizer told Business Insider in an interview. “The end user doesn’t really care about speed. They care about what the application [they’re using] needs.” One of the biggest improvements we’ll see in 5G is the flexibility to support many different types of devices. In addition to connecting to phones and tablets, 5G will need to support wearable devices like fitness trackers and smart watches, smart-home gadgets like the Nest Learning Thermostat, and all sorts of sensors. “Being able to support a hundred-thousand machines in a given area is what we’re designing for today,” Sizer said. “We do believe that in the future every person will have 10 to 100 machines they need to work for them.” "In the future every person will have 10 to 100 machines they need to work for them.” That’s part of why it’s so hard to confirm the requirements for what type of technology will go into 5G. It’s hard to figure out the data capacity necessary to power all of these devices. “[It’s] not just in terms of supporting more data, but in terms of supporting more usage,” Peter Jarich, vice president, consumer and infrastructure at Current Analysis, told Business Insider. “And that becomes the real challenge. That’s an answer we don’t know yet, what capacity is needed.” Improving end-to-end performance will be another big focus when it come to 5G, Sizer said. End-to-end performance refers to how well the cellular radio in your smartphone can maintain connections with the servers it retrieves information from. Poor end-to-end performance isn’t very noticeable while you’re sending a text message or viewing a web page, but it can be really shows when you’re making a video call through Skype or watching Netflix, Sizer said. If you experience latency and lag when streaming video, it’s likely due to a weak end-to-end connection. Sizer said that this next generation cellular network will also usher in significant battery life enhancements for smartphones and mobile devices. According to Sizer, there are a lot of small tasks that applications need to run properly. For example, an email application sends a bunch of tiny requests back and forth from the host service’s servers to check for new emails. These requests, although small, end up chipping away at your phone’s battery life over time. Part of what Sizer’s team is researching at Bell Labs involves finding a better way to handle these requests. “There are a lot of applications that have all these little messages,” Sizer said. “If I can take care of these little messages, I can dramatically improve the life of tablets.” Don’t expect to see 5G for another 10 years Part of the reason it’s difficult to understand exactly what 5G will offer is because it hasn’t even been defined. The International Telecommunication Union hasn’t revealed the specific requirements and the types of technology that will be incorporated into 5G just yet. Nailing down the correct specifications and setting up infrastructure to deploy these networks is a slow, gradual process, Jarich explained. The task involves defining the requirements for 5G and the technology that goes into meeting those requirements, such as achieving a certain speed benchmark and deciding which components and antennas should be added to smartphones to meet those benchmarks. It typically takes 10 years to get a next-generation network up-and-running. Sizer and Jarich say that initial 5G deployment will probably start in 2020, and we’ll see widespread adoption by 2025. “In order to deploy a wireless network it requires a massive investment of money and effort,” Sizer said. “It takes time to recoup that investment, which is usually several billion dollars or euros for wireless networks.” Earlier this year, Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported that South Korea would invest $1.49 billion into building a 5G network for the country. At the end of 2013, the European Commission kicked off a partnership that would involve the European Union investing $963 million in 5G research. It usually requires billions of dollars to get a new wireless network fully deployed, and the cost of building 5G shouldn’t be any different than years past, Sizer said. Back in 2012, AT&T invested $14 billion to expand its LTE footprint to 300 million people by the end of 2014. That's $14 billion one carrier spent building up LTE over the course of three years — imagine how much each carrier could spend creating 5G networks over a span of 10 years. Both Sizer and Jarich agree that the ultimate goal of 5G is to make it feel like you’re never without an internet connection, whether you’re underground or in a remote area. But that doesn't mean wired broadband will become obsolete just yet, Jarich said. There simply isn't enough spectrum available to handle internet traffic without some help from wired connections. But 5G will do its best to try.  “Those people who were born in the year 2000, they’ve never known a world where they had to share a phone with their sister, where they couldn’t get access to any information they wanted simply by reaching into their pocket,” Sizer said. “And so it’s for these folks who have never known a world where they weren’t always connected, that we’re designing the next generation.” <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: Researchers Are Testing A 'Wonder Material' That Could Make Your Smartphone Better Than Ever Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                Targets, students of management agree, help achieve goals. The best are demanding but realistic. And that is something those in charge of the fight against <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> have come to realise. Their latest target, by far their most ambitious, is to end the epidemic by 2030. "End" is an elastic term, since there is no cure for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection, nor is one in sight. But optimists think a combination of the tools available--particularly the antiretroviral (ARV) drugs which now keep around 13m people alive--could be enough to stop the virus spreading. In the parlance of epidemiologists, they believe they can arrive at R{-0} That would be a stunning achievement. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> was unknown to science a mere 33 years ago. A combination of scientific research and political willpower has got the virus on the run. According to calculations by UN<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, the United Nations agency created to deal with the disease, 1.5m people died of it last year. That is down from a peak of 2.4m in 2005 (see chart). The rate of new infections has been falling for longer. To arrive at a point in 2030 where the rate of new infections is negligible is an ambitious aim, but not a foolish one. The tools to achieve it exist, and those at the 20th International <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> Conference, held this week in Melbourne, are sharpening them. Sadly, though, six delegates on their way to the conference were killed when flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17th. One of those delegates was Joep Lange, a former president of the International <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> Society (see "Obituary: Joep Lange"). But their work goes on. Transmission Break As Salim Abdool Karim, head of the Centre for the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> Programme of Research, in South Africa, told delegates, many ways are now available to prevent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>'s transmission--from counselling and condoms to drugs and circumcision (which cuts away a piece of the penis called the foreskin that is rich in cells susceptible to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection). One of the most effective of these is, fortuitously, a side-effect of ARV treatment. This reduces the level of the virus in people's bodies so much that it stops them infecting others, a phenomenon known as "treatment as prevention". A study published three years ago showed that treatment as prevention works--at least in the case of cohabiting couples where only one partner is infected. The likelihood of passing on the virus in these circumstances was reduced by 96%. How effective treatment as prevention is in the rough and tumble of wider human life was not so clear at that time, but research published earlier this year by a group at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, in South Africa, shows that uninfected people living in areas where 30-40% of those infected are on ARVs are 38% less likely to succumb than those in places where ARV coverage is less than 10%. Drugs are also emerging as a way for those who think they are at risk to protect themselves. Such "pre-exposure prophylaxis" has been talked of for a long time. It is now actually happening, thanks to the discovery that a medicine called Truvada (a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine) can be used this way. Robert Grant of the University of California, San Francisco, who led the original trial of Truvada's prophylactic powers, told the meeting of follow-up research at 11 sites on four continents. His new study, like his original one, looked mainly at gay men. It confirmed that Truvada does indeed reduce the risk of infection by about 90% and, crucially, that it is not necessary to take it every day. Four times a week will suffice, so the forgetful are not at risk, as was once feared. That matters, because many gay activists were suspicious that people might take Truvada insufficiently regularly and, at the same time, scale back on other precautions, thus exposing themselves to risk. As a consequence, uptake of the medicine had been low. Now it may increase. Using a pre-exposure prophylaxis clearly makes sense for the individuals involved and, if widely adopted, would help curb the epidemic. The World Health Organisation estimates that its widespread use by gay men might avert 1m infections over a decade. If heterosexuals adopted it too, that figure could be much larger. But Truvada is expensive (about $1,300 for a month's course), and even were it cheap, it is not clear how many people actually would use it. Tools to make a big dent in the epidemic thus exist. But, as the example of Truvada shows, they are not free--and many fear that politicians' eyes are wandering from <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> to other things. The Post-2015 Development Agenda, intended to follow on from the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals, which were set in 2000 and which explicitly mention <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> as a problem to be dealt with, do not, at the moment, mention the disease directly. This worries many. Spending on prevention and treatment, about $19 billion a year in a combination of locally raised money and foreign aid, is thought unlikely to rise over the next few years. Those fighting <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> must learn to do more with less. One watchword here is granularity. The world's <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> maps, which once recorded rates only on a country-by-country basis, now do so region by region. This means effort can be focused on the worst-affected places within a country, not just on the worst-affected countries. Deborah Birx, America's global <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> co-ordinator, thinks such focus is essential. It will, she believes, keep downward pressure on the infection rate without too much extra expense. A study published in the Lancet on July 19th, to coincide with the conference, supports her in this. Sarah-Jane Anderson of Imperial College London and her colleagues have crunched the numbers for Kenya and concluded that focusing on the worst-affected parts of that country could, over 15 years, reduce the number of new infections by 100,000 at no extra cost. Going With The Grain Granularity also applies to people. Researchers have long known that gay men, prostitutes and those who inject themselves with drugs are at higher risk than others, and sensible governments have taken this into account when designing their policies. Another set of papers in the latest Lancet excoriate those who do not--particularly those who persecute prostitutes. The authors suggest decriminalising prostitution could avert a third of the infections that would otherwise happen to prostitutes and their customers. But even within the wider population, some people are more at risk than others, and what is going on here is not always clear. In KwaZulu-Natal, for example, the rate of infection in boys at, or just out of school, rises slowly only as they get older, from 1% in those under 15 to 1.8% in those over 20. In girls, it rises from 2.6% to 24.7%. Dr Karim's group has tried to find out what is going on by sequencing the virus in infected pupils in a group of five schools, to see who might have passed it on to whom. The answer is that these teenagers are not catching it from each other: few pupils shared viral genotypes. The boys are not catching <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> at a huge rate anywhere. The girls, though, are--presumably from older, promiscuous (and therefore infected) men who are acting as "superspreaders". That had been suspected, for sugar daddies are common in South Africa. But viral genetics helps confirm the idea. In theory, they might identify the individuals involved, too--though that would require those people to make themselves available for sampling, which sounds unlikely. Even with all this attention to detail, though, some budgets will have to go up. A target of having 15m people on ARVs by 2015 was based on clinical guidelines which are now outdated. In 2013 the World Health Organisation decided that people would benefit from taking the drugs earlier in the course of their infections. This added more than 9m to the list. And even knowing whom to give the drugs to requires a lot of work. At the moment, UN<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> reckons 19m of the 35m estimated to be infected have not been identified. That means they cannot be treated and have no reason to modify their behaviour to avoid infecting other people. Moreover, none of these things, however successful, will truly end <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>. To do that would mean not just treating, but curing the 35m. Two years ago, at the 19th <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> conference, in Washington, DC, there was cautious hope that a cure might be possible. One reason was that a baby girl in the American state of Mississippi had, in a peculiar set of circumstances, been given ARV treatment immediately after birth but the treatment had then been interrupted. The Mississippi baby's mother was infected when she gave birth, but her doctors did not know in time to treat her, thereby eliminating the risk of her child picking up the virus at the bloody moment of parturition. The child's treatment was then interrupted 18 months later, when the mother moved out of the area. When doctors re-established contact, they found that the child seemed virus-free. If true, she would, in effect, have been cured. They therefore did not give her drugs again, and instead monitored her closely. Sadly, it emerged earlier this month that, 27 months after she had stopped receiving the drugs, the virus had returned. Studies are nevertheless going on to find out if giving ARVs to adults immediately after infection might stop <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> getting a grip. Dr Lange was setting one up. Even if this approach works, it will be of little use to the 35m already infected. Here, the cupboard looks bare. Another isolated individual, the "Berlin patient" Timothy Brown, has apparently been cured by the drastic step of replacing his bone marrow with a transplant from someone genetically immune to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection. (Mr Brown also had leukaemia; hence the operation.) But that is not an option for most people. The idea of using genetic engineering to create a similar immunity in laboratory-bred <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stem cells">stem cells</a></span> of the sort that give rise to the cells <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infects, and then transplanting the result into people, is being investigated. So is the development of drugs which would flush <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> from the places where it hides from the ARVs intended to destroy it. A preliminary result suggesting such flushing might be possible was announced at the conference, but that is a long, long way from an effective medicine. With luck, one of these options will come good. But until then, the best advice for those infected with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> is: keep on taking the tablets.

                                A model of the bubonic plague bacterium, which is known as Yersina pestis. Tim Evanson/Flcikr, CC BY-SA Cases of plague have been reported in the Chinese city of Yumen, where a man has died of the disease. Control measures taken by the authorities include travel restrictions in and out of the city, and 151 people being reportedly put under quarantine. Plague has been responsible for hundreds of millions of deaths in three devastating pandemics, including the Black Death (1346–53). Despite being readily treatable with antibiotics, infections and deaths continue to occur throughout the world. What is plague? Plague is a serious disease caused by the bacteria Yersina pestis, which is transmitted from infected animals to humans by fleas. There are a number of different clinical forms – bubonic plague and pneumonic plague being the most important. Rats have historically been the biggest spreaders of the plague. Jean-Jacques Boujot/Flickr, CC BY-SA Bubonic plague is named after the presence of buboes, or infected lymph nodes. These develop after an incubation period of two to six days after bites from infected fleas. Bacteria then drain to local lymph nodes in the groin, under the arm or in the neck, which become swollen and painful. If untreated, infection spreads to the bloodstream and other internal organs. Pneumonic plague occurs when the lungs are involved and has a much more rapid course. It leads to the build up of pus and fluid in the lungs, followed by bleeding. This severe form of plague, although less common than the bubonic form, is particularly significant because bacteria in the sputum can spread the disease to other people. A number of common, inexpensive antibiotics, including gentamicin and doxycycline, are effective against plague. But the effectiveness of treatment depends on antibiotics being given early, before severe infection is established. Plague doctors in the 17th century wore protective clothing with nosegays concealed in their masks and carried pomander canes. Wikimedia Commons, CC BY Fortunately, antibiotic resistance does not appear to be common, despite a concerning 1995 report that described a multi-drug resistant strain. Like many infectious diseases that cause outbreaks, plague is a zoonosis, meaning that it normally occurs in animals, with humans becoming involved as a spillover phenomenon. Yersinia pestis is found in a number of animals – most importantly rats, but also in a range of other mammals and is transmitted to humans via fleas. In modern times, most cases of plague occur in African countries, particularly Madagascar. Pandemics There have been three major pandemics of plague described throughout history, the most famous being the Black Death in the 14th century. Both the bubonic and pneumonic forms spread quickly through crowded, unsanitary cities and were carried by rats between urban centres. It’s been estimated that a third to a half of all people in affected regions died. This event is thought to have left its mark on human genetic makeup, as an example of natural selection. Genetic studies have found a higher prevalence of changes (the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CCR5">CCR5</a></span>-delta 32 mutation) in affected regions that are thought to provide relative protection against plague (although others argue that different diseases may be involved). Ironically, this mutation is also thought to provide protection against a very different modern plague, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>. AAPIMAGE Pandemics of plague also had a profound influence on religion and culture. Contrary to popular opinion, the nursery rhyme “Ring a ring o' roses” probably does not describe pneumonic plague. But the extreme responses of humanity in horrific circumstances has provided a rich vein to mine for generations of writers, including Daniel Defoe and Samuel Pepys, Albert Camus and more recently, Geraldine Brooks. DNA studies from plague victims have been able to confirm that plague was the cause of the Black Death as well as the earlier Plague of Justinian(AD 541-542). Genetic studies of the causative organism Y. pestis suggest that there are no particular bacterial factors present in pandemic strains. This suggests that, given the right environmental conditions, all strains of bacteria are probably equally likely to cause outbreaks. Quarantine and plague The practice of quarantine, or restriction of the movement of people to prevent the spread of disease, was first employed in the 1370s in Dubrovnik, and later in 1423 in Venice during plague outbreaks. The word itself comes the word quaranta (Italian for “40") referring to the number of days for which travellers were isolated. The isolation of whole villages or cities, as has been reported in the current Chinese outbreak, is termed cordon sanitaire. This practice also dates back to medieval times, most famously in the English village of Eyam which voluntarily adopted this policy in 1665.

Fiona in Eden/Flickr, CC BY-NC Plague control programs involve educating the population on measures to improve sanitation to reduce exposure to rats and fleas; other rat and flea control measures, particularly on ships and around warehouses; and surveillance of infection in rats. Case identification and treatment in humans also provides an effective method of control by preventing ongoing spread. A number of vaccines have been developed, but are not widely available in most countries due to concerns about their lack of effectiveness. Plague is an example of how bacteria, animals, humans and the environment interact together to produce the conditions that enable infections to occur. Although we may never see outbreaks on the scale of the Black Death again, the ongoing reports of cases remind us that improvements in basic sanitation are still needed in many parts of the world Allen Cheng receives funding from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.

                                Are recent revelations a game-changer for Tor?Shutterstock hacker silhouette Have the UK police successfully broken anonymity on the internet? They certainly seemed to imply as much when the National Crime Agency proudly announced last week that it had made 660 arrests after an operation to identify people viewing indecent images of children online. The announcement raises questions about just how anonymous it is possible to be online, particularly in the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dark net">dark net</a></span> and through systems like Tor, which is used by criminals, but also many others with legitimate reasons for wanting to remain anonymous such as journalists, whistleblowers, and political activists under repressive regimes. We should also treat the NCA bust with some scepticism, given its very convenient political timing. Operation Notarise When the National Crime Agency made its big announcement about Operation Notarise, it was obviously good news. Hundreds of people suspected of crimes could soon be under lock and key thanks to its efforts. The agency also said that it would not reveal how it identified the suspects so that it could use the same method to track them down in the future. There was a clear message sent out to wrongdoers in the official press release, though: “We want those offenders to know that the internet is not a safe anonymous space for accessing indecent images, that they leave a digital footprint, and that law enforcement will find it”. It made a similar statement after arresting four people suspected of being involved in drug selling through now-defunct dark web marketplace Silk Road, warning that even the most tech-savvy criminals make mistakes and leave traces. The NCA is clearly saying that it can find you, even if you are using the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dark net">dark net</a></span>. And in the context of child porn, it would be reassuring if it were right. But it may also be the case that the security software currently available is so difficult to use that, in practice, anyone will indeed make mistakes. Others would say that the NCA has picked up only low-hanging fruit in its 660 arrests, identifying the dumb ones – the people who use anonymity tools inexpertly or maybe not at all. Breaking Tor In its infamous Tor Stinks document from June 2012, the NSA revealed that it does not believe in blanket attacks on Tor – even gathering and retaining all potential Tor traffic all the time would just not work. But targeted attacks, including in the imaginatively titled EPICFAIL programme, which seeks to capitalise on inexpert use of Tor to identify people, might be more successful. There are NSA and GCHQ programmes that look for cookies that survive Tor sessions (with the standard Tor browser bundle there shouldn’t be any). The most powerful attacks against Tor use the NSA QUANTUM programme. This, among other things, employs very fast servers in central locations on the internet backbone to intercept and replace “suspicious” internet communications. Other attacks against Tor have been known for a long time. Researchers showed in 2005, for example, that internet traffic analysis could be used to link different Tor connections, though this could not be used to directly identify the users involved. … for less than $3K? There was a flurry of internet excitement recently when researchers from Carnegie Mellon University revealed they would make a presentation at the 2014 Black Hat conference that showed you don’t have to be the NSA to break Tor. In fact, they would reveal, a large number of Tor users could be identified within a few months and on a budget of less than $3,000. Interestingly, Carnegie Mellon had the talk cancelled for legal reasons and the Tor development team are fixing the bug they identified. The story is unlikely to end here. It seems that the current state of play is that limited targeted attacks are possible, but blanket attacks are not. This could, of course, change with new developments as a lot of research is going on trying to devise new attacks against Tor. Surveillance, and timing The debate about whether Tor can be truly anonymous will rage on but it’s the timing of the NCA announcement that is perhaps most notable. Arrests had been made under Operation Notarise from at least April onwards but it chose not to say anything until July. The announcement finally came on July 16, the very day the UK parliament was to vote through the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers bill (“DRIP”) as emergency legislation. The public argument for the need for this bill was that “communications data of this kind are used in 95% of serious and organised crime investigations, counter terrorism investigations and online child abuse investigations”. The 95% figure seems to be based on communications data being used in serious and organised crime investigations by the Crown Prosecution Service. What is not clear is which fraction actually referred to data resulting from targeted rather than blanket surveillance, and in how many cases retention had played a role. Any successful attack against Tor anonymity would probably have been based on targeted surveillance and perhaps even on direct interference. This strongly suggests that the conveniently timed NCA success actually lends little evidence to support the need for blanket data retention powers as included in DRIP. All in all, it seems that this operation, with its very positive impact of putting hundreds of very dumb and dangerous criminals behind bars, has some shadows. Its convenient political timing should make us regard the whole thing with scepticism. Particularly when, like in this case, the authorities seem not to have used any new or powerful technology but mostly achieved an easy, timely and effortless media victory. On the other hand, it is probably not realistic to aim for much more with the modest resources that our law enforcement has at its disposal.

                                Facebook has made it very clear it’s no longer just a social network. It’s been working hard trying to compete with Google on several fronts: search, nascent technology markets, and post-desktop computing.  Now that the $2 billion Oculus deal is closed, Facebook can beef up its focus on that third part of the Google competition—creating a Glass killer. See Also: Why No One Trusts Facebook To Power The Future Glass is Google’s first foray into ambient computing that’s supposed to prevent users from getting lost in mobile devices or computer screens. The face computer appeals to the tech-obsessed, but Google’s hoping Glass will be as ubiquitous as smartphones in the future. Facebook’s first step comes in the form of virtual reality built for video games—but video games are not what Facebook wants Oculus for. Now that the $2 billion deal is closed, Facebook is working on another hardware partnership to make virtual reality and face computing a standard beyond the console. Facebook And Samsung, A Match Made In Mobile Facebook is partnering with Samsung to create a headset that uses mobile devices, like smartphones or tablets, to create a virtual reality, according to a report from CNET. Currently, Oculus hardware works with computers and game consoles—the idea being you put the goggles on and are transported to another reality, and you feel like part of whatever game you're playing. With Oculus software on Samsung mobile devices, the idea of virtual reality can expand even further, and beyond the constraints of the $350 Oculus Rifts.  A Facebook partnership makes sense for Samsung. The South Korean tech company has been moving away from Google's Android operating system—including ditching Android in its new Gear 2 smartwatches, the other wearable the company is trying to pioneer. Early screenshots leaked by Samsung industry blog SamMobile, show Samsung’s new Gear VR mobile software that manages what appears to be a Samsung VR headset. Though there’s not much users can do without the actual hardware itself, if the screenshots are correct, this could be a first look at a potential Oculus-powered partnership with Facebook. The idea of a smartphone-based hardware headset match isn't entirely new. In fact, at Google I/O earlier this year, the company playfully mocked the VR headset, distributing Cardboard, a puzzle-like product that lets users create their own thrifty head-mounted hardware. Playing The Long Game Facebook and Google aren’t focused on the present. They’re both betting big on future technologies that have yet to bear fruit. Everything they do right now is what they expect in the next five to 10 years, virtual reality and computing without mobile or computer screens clearly playing a large part of the way digital consumption is changing.  <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Drones">Drones</a></span>, VR and robots are more than vanity projects—they're the technologies we'll be using to power and consume the Internet.  Competition between the two firms is clearly heating up. What was initially seen as a way for Facebook to buy cool may actually be the company's way of laying the foundation for a future in which we talk with our friends through face computers.  Lead image by Adriana Lee for ReadWrite.

                                Many people infected have had no contact with camels or other animals.Al Jazeera English/Flickr, CC BY-SA The <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Middle East respiratory syndrome">Middle East respiratory syndrome</a></span> <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus">coronavirus</a></span> (<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span> Co-V) emerged in 2012 and has caused ongoing illness in the Middle East and more than 280 deaths. The public health response to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV has been modelled on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), a related virus which caused a pandemic more than ten years ago. But the features of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-Cov are very different, as I outline in a new study, published today in the journal Environment Systems and Decisions. And while camels have been attributed as the source of the outbreak, the peculiar patterns of the virus suggest we need to consider another possible source: deliberate release. Unusual pattern Many of the features are paradoxical and cannot be explained by known principles of disease transmission. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV caused outbreaks in hospitals, for example, with some human-to-human transmission. Yet <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV was present in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during several mass gatherings such as the Hajj pilgrimage, and did not result in an epidemic. We have shown that, under current assumptions about the virus, the probability of no epidemic arising after the Hajj in two consecutive years is extremely low. This shows the current assumptions about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV could be wrong. SARS was estimated to be more infectious than <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV, caused a classic epidemic of over 8,000 cases globally and was eliminated within eight months. In contrast, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV is less infectious, but has persisted for more than three times the duration of SARS. This is not the expected behaviour of a virus with low infectivity. Further, SARS caused satellite epidemics in countries to which it spread, whereas <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV has remained mainly in the Middle East, without sparking epidemics in other countries where cases have occurred. Cases which have occurred in other countries are mainly in travellers to the Middle East. Outbreaks of SARS in hospitals were caused by a single strain, but more than one strain of the virus has been identified in some outbreaks of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV. This means that affected people were exposed to several different viruses at around the same time. Where did these viruses come from? What was the source of infection to humans? It remains a mystery why this virus, which has low infectiousness has persisted for so long when a consistent source of infections has not been identified. Possible sources There is evidence that camels are the source of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV. But while a few infected people have had contact with camels, many have no known contact with camels or other animals; and some have no contact with infected humans or animals. The finding of the virus in camels does not exclude bioterrorism as a cause. A virus that has a trophism for particular animals, when present in an environment, will tend to infect those animals. It’s a case of which came first: the chicken or the egg. The other postulated explanation for the paradoxes of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV is that there are many mild or asymptomatic cases which have gone undetected. But attempts to look for such cases has not turned up high numbers of mild or asymptomatic cases. Whether this is the explanation will become clearer as better screening methods are developed. The features of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV do not suggest an epidemic disease, but rather, a sporadic pattern. This could be an animal source or deliberate release. My paper shows there is slightly more weight to deliberate release than an animal source, although both are possible. In the case of bioterrorism, if it is not considered at all, it can never be detected, unless it involves an eradicated pathogen such as smallpox. Public health does not have a good track record of correctly interpreting aberrant patterns. Take the 1984 Rajneesh cult salmonella attack in the United States, for example. Public health authorities did not consider the possibility of bioterrorism, despite a local politician arguing the case that it might be bioterrorism and despite the facts not fitting with ordinary food poisoning. If Rajneesh had not confessed later, the attack would have never been recognised, and even when he did confess, he wasn’t believed. This case illustrates normal human tendency to force available facts into common, comfortable explanations, rather than to view the facts objectively. Getting to the bottom of it The patterns of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV are unusual, and while an animal reservoir or undetected mild human cases as the source of ongoing human infections are both possible, bioterrorism is also possible. In the case of deliberate release, simulating nature would be difficult with a sporadic infection, and this may explain the observed discrepancies in the epidemiology. Whatever the source of persistent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MERS">MERS</a></span>-CoV infections, using a framework based on SARS to tackle this infection is a mistake, because it is very different to SARS.

                                We have stalked the human immunodeficiency virus from every direction science suggested. Flickr: Brian Talbot, CC BY-NC The future of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatment bears no resemblance to its past. Through the lonely days of the early single-drug treatment AZT to the arrival of combination therapy in 1996, and the new generation of fixed-dose therapies (one pill containing three or more drugs, taken once a day) of more recent times, we have focused on attacking the virus. Spurred on by people who developed resistance after taking the only available early options, we have stalked the human immunodeficiency virus (<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>) from every direction science suggested. But the distinction between prevention and treatment blurred once we understood the preventive effect of antiretroviral therapy on transmission. The short- and medium-term future is less about developing more treatments than how we deploy them. A targeted approach One possibility is to treat every person with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>, regardless of stage of infection. The rationale for this approach is that it will help the individual’s health as well as prevent transmission. The recent arrival of reliable rapid testing should encourage more widespread testing and more immediate initiation of treatment in hard-to-reach participants. We have good drugs with minimal side effects and, if enough people take up treatment, it could theoretically stop the epidemic. But questions remain: does everyone need treatment for their individual health benefits if they are otherwise well? Should we not be more selective with our expensive drug cocktails and stay with the present threshold of a CD4 (white blood cells that fall dramatically in number in people who have <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>) count of 500, which is more likely to capture people with already impaired immune systems who are more at risk of illness? In concentrated epidemics, such as those in our region and in the west, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> presents consistently among members of defined groups including people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, and sex workers and their clients. Given this, testing the general population would be an immense waste of resources. For people with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> infection to benefit from treatment, they need to know they have the virus, have access to appropriate health care and be compliant with the treatment regimen. Australian data indicate that fewer than 60% of people living with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> have travelled the pathway from infection to diagnosis, to treatment through to viral suppression. A general community approach But there’s no doubt that we need to test more people more often. In generalised epidemics such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, where the infection is across the whole community and not isolated in distinct populations, treatment as prevention is particularly attractive, leading to calls for universal testing. A strategy of universal voluntary <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> testing for everyone over the age of 15, and the immediate provision of antiretroviral therapy for people who test positive, was shown in a mathematical model (based on data from South Africa) to be able to reduce <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> prevalence to 1% within 50 years. This aspirational but costly approach is attractive. We have good evidence from Ethiopia and Malawi, for example, where the epidemic is already showing signs of declining incidence in the face of widespread uptake of treatment. The general community approach has the additional virtue of dampening the stigma and discrimination that can occur when the epidemic is concentrated in key affected groups. Toward a cure About 33 million people are living with <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> worldwide, most of them in lower- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) goal of 15 million people in treatment by 2015 is unlikely to be reached (the present figure is 10 million). International donor resources for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> therapy, largely from the US PEPFAR program and the Global Fund to Fight <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, Tuberculosis and Malaria, appear to have peaked with little sign of alternative sources. Realistically, we would need to double or triple the present aid levels to achieve universal treatment. But at a time of overt donor fatigue and moves to transition the cost of continued <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatment to each country, this is not very likely. In the face of dwindling international aid, the provision of antiretroviral therapy seems unsustainable in the long term. For every two people established on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> treatments, at least five become infected. If we can’t dramatically escalate funding for a massive roll-out in the short term, then the long-term future must lie in accelerated vaccine research and the development of the magic bullet: a cure. But what we all must remember is that the holy grail wasn’t found in the absence of significant resources for research. Professor Cooper was appointed inaugural director of the National Centre in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> Epidemiology and Clinical Research, established in response to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> epidemic by the Federal Government in 1986 as one of three national <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> research centres (the others were in virology and social research). The National Centre in <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> Epidemiology and Clinical Research was renamed The Kirby Institute in 2011 in recognition of its increasingly wide brief in blood-borne viruses, sexually transmissible diseases, and other infectious diseases.

The Australian market, that is. Ansell, the Australian prophylactic company, will manufacture a condom laced with the antimicrobial VivaGel lubricant. Australia's version of the Food and Drug Administration, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, gave the product a Conformity Assessment Certification, meaning that it could be on the market within months. The gel is proven effective in killing 99.9% of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

                                AT FIRST glance it would appear that China has gone online, and gone digital, with great gusto. The spectacular rise of internet stars such as Alibaba, Tencent and JD would certainly suggest so. The country now has more smartphone users and households with internet access than any other. Its e-commerce industry, which turned over $300 billion last year, is the world’s biggest. The forthcoming stockmarket flotation of Alibaba may be the largest yet seen.So it is perhaps surprising to hear it argued that much of Chinese business has still not plugged in to the internet and to related trends such as cloud computing and “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” analysis; and therefore that these technologies’ biggest impact on the country’s economy is still to come. That is the conclusion of a report published on July 24th by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), a think-tank run by the eponymous consulting firm. It finds that only one-fifth of Chinese firms are using cloud-based data storage and processing power, for example, compared with three-fifths of American ones. Chinese businesses spend only 2% of their revenues on information technology, half the global average. Even the biggest, most...

                                Laced with disease-causing bacteria.EPA More than two-thirds of chicken produced in the UK is contaminated with disease-causing bacteria, an investigation by The Guardian has revealed. Although the bug can be killed by proper cooking, it is estimated more than 300,000 people in the UK get diarrhoea from this bug every year. More than 100 people die as a consequence, and many more developing long term neurological and gastrointestinal problems. Despite the burden of disease caused by the bacteria called <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> jejuni, it has remained “under the radar”, unlike the scares caused by bacteria such as Salmonella and Listeria in the 1980s and 1990s. The problem of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> is on the top of the agenda for poultry producers and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and a major concern for our major retailers, but The Guardian believes that not enough is being done. The intensive nature of production, transport, slaughter and processing gives the bug many opportunities to spread through flocks and between carcasses. In a large chicken processing plant, 200,000 animals may be slaughtered and butchered each day. If the first flock on the line that day has <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> infection, then there is a good chance that many of the whole birds or chicken portions leaving the plant that day will be contaminated. Good hygiene, cleaning and following the correct procedures are vital in reducing these risks, but it would seem corners are being cut and errors are being made that impact directly on food safety. How can the spread be controlled <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> jejuni is in your chicken. De Wood, Pooley, USDA, ARS, EMU., CC BY Spread of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> is difficult to control in chicken production. Usually the bug survives in vast numbers in chickens' intestines. Although it can occasionally make chickens ill, it is normally carried with no observable effect on the bird. The bug also spreads very quickly within a flock. It is not clear where <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> comes from, though the practice of “thinning” is the single largest risk of a flock becoming infected. The practice involves selling lighter chicken for early slaughter to avoid overstocking, whilst retaining the remainder for slaughter at a greater weight. The controls that have been successful in reducing Salmonella in chickens are less effective in reducing <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span>. There is also no vaccine available. Some methods of controls are under investigation by FSA and the poultry industry. These include blast chilling, lactic acid treatment and bacteriophage treatment, but they are costly and in most cases of questionable efficacy. Ultimately it is a difficult balance between providing cheap and nutritious food and maintaining food safety for an industry that operates on small margins. There is no specific legislation for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> control, such as there is for Salmonella control. Introducing any legislation will increase cost, which could push production overseas where chicken can be produced even more cheaply but where standards in hygiene and animal welfare are lower. Longer-term solutions Ultimately on-farm controls, such as vaccines or breeding of birds that are more resistant to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> infection, are likely to be more successful. However, these are some way off and need greater support from government and industry. The focus on quick solutions to meet FSA targets on reduction of carcass contamination has to an extent ignored long-term solutions. Another worry is that emerging variants of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> are more likely to leave the gut and contaminate the liver or muscle. This would make controls after slaughtering even less effective as they would be unable to penetrate into the organs. The question I am often asked is: “Do you eat chicken?” The answer is “yes … but I ensure that any chicken I eat is thoroughly cooked and I always practice good hygiene within the kitchen to avoid cross contamination”. At present this is the best, and perhaps, the only thing that can be done to reduce the risk of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a></span> infection.

                                EPA/Atel Safadi While there is violent disagreement about who is to blame for the unfolding catastrophe in Gaza, there is less argument about its consequences. A rapidly rising – primarily civilian – death toll is difficult enough to contemplate, let alone justify. Eventually the fighting will cease and talks will begin. The only question is how many women and children will be slaughtered between now and then. Things might have been different. When John Kerry was appointed as US Secretary of State, he nominated doing something about the ‘Palestinian question’ as one of his key foreign policy goals. Given how many of Kerry’s predecessors have tried in vain to address this problem, it always looked likely to prove a triumph of experience over hope. Even a passing familiarity with the historical record of American engagement in this part of the world should have given significant pause for thought. Ironically, at least part of the problems have been caused by the United States. It is not controversial to suggest that no other state exercises as much influence over American foreign policy as Israel. John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt’s important book may not have earned them many friends, but it did a valuable service in revealing just how powerful and influential the Jewish lobby is in the US. The possibility that any American president or Secretary of State will be able to deal even-handedly with the protagonists in this conflict is simply laughable. There are two crucial points to make about this. First, and most importantly, it is not anti-Semitic to point this out. Israel’s lobbyists have become highly skilled at shaping the dominant discourse in this area, and the stock response is to paint critics as closet anti-Semites. This is simply unjust and gets in the way of any reasoned debate about the issues. Israel’s policies should be treated and assessed in exactly the same way as any other state’s. Not to do so actually is racist. Second, the biased nature of American foreign policy is undermining its credibility and influence in the Middle East. While American standing in the world has recovered dramatically since the dark days of the Bush regime, the one exception is the Arab world, where only 30% of respondents have a favourable view of the US according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Centre. Soft power may be going out of fashion at present, but it still has its merits. It’s hard to persuade people to behave differently if they doubt your motives. The limits of hard power are even more apparent for those with eyes to see. All states may have the right to defend themselves, but if any population ought to know something about excessive force, brutality and persecution, it ought to be the people of Israel. Whatever the historical rights and wrongs of this conflict may be, killing innocent women and children is never a good look – even worse when they’re already in intensive care. It is a measure of how hopelessly destructive this struggle has become that both sides seem willing to wade through the blood of innocents in pursuit of their goals. Perhaps Hamas really is entirely cynical about the carnage being caused among its own people, but it is worth considering how such a cold-blooded calculus can be sustained and why so many young men have become its willing accomplices and victims. There is no surer recipe for social disruption than lots of angry young men with no jobs, status, future or stake in a functioning society and economy. Mix in ethnic tensions and unresolved historical grudges and the preconditions for conflict are all too evident. But when these are played out with the confines of the Gaza strip it is a recipe for a pocket-sized apocalypse. Gaza and Perth (where I am fortunate enough to live) have one thing in common: they both have populations of a bit more than 1.5 million. Gaza’s population is packed into 365 sq kms; Perth’s enjoys about 2500 sq kms. Living in Gaza would be hellish enough at the best of times. Living there under constant bombardment would be enough to induce despair. The idea that people could seek safety in such circumstances is simply risible. There are plainly no easy or obvious answers to what is one of the most intractable problems on earth. Outside powers can, however, treat both sides equally. This means that the US, and Australia for that matter, cannot give unqualified, uncritical and unending support to one side. Even friends can behave badly at times. Letting other countries know when they have crossed the line of acceptable behaviour might be in everyone’s interest. When the UN suggests that Israel may have committed war crimes, clearly something has gone badly wrong. The Palestinians may be suffering most directly, but Israel’s bone-headed, intransigent insistence on using its vastly superior military force to try and solve what is ultimately a political problem can do it no good either.

Fighting <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> in real life, of course, is nowhere near that easy. But new research from scientists at Temple University just took a step in that direction. The research team found a way to essentially "edit" <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> out of DNA. By using RNA that rewrites genetic code, the researchers were able to cut out the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> from infected cells. The background: <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> works by attaching itself to specific cells — T-cells or CD4 cells — that allow it to replicate itself and spread throughout the body. The virus integrates itself into those cells, writing itself into an infected person's genome. While antiretroviral drugs can hold off the process, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> is still integrated into those cells. The virus is there for good, which is part of the reason that finding a cure seems almost impossible. That's where this research comes in. Read More

                                JUDGING from the condemnation, Facebook just “friended” Satan. The company has been pilloried for academic research it published, showing that by adjusting its users’ news feeds so that a greater proportion of positive or negative items appeared, it could nudge people to post slightly sunnier or gloomier items themselves. For sociologists, the study provided evidence of “social contagion”—the spread of ideas and moods through imitation and conformity—without face-to-face contact.That Facebook runs similar tests all the time for commercial reasons—to get users to linger longer, or to click on ads—was largely lost on the critics. And the most telling bit went unnoticed: the difference in posting behaviour was between 0.04% and 0.1%. It sounds paltry, and is. But to Facebook’s data scientists, it amounted to a smashing victory. “Given the massive scale,” they noted, “even small effects can have large aggregated consequences.”This may indeed be the unspoken secret of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>. The much-hyped term captures the idea that it has become possible to collect vastly more data than before, and to process it far more cheaply and quickly. The result, typically, is to...

                                THE star of the show was missing from the skies above the Farnborough air show, Europe’s biggest aerospace get-together, which began on July 14th. The F-35 fighter (pictured), which was to have made its first appearance outside America, is grounded after an engine fire. Not taking to the air when expected is a trait of Lockheed Martin’s jet. It is years behind schedule and stratospherically over budget. Its absence is an embarrassment for Lockheed but, then again, its presence might have reminded the defence officials shopping for kit at Farnborough of just the sort of complex and expensive programme that they want to avoid signing up to in future.Arms-makers are going through a lean period. Some big contracts, such as ones to make bombers, trainer aircraft and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>, are still up for grabs in America, the world’s biggest spender. But it and other rich-world governments, struggling to curb their deficits, are trying ever harder to get the most bang for the fewest bucks. The revenues of 17 of the top 20 American weapons-makers shrank in 2013. American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had helped to push global spending to a record $1.7 trillion in 2008. Since then...

                                FOR years the BRICS countries have insisted they are more than an acronym. To dispel any lingering doubts, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, who gathered in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza for their sixth annual summit on July 15th, announced the creation of two financial institutions: the New Development Bank (NDB) to finance infrastructure and “sustainable development” projects, with $50 billion in capital to start with, and the $100 billion Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), to tide over members in financial difficulties.On the surface, the NDB and the CRA, which must still be approved by the five countries’ parliaments, look like upstart rivals to the World Bank and the IMF, together the cornerstone of the post-war economic order. The BRICS complain that the Bretton Woods outfits, named after a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a></span> town where they were conceived 70 years ago this month, give the developing world short shrift. China, whose economy is second only to America’s, has fewer votes there than the Benelux countries. America and Europe have proved shamefully slow to redress the imbalance.Recipients of IMF cash also resent the tough reforms on which help is conditional, not to mention the lecturing tone in which they are dictated. In Fortaleza Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, extolled the NDB and CRA as a way to prevent the “harassment” of countries...
