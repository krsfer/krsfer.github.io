                                People and regions all around the world have their own unique phrases and slang that only they would understand, and the intelligence community comprised of spies, analysts, and cryptography specialists is no different. For people working in the shadows of the intelligence community, "illegal" holds a much different meaning than what most view as a violation of law. The same goes for "assets" or "eyewash." These are terms that shed light on the secret world of spycraft, and they help professionals at CIA, NSA, or intelligence services of the military to talk to each other in a common language and present information to decision-makers. The website Public Intelligence obtained an unclassified glossary of terms and definitions for counterintelligence professionals created by the Defense Department a couple months back. At 359 pages, it's a hefty read, so we pulled out some of the most interesting and unique terms here. "Asset" No, we're not talking about a stock. In intel-speak, an asset is anything that holds intelligence value. This can be technical — a hacked phone for example — or a human asset: A person working for a foreign intelligence agency who has agreed to share secrets a spy is looking for. "Asset validation" Not every source is going to be a meaningful one. Just as a journalist may test a source or press for other information to confirm what they are being told, an intelligence asset needs to be "validated" — meaning there is a process to make sure the asset is authentic, reliable, and useful. "Walk-in" While spies often have to go out and look for people to turn against their homeland and spill secrets, sometimes a potential asset just shows up at the embassy door. These are referred to as "walk-ins" or "volunteers" although they don't have to literally go to a location. Former CIA officer Aldrich Ames and former FBI agent Robert Hanssen were both "volunteers" to the Soviet KGB. "Backstop" This is an arrangement made to make sure a spy's cover isn't blown. It's the spy's version of an alibi if they were to be picked up by the bad guys. If a spy is inside Iran posing as a businessman, then his backstop would be documents, financial records, and a phone number back to his office that would vouch for him, as one example. "Cover within a cover" If the backstop may not hold up, a spy may revert to this "Inception"-like phrase. In going to their cover within a cover, a spy would admit to doing something less serious than espionage, which would hopefully explain away the suspicious activities they were observed to be doing. "Oh no sir, I'm just a tourist taking pictures." "Eyewash" Let's say a CIA officer successfully recruits a member of Russia's intelligence service, the FSB. Since both sides have had problems with their own files being given away to the other side, the CIA officer may make an "eyewash" entry to protect the new source. When writing about the recruitment effort, he or she might write that an attempt was made to get information, but the FSB agent balked at the idea. It's like lying to your own personal diary. "False-Flag Recruitment" A common piece of trade craft involves a spy's effort to recruit an asset by deceiving them into believing they are from a different country. In his book "A Spy for All Seasons," former CIA officer Duane Clarridge writes that "Israelis have often used this technique by impersonating CIA officers when trying to recruit Arabs." "Illegal" Illegals are the spies operating in deep cover. They have no overt relationship with their intelligence service, nor do they operate out of an embassy or have diplomatic cover. They are operating in a country illegally and alone. Sometimes this means they will simply burrow in and pose as just an average person in the neighborhood. As recently as 2010, the U.S. uncovered a ring of 11 "illegals" from Russia who had assumed stolen identities and reported back to Moscow since at least the 1990s. These types of spies could also be referred to as "sleepers" if they are just there, waiting to be told what to do next. "Agent" To intelligence personnel, an agent more often refers to an asset or source from a foreign entity. While movies and media often refer to "CIA agents," the correct term is actually CIA officer. A CIA agent would better describe a mole inside the agency that is under the control of a foreign intelligence service who is throwing secrets their way. "Confusion agent" This is a spy that has the goal of screwing up the opposition's intelligence service, rather than gaining any information. Here's an example: At an embassy function sure to be teeming with military leaders, diplomats, and spies alike, it would be the confusion agent's job to keep the other side's spies occupied with boring chit-chat so he or she can't listen to what the diplomat nearby is saying. "Active measures" The use of a confusion agent can also be put under operations known as active measures — which were often carried out by Soviet intelligence during the Cold War — to spread disinformation, manipulate media, and push propaganda. Former NSA analyst John Schindler wrote about one such operation recently, in which Cuban intelligence was able to influence The Daily Caller website to publish scandalous allegations that U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) was engaging with underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. "Brush contact" You've seen it in spy movies, of course. Also known as the "brush pass," it's a brief encounter between friendly spies to share a few words or documents. These are risky maneuvers, and there are better and safer ways to pass messages, like having a pre-arranged site that is accessed by each side at different times. "In the gap" If it's absolutely necessary that two spies need to meet up for a quick conversation, they'd want to be "in the gap" of surveillance. This means they have no eyeballs, cameras, or microphones pointed in their direction for at least a few seconds, but not any longer than a minute. "Jack in the Box" Besides being a restaurant home to always-great waffle fries, "Jack in the Box" refers to a dummy placed in a vehicle to deceive the other side into thinking there are more people inside. If a spy wants to make it seem like he or she is not alone, they might put a blow-up doll in the passenger seat. "Ghost surveillance" Spies are taught to watch for when they are being watched. In a vehicle, this might mean taking frequent turns or heading out into the country to see if there's a tail. On the street, a spy's eyes would be looking for people who look like they might be a little too interested in what they are doing. But it's much harder to spot "ghost surveillance" — the "extremely discreet and seemingly omnipresent" type of surveillance, according to the manual, which watches the target from out of view. "Spy dust" Also known as Metka, spy dust was a chemical compound used by the Soviet KGB that could be applied to a target to mark them for surveillance. Once applied to clothing, shoes, or elsewhere, the invisible compound could be picked up on infrared by people following, according to Intelligence Reference. "Rabbit" Instead of a target, a rabbit is what intel folks would call the person they are watching and/or following. "Black-bag job" Think of this as the spy's version of breaking and entering, but instead of burglary, the intention is to enter a target's residence to learn more about them without them ever finding out. Also known as "surreptitious entry," the manual says this type of operation is often carried out by FBI agents against foreign intelligence agents operating inside the United States. "Cover stop" Spies are usually working "under cover" but still know they are likely under surveillance. In order to go where they need to go, and ultimately — steal secrets without getting caught — they may make cover stops, which give what appear to be innocent reasons for going out. This could be as simple as a trip to the grocery store where a spy makes a brush pass with a friend in aisle nine. "Rolling car pickup" This term is fairly self-explanatory. It's a move where someone is picked up so smoothly, the car hardly stops or seems like it's just moving forward normally. While not exactly the same, closed-circuit footage from February showed a CIA and Delta Force team capturing a terror suspect off the street in Libya and putting him in a van. The entire sequence took only 40 seconds. "Hello number" If a spy is dialing a hello number, it usually means they are in trouble. This trade craft term refers to a phone call where the person on the other end doesn't identify who or where they are, but only gives a codeword or some other signal the spy will know the meaning to. Random example: Spy calls the hello number and the person on the other end tells he or she that "it's raining in Florida right now." To anyone else listening, it could mean the weather is terrible in the Sunshine state, but the real meaning could be that the spy needs to get on a plane and get out of the country immediately. "Shape" This refers to activities that try to change the behavior, perceptions, and capabilities of an adversary. Similar to "active measures," this bit of jargon deals with preparation that often happens before people may enter a foreign land. Military commanders will say they are "shaping the battlespace" by dropping leaflets in a village for instance, before they send in troops to try to gain intelligence. "Motivation" Motivation holds the same meaning as you probably think, but it's an important term in the intelligence community for when a spy is trying to recruit a source. An asset's motivation for giving away secrets could boil down to ideological, financial, sexual, ego, coercion, or a combination. If a spy wants to recruit a source, he or she needs to understand the "why" first. Historically for American spies, the manual says, the motivation has been money. One of the worst intelligence leaks in U.S. history came from former FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who sold secrets to the Soviet Union, and later Russia, for $1.4 million over 22 years. "Pharming/Phishing" While some hackers break into computers just out of curiosity or in an effort to score some cash, there are plenty of others who are working in the intelligence community. In the U.S., the vast majority are in a special NSA unit called TAO, or Tailored Access Operations (Many other countries have their own versions of this unit). Put simply, TAO is the unit of hackers trying to break into foreign computers, and one technique they can use is pharming. In a pharming attack, a user is redirected to a website other than what they were trying to go to, but they don't know it. For example, TAO could duplicate a bank's website where the target enters in all their account information and logs in successfully, but in the process, the data also gets captured by the hackers. Pharming can be used in conjunction with, or in an independent "phishing attack" — usually in the form of an email that looks friendly but contains links to very unfriendly places. "SCIF" The SCIF, as it's referred to by intelligence professionals, is the acronym for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. It's the room or building where the really sensitive and secret information is held and processed, which has physical and procedural methods to keep those secrets in. Before entering a SCIF, intel analysts usually have to give up their phones, thumb drives, and other media that could potentially be used to take out information. The procedures aren't always followed, as the U.S. Army learned soon after former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning started spilling secrets to the Wikileaks website.  "Triple agent" You may have heard of a double agent, which is a spy playing for both sides. Well, there's also a triple agent. Like the double, this person may "wittingly or unwittingly" withhold significant information from two intelligence services at the urging of a third service. "Clean phone" A clean phone is a brand-new — usually pre-paid — mobile phone a spy can use that won't be traced. These are burners taken out of the box that ensure more secure communications. Of course, that doesn't mean a call couldn't be picked up as it travels over the air, but a spy can at least be safe in knowing the purchase or user probably won't be traced.

                                If you've got $199 to burn then you now have everything you need to enter the Sonos ecosystem of whole-home audio. They've essentially obviated their own Bridge product which, for most people, added an additional $50 barrier to entry and complicated first time setup. Sonos accomplished all of this with software. The Sonos 5.1 update (teased in April) allows the company's range of speakers to operate on your existing Wi-Fi network while promising the same high quality audio performance synonymous with SonosNet — Sonos' bulletproof peer-to-peer wireless <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mesh network">mesh network</a></span> created by wiring the Bridge or a Sonos speaker directly into your router. SonosNet won't go away entirely: you'll still want a wired connection for demanding 3.1 and 5.1... <span class='elision'>Continue reading…</span>

"I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to some of the worst of the disease, especially when people end up dying," said Pooley, who has been the only Briton reportedly infected.

                                Nairobi (AFP) - The death of the leader of Somalia's Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab rebels in a US air strike is a "very strong probability," but still unconfirmed, security sources told AFP Wednesday. "There is a very strong probability that he is dead.... This requires verification on the ground, which is not simple," said a Western security source, who asked not be identified. A senior Somali security official echoed the comment. "We believe that the Shebab leader is dead, though we don't have his body. Most probably he is dead," said the official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. He said he believed the Shebab were now "talking about a successor" to Ahmed Abdi Godane after late Monday's air strike. "But we are still assessing the situation," the official said. A senior Somali security official also said Ahmed Abdi Godane was "most probably" killed. Contacted by AFP, Shebab officials maintained their position of refusing to confirm or deny the reports. "We don't want to comment on this American propaganda that they have killed our leader," a senior Shebab official said. Washington has carried out a series of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> missile strikes in the past, including attacks reportedly targeting Godane -- listed by the US State Department as one of the world's eight top terror fugitives. Godane, 37, who reportedly trained in Afghanistan with the Taliban, took over the leadership of the Shebab in 2008 after then chief Adan Hashi Ayro was killed by a US missile strike. US authorities have offered a $7-million (5.35-million-euro) reward for information on Godane, similar to the bounty on Nigeria's Boko Haram leader. A tip on the Taliban's Mullah Omar is worth up to $10 million, and Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri fetches $25 million. The Shebab are fighting to topple Somalia's internationally-backed government, and regularly launch attacks against state targets, as well as in neighbouring countries that contribute to an African Union force.   Join the conversation about this story »

                                After private photographs of some of the most famous women in the world were posted online, journalists, PR representatives, and curious internet users alike scrambled to figure out how a nameless hacker had gained access to the cell phones of the rich and famous. When shocked internet users on underground forums tracked down the person believed to be behind the leak, his explanation was startingly simple: iCloud.  After hundreds of private photographs were posted online, many commenters struggled to believe that someone had gained access to Apple's online service. The tech giant's online storage and backup service is praised by the company for its simplicity, for the fact that it "just works." And the hack could not have come at a worse time for Apple, which on Tuesday will stage its biggest event of the year: the launch of iPhone 6, a smartwatch, and a new operating system for its Macs, all of which are likely to have new features linked to iCloud. As leaked photographs continued to be posted online, theories emerged regarding their source. Some suggested that a "brute force" hack recently unveiled by Russian security researchers was to blame, while some internet commenters wondered whether venue Wi-Fi at the Emmy Awards had been compromised. But the truth is far more disturbing: The leaked celebrity photos don't originate from a single hack but instead from a collector who gradually added to his haul over months before suddenly deciding to post it online.  This is the story of that collector, who goes by the screenname "OriginalGuy." AnonIB: The Offshoot Hacker Community The anonymous online forum AnonIB launched in May 2006 as an offshoot of the notorious image board 4chan. By mid-2006, 4chan's infamous /b/ forum had become a hostile mess of child pornography, Anonymous hackers, and online trolls. On Aug. 23, 4chan came under a DDoS attack launched by its own users, and many frequent posters left the site to seek alternative messageboards. A group of longtime 4chan posters arrived at AnonIB, which offered a near-identical service. As AnonIB grew in popularity, the site's administrators relaxed the rules. Child pornography and other illegal content was frequently posted on AnonIB, which eventually led to a series of FBI raids on the forum's servers and administrators. After years of upheaval, the site reappeared earlier this year, and the users returned to posting. iCloud Hacking Ring As well as hosting vast amounts of pornography, AnonIB also plays host to a ring of skilled hackers who have learned how to obtain naked photographs of women by breaking into iCloud accounts.  The /stol/ board on AnonIB (short for "Stolen" or "Obtained Photos") serves as a global meeting hub for iCloud hackers. Using specialist password-cracking tools and guessing targets' security questions through Apple's iForgot password reset form, AnonIB hackers are consistently able to gain access to iCloud accounts with only an email address. Once inside, the hackers get to work to extract photographs as quickly as possible, using file-retrieval software to download photo backups. "OriginalGuy" The Porn Collector The leaked celebrity photos weren't the result of a single hack but were instead hoarded over a period of months by one well-connected figure in underworld porn forums. As the Daily Mail reports, AnonIB user "OriginalGuy" has been identified as the source of the leaks, and posts seen by Business Insider on both AnonIB and 4Chan indicate that he has regularly contributed to celebrity porn threads on both sites. But despite knowing the user who leaked the trove of images, we still don't know the identities behind the hackers.  In a post on AnonIB shortly after the main leak of celebrity photos, OriginalGuy explained to other users how he had built up a collection of photos so explosive that image boards were struggling to keep up with page views. The post above makes it clear that the naked celebrity photographs were assembled over a period of months by a team of collectors who specialized in valuable celebrity pornography. On Tuesday, Apple released a statement that appears to confirm that the exploit favored by users of AnonIB was used to hack into celebrity iCloud accounts. Within the statement, Apple blames "a very targeted attack on user names, passwords, and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet." AnonIB hackers use email addresses, password-cracking software, and weak security questions to hack accounts, making it quite likely that the tactics of the hackers at AnonIB were used to gain access to the celebrity photos.  The Nuclear Option One of the most puzzling parts of the celebrity photo leak is why OriginalGuy decided to share his collection at all. With a haul built up over months, the collector claimed to have spent his own money on images of big-name celebrities. Why, then, were photos posted online on a quiet Sunday afternoon before Labor Day?  Pornography hoarders often do not possess skills or talents that they can use online, like an ability to hack. Instead, hoarders are defined by the content they keep. One of the internet's most legendary digital hoarders was "Freezer," a poster on invite-only torrent networks who repeatedly taunted other users with details about the rare music he owned. After his death, it was discovered that Freezer had taken his collection to the grave, asking his family in his will to destroy all the tapes. Whether pornography or music, the knowledge that you possess content nobody else does can be a powerful intoxicant. So if porn collections are so valuable, why did OriginalGuy post his? It seems that OriginalGuy had a sudden realization that his collection wasn't so valuable after all. Rumors of "major win" had circulated online for weeks before the leak. "Win" is a term used to refer to naked or sexual images of women found through hacking their online accounts. It's possible that part of OriginalGuy's collection had, against his knowledge, been sold to somebody else. OriginalGuy admitted to paying "a lot via <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin">bitcoin</a></span>" for a portion of the images when they were being traded between celebrity porn collectors on Friday and Saturday. As Deadspin reports, photographs had been shared online for weeks before OriginalGuy purchased them, potentially rendering his collection of little value. Hours before the photos emerged, posters on AnonIB caught wind of a coming leak of celebrity images. While you might expect pornography fans to react with excitement over such news, many were terrified of what would happen next. OriginalGuy knew that leaking his collection would have dire consequences for the iCloud hackers at /stol/ and the celebrity porn fans at 4chan. Whether he was angry over discovering that his collection was already online, or disappointed to learn that about 30% of his images were fake, OriginalGuy took to AnonIB on the afternoon before Labor Day to begin sharing his collection. The Leak The first site that OriginalGuy visited was AnonIB, his online "home." Censored versions of the leaked photographs were posted first to persuade users to donate <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> to see the full versions.  OriginalGuy seemed aware that his actions were going to bring down the iCloud hackers and celebrity photo-trading ring, remarking that the "bubble" was "going to burst soon." His posts became increasingly frantic as he either expressed frustration over a lack of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> donations, or thanked users for sending him the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital currency">digital currency</a></span>.  After posting photos of Jennifer Lawrence on AnonIB, it seems that OriginalGuy has trouble connecting to the site. Commenting after the hack, OriginalGuy gave insight into what happened as he was leaking the images: I didn't take the money and run. Shit got weird once I started posting samples. AnonIB must have IP blocked me. I was spending all of my time trying to find proxies, and then when I could get on the site, was being hammered by everyone and I couldn't even post. I got some private requests through email, but none ever came through. People wanted shit for free. Sure, I got $120 with my <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> address, but when you consider how much time was spent acquiring this stuff (I'm not the hacker, just a collector), and the money (I paid a lot via <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> as well to get certain sets when this stuff was being privately traded on Friday/Saturday) I really didn't get close to what I was hoping for. Mainly because of the extra <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> spammers spamming their own address ... I proved I had shit, but people wanted more and more for free ... When I posted samples, someone was tracking me, trying to find me. My ISP kept cutting out. Weird emails were coming in. It kinda freaked me out and I had to leave for a couple of hours. It's unclear whether OriginalGuy then visited 4chan to continue posting his images, or whether someone else with access to the collection, sensing that OriginalGuy had decided to cash in, began posting instead. Either way, once the images appeared on the more popular message board, the leak quickly attracted thousands of internet users. A Reddit live thread was created to catalogue and archive the images as they appeared, although it later buckled under the traffic it received. The Aftermath After OriginalGuy "dumped" his collection, many experienced iCloud hackers and celebrity photo traders declared the industry over. Following the hack, posters on AnonIB discussed the repercussions for their industry. While iCloud hackers might believe that their exploit will be closed, Apple has yet to make changes to the iForgot password reset system. OriginalGuy never returned to leak more of his collection, perhaps realizing that his postings on underground web forums were attracting widespread attention. And as for AnonIB, the site remains live, and iCloud hackers are continuing to advertise their skills to users looking to steal naked photographs of women on the internet. <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: Inside The iCloud-Hacking Ring That Leaked Those Naked Celebrity Photos Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                "Biopharming" is a new approach to producing pharmaceuticals. It uses using genetic engineering techniques to induce crops such as corn, tomatoes and tobacco to produce high concentrations of high-value drugs. It has been used to make one of the most promising drugs for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus infections.

                                You've been found.johanl, CC BY The world’s most popular gay social networking app, Grindr, is having a tough time. William Saponaro Jr is suing its developers for negligence, after he was arrested for sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child. Sapnaro claims a 13-year-old boy that he and another man had sex with had been on Grindr – which has a minimum age requirement of 18 – and that the liaison had been arranged via the app. Meanwhile, Thomas Miguel Guerra, an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-positive man living in southern California, has been publicly outed as planning to infect his sexual partners with the virus. We should perhaps not be surprised that these two stories have been so newsworthy. Almost 60 years after the Wolfenden Report was published, which said that “homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence”, gay men’s supposed links with disease and paedophilia still figure in the cultural imagination on both sides of the Atlantic. Then, in late August, it was revealed that without even logging on to the app, internet users could access the exact location of other users of Grindr. While <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span> transmission and child sexual abuse are extremely serious issues, the potential impact of this story, and the number of men that it could affect, makes it worthy of further consideration. This “flaw” in the software allows anyone to pinpoint with alarming precision – about 100 feet – another user’s exact location. Initially Grindr insisted that this isn’t a “flaw” and responded to criticisms by suggesting that users who are uncomfortable with the geo-locative capacity of the app, can simply turn it off. But after a backlash from users, on September 1, it was reported that Grindr has turned off the “distance” option. (An official announcement could not be located and accessing the app in the UK still shows how far away some users are.) Even if the feature is eventually turned off, Grindr’s initial response underscores their lack of respect for users' political and social backgrounds. Grindr’s selling point Grindr became the killer app in gay social media not because of its design or for its communication utility, but because of its geo-locative capacities. Anyone who uses Grindr knows their distance is visible to other users (unless they turn that function off). What few of us knew was that our exact location was being given out. Having spent the past ten years researching gay men’s use of digital and social media, I can testify to this lack of awareness. Social media’s response to Grindr’s “flaw” and users' prior lack of awareness of it points toward concerns that pervade not only gay male digital culture, but digital and social media more generally. Grindr offers a chocolate box of hotties and tells users how close you are to the candy. In doing so, it reinserts geography into gay men’s cruising culture, and resurrects John Rechy’s sexual outlaw for the digital age. Its popularity highlights our willing ignorance of the technologies that we use in our daily lives. I have interviewed men who have called Grindr “addictive”, who say they cannot resist pulling their phones out and checking the local area, even when on a date. Men who have marvelled at the sheer scale of their local gay “community”, even men who have used it to quiz others about whether a given street is a gay-friendly place to live. Easy candy While I doubt the app is actually addictive in the clinical sense, it is certainly alluring. Grindr offers gay men something they have never had before – the ability to “see” one another as they go about their daily lives. Small wonder then that users don’t stop to check the small print of the app’s terms and conditions. When it comes to matters of intimacy, it surely isn’t surprising that many of us didn’t think about the relationship between this sexy little app and, for example, the images of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drone">drone</a></span> attacks reported in the pages of the newspaper we read on the way to work. We, as gay men, have largely been ignorant of Grindr’s “back-end” because we have had little interest in it. It has been enough that it works – quickly, effectively and for free. (Of course, some do care. I know many gay men who would never dream of using Grindr for these specific reasons.) Which brings me on to the second key issue that this glitch illustrates: Grindr’s unwavering and dangerous investment in a culture of Homonormativity. Lisa Duggan of New York University coined the term “homonormative” in 2002. She defines the term as follows: Homonormative means to identify a politics that does not contest dominant heteronormative assumptions and institutions, but upholds and sustains them, while promising the possibility of a demobilised gay constituency and a privatised, depoliticised gay culture anchored in domesticity and consumption. Aligning homonormativity with a broader Anglo-American project of neoliberalism, Duggan argues that the political potential of the 1970s LGBT movement, which challenged gender inequality, the institution of marriage, income disparities, racism and misogyny became marginalised by the 1990s, as white, middle-class gay men became increasingly powerful within a system that was reluctantly accepting them. Such assimilation into the “mainstream” engendered a shift away from radical politics to designer lifestyles … for those who could afford to be good gay consumers. That Grindr initially did not see this location “glitch” as a problem underscores the homonormative politics of the application, and its developers. You have to be invested in a politics of the homonormative in order to both support gay men’s endeavours to connect and simultaneously fail to recognise the implications of rendering such connections visible to anyone who cares to look. Such a belief can only come from those who have evacuated themselves from the ongoing daily struggle of queer people around the world. Grindr’s lack of empathy in their initial response underscores this and suggests that it is the user, as opposed to the service, that is “failing”. The issue, for Grindr, is not one of being outed online, but of remaining in the closet offline. Accordingly, if anyone is at fault here, it is the user, for not living up to their digital persona. Missing the context The fact that Grindr is available in countries where men are routinely beaten, tortured, maimed, flogged, imprisoned, raped and murdered for being homosexual is a shining example of Duggan’s homonormative model at work. I have spoken with wealthy Arab men and women who come to the UK each summer “to be gay”. They talk of Grindr as if it was their saviour, allowing them to connect with one another when back at home. I am in no doubt that, within such contexts, an app like Grindr does feel like salvation. But Grindr’s unwillingness to advertise its intense geo-locative capacities suggests that the developers have little to no interest in the political or social contexts of their users. Or, to be more precise, they are unwilling to consider any context of queer life other than the privileged, white, middle-class Anglo-American one that they inhabit. In 2010, I researched several cases where mobile phones and personal computers – once lifelines for their owners – had been turned against them and used as both evidence and a method of locating other men. But this time it is different. This time, the service is gay-owned designed explicitly for gay men. In its attempt to make their app as addictive as possible they guys over at Grindr have failed to acknowledge the vulnerability of queer people across the world. If there was ever a better example of a “privatised, depoliticised gay culture” then I don’t know what it is.

                                Doctors in Liberia were out on strike on Tuesday as they struggled to cope with the outbreak of the deadly <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus, while the United Nations warned the spread of the disease in West Africa was causing food shortages in one of the world's poorest regions. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said 800 more beds for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> patients were urgently needed in the Liberian capital Monrovia alone, while in Sierra Leone highly infectious bodies were rotting in the streets. MSF called for rich nations to send military medical teams to support buckling healthcare systems in West Africa.

Meanwhile, the grim situation is being made worse by a massive strike among Liberian health care workers, who have accumulated large amounts of unpaid wages while suffering from overwork and the constant risk of exposure. "It's spiraling out of control. The situation is bad, and it looks like it's going to get worse quickly," Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden told NBC News. "There is still a window of opportunity to tamp it down but that window is closing, and we need to act now. ... This is different than every other <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> situation we've ever had.

                                Are you worried that children are using the internet too much? You are a Luddite, according to the Telegraph. Do you oppose <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>? Then you're a Luddite; so proclaims a Nevada newspaper. Don't want a smartphone to replace your wallet? You too are a Luddite, Forbes says. Each of those references to Luddism, taken from the results of a quick Google News search—and, together, fairly representative of how the term is commonly used—has at least one thing in common: They're all wrong. None describes Luddism for what it actually was: a powerful, insurrectionary labor movement designed to protest layoffs and penalize business owners who replaced workers with machines. Of all the terms marshaled out to describe our relationship to technology, 'Luddite' is maybe the most incorrectly and over-used. In modern parlance, it is a broad catchall for anyone who either fears, dislikes, opposes, or refuses to understand technology. It's a synonym for 'technophobe'—which is a travesty to the fearsome, machine-wrecking movement from which the term arose. I spent much of Labor Day this year reading about Luddites past and present, historic social movement and modern anti-tech fable—and found that the gulf between the two couldn't be more yawning. When someone mentions a Luddite, they are typically making a derogatory reference either to a quaint reactionary who is hopelessly behind the times—someone who refuses to buy a smartphone, say—or a critic of any technology whose concerns simply seem hopeless—someone who thinks Facebook is a bad influence, maybe—and is fighting a losing battle against the inexorable march of science, robotization, or progress. To the extent that we're made to conceive of the actual Luddites—19th century textile workers who smashed machines in protest of the disruptive effects of the Industrial Revolution—we have remembered them as a lot of dim malcontents who bashed technology in factories because they were afraid of the encroaching modern world. Luddism is always portrayed as a knee-jerk reaction to technology; a brash, unthinking recoil. But far from this conception of doddering conservatives who blindly smashed gadgets they didn't understand, the Luddites were actually well-organized guerrilla activists who fought a pointed and trenchant battle to protect their livelihoods.  "Luddism," the sociologist Donald MacKenzie writes, "was neither mindless, nor completely irrational, nor completely unsuccessful."  The Luddites were a group comprised mostly of textile artisans who, in the early 1810s, correctly saw the rise of efficient machinery like the power loom as a threat to their way of life. But contrary to their depiction in popular culture, they weren't afraid of the technology itself. They were acutely aware that the work they had been trained to do by hand, the craft they had refined over the course of their entire lives, was about to be made obsolete by a machine. A machine that would do a worse job, but for much cheaper. So some decided to fight back, in an effort to preserve fair pay and what they believed was a healthy, sustainable mode of living. Taking up a moniker inspired by an apocryphal labor hero known as Ned Ludd, his anonymous acolytes sabotaged factory equipment under the cover of night, first in Nottingham, then in Yorkshire and throughout England. (It's interesting to note that the movement itself was based on an ambiguous and probably fictional figure—and the modern incarnation of the term is used ambiguously to describe a fictional version of a historical movement.) And, there's ample evidence that, contrary to common perception, their tactics were, for a while at least, calculated, well-planned, and rather effective. "[T]he Luddites did indeed understand the advantages which mechanization would bring," Raymond Boudon, a sociologist at Paris-Sorbonne University, wrote in his Analysis of Ideology, citing the work of influential historian Lewis Coser. But "their machine-wrecking was an attempt to show the owners of the new textile mills that they were a force to be reckoned with, that they had a 'nuisance value'. By acting in this way, their main objective was to gain concessions from the employers." The Luddites weren't technophobes, then. They were labor strategists.  "This strategic interpretation of the Luddite movement is confirmed by the fact that the workers often destroyed only those machines which were turning out faulty goods," Boudon wrote. "It was still true, of course, that a worker who went on strike could easily be replaced by somebody from the army of unemployed people willing to be strike-breakers, at a time when nascent trade-unionism was harshly suppressed. Since machine-breaking brought the factory to a halt, it was not only a functional substitute for striking, it was also much more effective." The Luddites weren't technophobes. They were labor strategists. The Luddites' strategy, then, was even more effective than a strike, and often very carefully targeted. In his famous essay, The Machine Breakers, one of the first scholarly works that sought to understand the Luddites' true motives, the influential historian EJ Hobshawm called it "collective bargaining by riot." The Luddites' acts of sabotage were enormously successful in drawing attention to the plight of the skilled tradesman, who faced obsolescence before the mechanizing powers of the Industrial Revolution, and they enjoyed widespread support from their communities. A specific law making machine wrecking punishable by death had to be passed in Parliament, and, according to Hobshawm, a force of 12,000 troops were dispatched to put the movement down by force, wherever necessary.  Eventually, the Luddites would fall victim to their own success, as Richard Byrne explains in A Nod to Ned Ludd. The oath-based organization was largely secret—so secret that members wouldn't rat each other out even as they were sent to the gallows—and decentralized, so its more radical elements eventually attempted to assassinate political figures and foment violent revolution.  Though unsuccessful, the extremism eventually steered public opinion safely back into a state in which it could be molded like putty in the governments' hands. This allowed the eventual rebranding of the movement, which left us with the image of out-of-touch goons who so desperately feared and hated progress they smashed any of its instruments they happened upon. This important bit of history has been whitewashed, the toothless version perpetuated by lazy pundits and melodramatic startup boosters. And yet it's an episode that takes on new significance in a reinvigorated age of automation and mechanized job loss. In the information age, use of the word 'Luddite' has skyrocketed, and outside of academia, it's almost always used in the incorrect, technophobic way. Google's Ngram Viewer, which shows how the phrase has occurred in a corpus of books over the last two centuries, shows a boom in usage beginning in the 1960s—as the era of computation was beginning in earnest: That spike saw the term used as a stand-in for technophobia in headlines for magazine pieces, books, and op-eds about computers and nuclear power. The Bulletin of Atomic scientists, for instance, deployed the modern understanding of the term in A Neo-Luddite Interpretation, a 1978 article arguing against expanding military R&D.  In a 1995 piece, Computer World wrote: "If you're not careful, you might be labeled a Luddite—someone who is opposed to technological change."  The same year, The Computer Contradictionary mocked those resistant to computers and technology as Luddites—and certain to come around: "Having failed by stapling checks, folding tab cards, defacing OCR documents, demagnetizing credit cards, and part-paying utility and telephone accounts, the diehard Luddite resolves to continue the struggle from within by becoming an undercover programmer." Usage has continued in that vein up until the present, where today we effectively ignore the actual legacy of the Luddites and instead use their mantle to mock those who would dispute technological determination. But it's worth remembering that there was an important impact of the Luddite movement. Not only did it jolt industrializing society into recognizing that measures had to be taken to address worker concerns and stir up mass popular support, it seeded an enduring body of critical study on the topic. "The working-class critique of machinery, of which machine breaking was the most dramatic concrete expression, left a major mark on British thought," MacKenzie writes. If anything, we should stop using 'Luddite' as a facile insult, and use it to invoke a cautionary tale of what can happen when the specter of automation stokes fears of mass joblessness in an uneasy public—a phenomenon already taking root today.  Some observers are already coming around, and recognizing the actual context of the Luddite movement. The most striking modern day corollary to the Luddite's protest may be Paris's taxi drivers harassing (even smashing parts of) Uber-affiliated cars, which drew more accurate commentary. But even before that, many were of the opinion that anyone opposed to Uber's convenient cab-hailing app business—and in favor of driver protections and regulation—were the new Luddites. Radiohead's Thom Yorke, in another rare instance of Ludditic correctness, responded to Moby's criticism that he was like "an old guy yelling at trains" for opposing Spotify's extraordinarily poor artist compensation by tweeting the following: I am a 45 yr old Luddite and proud of it.. yawn. http://t.co/KdZGwJtxLT — Thom Yorke (@thomyorke) November 26, 2013 That Spotify pays its artists badly obviously isn't the most pressing labor issue posed by technology, but it reflects a greater trend: More convenience, lower wages, fewer jobs.  Luddites should remind us that we need good policies to smooth the road ahead, so we don't strand our skilled workforce when robots and algorithms usurp their employment. Nearly half the world's jobs are poised to fall to automation, remember, and only the rich currently stand to benefit. Which is to say, stop calling people who caution about the deleterious effects of Google Glass 'Luddites'. Stop applying the label to anyone who hates social media. Stop thinking of Luddites as dopey old-timers who get frustrated that they can't program the DVR. Instead, perhaps, step away from the scolding modern mythology, and ask a different kind of question:  Are you a fierce labor activist, willing to risk life and limb to destroy the mechanical implements of your impending poverty, to protest the loss of your livelihood? Then you might actually be a Luddite, according to history. And there may be more of you out there than you think.

                                <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is gaining popularity with retailers, but is it money?Alistair/Flickr, CC BY-SA Professor David Yermack of the Stern School of Business at New York University is used to being heckled when he gives talks about <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. After all, most of his work has involved pointing out all of the things <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> enthusiasts don’t want to hear. On the one hand, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> “believers” want a currency that is essentially free of government and corporate oversight. On the other hand, they want the establishment to believe in the fundamental benefits of it as a currency. Professor Yermack, who once researched the economic impact of the fashion decisions of US First Lady Michelle Obama, has recently turned his hand to detailing some of the bizarre and humorous characteristics of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. Like the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> ATM installed in Melbourne which offered to sell 1 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> for A$585 and buy 1 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> for A$523. Not only was the spread 10.5% but the current market rate for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was $511 and so essentially the ATM company would be losing money on its transactions. Professor Yermack argues <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> should not be considered money, for a number of reasons. These include <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s inability to act as a medium of exchange or a store of value or act as a unit of account. In looking at the way <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> is used (or not) as a medium of exchange, he points out the number of daily transactions of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s has fundamentally not changed in the past year. It has essentially stayed at around 60,000 transactions, which illustrates <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> has experienced almost no growth in popularity, despite the assertion that increasing numbers of merchants are willing to accept it. For many store owners, accepting <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> was about marketing to a particular demographic that is young, tech savvy and relatively well off. As a means of payment, the fact that you have to calculate prices of purchases with amounts such as 0.00301 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> or “3.01 <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> times 10 to the minus 2” effectively means it is never likely to become a unit of account. Professor Yermack’s research on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> volatility found it displayed an average 10% price change per day with an overall volatility of 142% over the course of a year. This compared to Gold’s price fluctuation of 22% in 2013. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>s’ price difference on a range of different exchanges also posed a problem for people trying to actually value <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> at any given point in time. This was something you would never see with US dollars, for example, and contravenes basic economic principles of currency. Another characteristic of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s price during the year was that it was in no way related to the price of any other currency. Significant events in the global economy that impacted currencies like the US and Australian dollar had no effect on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>’s value is derived from its main role, which is as a curiosity and as a means of investment speculation. As a final taunt to the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> faithful, Professor Yermack suggests the entire <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> mining effort could be subverted by a person or government - such as Vladimir Putin - taking control of the peer-to-peer network that essentially validates every transaction. In all likelihood this would be possible, but more research is required to convince the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> community of the validity of the argument. Regardless of what the future holds for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span>, the interest in it has challenged fundamental views of economics, law and finance. Professor Yermack plans to cash this particular <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> characteristic in and is running a course at NYU on <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></span> starting this year. Hopefully something he will share with a wider audience again some day.

The patent appears to cover a method of landing a rocket on a floating platform at sea. In their papers, SpaceX says that "by 2009, the earliest possibly priority date listed on the face of the patent, the basic concepts of 'rocket science' were well known and widely understood. The "rocket science" claimed in the '321 patent was, at best, 'old hat[.]'" Blue Origin has approximately three months to file a preliminary response to the challenge.

                                Data At Work profiles data scientists working at the cutting edge of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span>. Suppose data scientists could track how people move through cities and towns as easily as e-commerce sites track them online? Don't answer that. It's already happening—thanks, at least in part, to a startup called StreetLight Data. StreetLight founder and CEO Laura Schewel was working on a doctorate in energy engineering at UC Berkeley when she had the “ah-ha” idea of using data from cell towers, traffic-data aggregators and GPS satellites to track people's movement patterns in cities and states across the country. Streetlight Data founder and CEO Laura Schewel Initially, Schewel figured the information might help traffic engineers plan new highways and parking. But the data her system aggregates turns out to be useful for much, much more. How To Track Without Tracking Like it or not, it's ridiculously easy to see how people behave online. Cookies and more sophisticated techniques let advertisers track individuals across websites, in part because the online environment is controlled (in just about every sense of the term). This type of tracking, and the related task of gathering insights into peoples' behavior, is much more complicated in real life.  The basic problem is one of putting together all the pieces of a massive puzzle that don't exactly fit. How do you get and make sense of the data generated by ordinary people in order to say with any degree of certainty—in generalized and anonymous but still analytically useful ways—where they shop, which highways they take or even whether they're more likely to take the train on Fridays when the Giants are playing and traffic is lousy in San Francisco? See also: Why Data Scientists Get Paid So Much For StreetLight, it all starts with the cellphone. It probably won't surprise you to know that major carriers collect detailed location data as your phone registers with different cellular broadcast towers (thus providing a detailed record of your movements). But you might not have known that carriers sell access to that data in a format that basically provides a movement record for large chunks of the population. It's all anonymized: The data consists of map plot coordinates and the ID numbers that identify particular phones, with the latter run through a one-way hashing function designed to yield unique numbers that can't be matched to the original IDs.  StreetLight's proprietary pattern-recognition algorithms can infer the "favorite" places of the people covered in the carrier geodata, such as their home and work neighborhoods. Then StreetLight cross references this info with census and other demographic information such as household income, educational status and race. [Corrected: see below] What it ends up with are richly detailed databases that can be used, say, to generate the average profile of someone who might be shopping at Whole Foods at 5pm, dropping a child off at school on a Monday morning, or commuting from San Francisco to the East Bay to work.   Put that way StreetLight sounds sounds sort of creepy—and maybe it is. Schewel and her team, of course, stress that safeguards such as those one-way hashes make it impossible to tie aggregated data about groups back to individual users. “There is no way for us to actually map anything back to individuals. All that data is stripped out long before we get it,” Schewel told me. At the same time, de-anonymizing such information tends to become easier over time, in part because individuals are generating increasing quantities of data about themselves that can serve as a cross-reference to pinpoint actual identities. Whether or not such privacy concerns have merit, this type of data can provide valuable information in a variety of situations. Think companies deciding whether and where to expand; city and transit planners projecting the need for new zoning, transit or roadways; and perhaps developing nations planning new infrastructure and even entire cities. Turning Data Into Information The process by which StreetLight maps together these very different types of data into a coherent dataset turns out to be fairly straightforward. Every month, Schewel’s team receives a messy glob of about 400GB worth of geospatial data from mobile carriers and other data providers. That doesn't sound like much—even given that the load is expected to reach 800GB a month next year—considering that StreetLight's movement patterns cover much of the continental U.S. (The company occasionally also scrapes up Canadian data by accident, and has to discard it.) But geospatial data is fairly lean and has a small footprint, Schewel says. The data is added to StreetLight's existing multi-terabyte data store. StreetLight then pushes the data through a custom extract, transform and load process run through Talend, a popular <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big Data">Big Data</a></span> integration tool. This trims out unnecessary information and reformats different types of data into a uniform schema. Along the way, this process matches up different types of data—cellular-tower location, traffic reports, census patterns, other data sources—at different geographic scales ranging from census block to town or city to region, and along expressways or other transit corridors. All that data gets referenced to particular geospatial locations and, in many cases, to specific time periods as well ("all the time," "weekdays," "rush hour," etc.). What StreetLight Knows About Us All that work links together disparate types of data in a meaningful way, making it possible to get a good sense of where people who fit a particular demographic profile spend their time—and when. Say, for instance, you wanted to know more about people who shop at the Stanford Mall. The StreetLight database might tell you that people over 50 with graduate degrees who live in high-end neighborhoods shop there all the time; families with children from middle-class and high-end neighborhoods shop there on weekends (especially in August and December); and people without college degrees only visit the mall on Monday evenings in the spring. Now that's data transparency. StreetLight can, for instance, help out a retail chain that's thinking about opening a new store with better information about its prospective customers. For instance, whether the average shopper in a proposed mall location earns closer to $50,000 or $100,000, has one child or three, or is a 50-year-old females or a 21-year-old male. As you can imagine, such data is incredibly valuable, and not just to companies. As Schewel explained it to me: We can actually show what might happen if, say, a new freeway off-ramp would be built or a road is changed or even if a big snowstorm hits. We can do this by finding days in the past when an event creating similar conditions occurred. It’s much better than running simulations because it's real behavior. For a decent degree of confidence, StreetLight needs a sample size equal to at least 1% of the population of any location. Schewel prefers 5% to 6% for better signal fidelity, though. X-Raying The Average Shopper Already, StreetLight is proving its worth in some unexpected ways. In 2013, the Oakland Business Development Corporation (OBDC) wanted to increase economic activity in downtown neighborhoods where hundreds of commercial properties lay vacant. Oakland locals, too, were spending up to three-quarters of their retail dollars elsewhere, in part for lack of options. Foodies in the East Bay knew the downtown Oakland dining scene was on fire; OBDC, a nonprofit urban-development agency and business lending organization, tried to capitalize on the boom by courting retailers and developers. But it struck out when its prospects looked at demographic data on nearby neighborhoods, many of which are low-income areas, and backed away. OBDC turned to StreetLight for a clearer picture of downtown Oakland's commercial prospects. Its data revealed that the area regularly draws a healthy mix of wealthy, middle-class and lower income people. OBDC used those findings to convince skeptical store owners to consider locating downtown. But the organization, which also makes loans to retailers, put the data to broader use—primarily to confirm that the area's shopping demographics could support a variety of store types. "That data helped us fill dozens of vacant storefronts over the next year," says Jacob Singer, OBDC's president and CEO. Singer is now considering purchasing StreetLight data as part of retail and urban planning efforts around an upcoming bus-based rapid-transit project slated for downtown Oakland in the next few years. "There really are no comparable alternatives that provide data this detailed and accurate for urban planning and project assessment," he says. Reading The StreetLight X-Ray VeggieGrill, a rapidly growing vegetarian fast-food chain, signed up with StreetLight to learn where people who most closely matched the vegetarian demographic tended to shop and spend their time. Other retailers are using StreetLight data in reverse. Men's Wearhouse, for instance, uses StreetLight not just to spot new store locations, but to identify underperforming stores based on traffic patterns and shopper demographics. StreetLight's data often reveals unexpected patterns—or their absence. Sometimes it shows big differences in the types of shoppers that frequent two adjacent shopping centers, or surprising discrepancies between stores and their neighborhoods. “We can also tell a store chain that the wealthy people who live around a location rarely go to that store,” says Schewel. "For some customers, we have seen surprising dead zones where you would think a ton of people would shop but in fact few venture in." Beyond Shopping Schewel has big plans beyond helping merchants optimize their store locations. Like, for instance, improving public planning in developing countries with detailed data. “Many of these countries don’t have a census and don’t really know how people are moving around, so our information would be the first real data," she says. And since countries that never had widespread land lines often have denser cellphone networks than the U.S., Schewel thinks StreetLight could provide even more detailed user data. Ultimately, StreetLight’s data could also help answer more difficult questions about whole-day transport patterns. These patterns reflect complex human decisions that result in behaviors and traffic patterns that are hard to analyze in isolation. As Schewel told me: We can capture the entire traveling day of citizens. Rather than just seeing what happens when someone is going from home to work, we can see that people have not taken public transit because they have to pick up their child from school or that they are more likely to go to a supermarket to buy groceries on Friday night. This type of detail lets everyone that needs to know how people move see cause-and-effect far better than before. Correction, 11:19pm PT: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the information StreetLight purchases from carriers. It acquires only geolocation data from carriers, not anonymized demographic and user information.

While the low-fat group did lose weight, they appeared to lose more muscle than fat. They actually lost lean muscle mass, which is a bad thing,' Dr. Mozaffarian said.

                                Bottled and ready to go.NIAID/SGK Handout The current outbreak of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> in West Africa has emerged rapidly and evolved with alarming ease. An unprecedented number of lives have been lost and WHO predictions are that the virus will infect in excess of 20,000 people before the situation can be brought under control. This is an extraordinarily challenging time for the nations affected, many of which have fragile, inadequate health infrastructures and have been unable to contain the outbreak. International efforts are now required to strengthen and implement comprehensive emergency response strategies across the areas affected and most at risk. Accelerated development An important part of the measures to be implemented involves fast-tracking access to treatment and vaccine options in order to reduce morbidity and mortality rates and help stop transmission. The gravity of the current epidemic is such that for the first time in history an international consortium has been assembled in order to accelerate the development and deployment of potential <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccines. At the Jenner Institute in Oxford we will run the first phase I trial of a vaccine targeted at the Zaire strain of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus that is causing the current outbreak. The main purpose of this first-in-humans trial in the UK is to establish a detailed safety profile of the vaccine and assess the type of immune responses it induces before it could be considered for widespread use. A further goal is to identify the most suitable dose of the vaccine. The vaccine is being co-developed with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the National Institutes of Health who are running parallel human phase I trials in the US. Our trial is being funded with a £2.8m grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development. Chimpanzee adenovirus ‘Cold’ virus in chimps is being used to deliver dose. Onkel_wart, CC BY-NC-SA The candidate vaccine in question uses a chimpanzee adenovirus (a type of respiratory virus) as a means to expose or prime the immune systems of volunteers to a specific protein that exists on the surface of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. The vaccine contains some genetic material but not the entire <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus genome so it cannot cause an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> infection. As with the US trial, the adenovirus also will not replicate but instead prompts the person vaccinated to express an <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> vaccine that the immune system will later recognise if the person became infected. Previously it has been tested in animal models and has demonstrated impressive effectiveness at protecting against infection and promoting recovery from animals later exposed to <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>. Just a single dose was required to induce very high levels of protective efficacy. Chimpanzee adenoviruses have been used extensively in clinical trials for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria">malaria</a></span>, hepatitis C and other infections but no vaccine of this type has been licensed as yet. In the 25 clinical trials of chimpanzee adenoviruses that have taken place, the safety profile of this type of vaccine has been good. At present, ethical and regulatory approvals are being prioritised so that the trials may begin in the UK in September 2014. This will be run in parallel with a cohort in the US and extended to The Gambia and Mali shortly thereafter. At the same time, 10,000 vaccine doses will be stockpiled by GSK in order that, should the vaccine meet safety requirements, it may be deployed without any further delays. The candidate vaccine will be tested in 60 healthy volunteers over the age of 18, who we will shortly begin recruiting. During the trial volunteers will be administered a single dose of the vaccine into the muscles of the upper arm and blood samples will be taken at specific time points. In all, volunteers will be expected to attend for a total of nine clinic visits over six months. Clinical trials are an essential part of the vaccine development process and invaluable tools when it comes to understanding and ultimately improving the processes that provide vaccine-mediated protection from disease. In order gain the upper hand over <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span>, we need all the help we can get.

                                Online and mobile can also make a difference.Legnan Koula/EPA With a high fatality rate and a terminal phase that causes bleeding and haemorrhagic fever, the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus has always attracted grisly fascination, yet funding and action against it have never been particularly high. The current outbreak in West Africa is unprecedented – it has now killed more than 1,500 people – and it appears to have stimulated a chain reaction, from treatment using experimental drugs and fast-tracking human trials, to mapping the genomes of the virus in order to gain better understanding of the species involved. But what has prevented this outbreak from being easily contained is the lack of public health infrastructure in the region. Preparedness The current outbreak in West Africa should stimulate a complete shift in public health policy. If future occurrences of this and other emerging diseases are to be prevented or their impact minimised, we need to learn a great lesson now. An effective treatment for <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> would be good, a vaccine to prevent the disease even better, but the best thing that could come out of this is a more organised and trusted public health system. First and foremost, none of the developing countries that have been hit, including Liberia, and Sierra Leone, were prepared nor had the capacity to manage the outbreak. For this you need trained personnel and a good public health infrastructure. For example, it was only after the outbreak that many hospitals saw the need to create quarantine units or holding centres, despite <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> being a real health risk. Getting people to come forward to be immediately isolated has been a problem. Communication The publicity given to the outbreak has also been unprecedented – thanks to the 24/7 news cycle, the internet and affordable mobile phones. Good communication is crucial, but it’s clear that media can be used to spread bad as well as good messages. Monrovian mobile phone repairer. Themepap, CC BY-NC In Nigeria, which thankfully has not seen a full-blown outbreak, panic as well as the rumour that drinking or bathing in salt water can prevent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> infection has led to at least two deaths. In Liberia, where a national curfew was set up, violent clashes took place in the West Point slum area of Monrovia after a quarantine was ordered. While tension is perhaps inevitable, the situation could have been managed better. Without being able to drive home alternative messages to build trust, counter the stigma of the disease and tell people what symptoms to look out for and what to do, then there will be a problem. Mobile phones are now affordable for many in African countries and are an asset for disseminating useful health education, particularly during emergencies. However, the information must come from trained public health officials with an appropriate background in risk communication – rather than those only interested in sensational news broadcast. These skills could better assist politicians, the press and government officials in communicating appropriately. Bush meat. JB Dodane, CC BY-NC There are also cultural issues around the eating of game meat (bush meat), a delicacy in most West African cultures and the likely origin of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus, like plague, rabies, psittacosis, Lyme disease and others, are zoonotic diseases or infections transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans. It should follow, then, that avoiding or protecting the species that harbour them would be one plausible approach for preventing future outbreak. This would mean beginning a process of reconciling the protection of the species for biodiversity with that of zoonotic disease prevention. In other words, some wildlife species known to harbour pathogens that are transmitted to humans such as monkeys, bats, chimpanzees, should be regulated. Firmer commitments There is the need for national governments in Africa to start or improve their public health infrastructure and health staffing to address future outbreaks of infectious diseases which are inevitable – particularly in view of climate change effects and the resulting shift in disease spread. Despite a commitment in the Abuja Declaration to allocate at least 15% annual budgets to health care by 2015, only six countries in Africa – including Liberia – have met this goal. According to World Health Organisation figures about a quarter of African Union member states were spending less on health now that they were in 2001. Now is the perfect time to push for countries to make good on their promises. And it will also impact other big problems such as <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>, tuberculosis and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria">malaria</a></span>. Public health is all about preventing diseases before they happen and in poorer countries, the need is even greater. Moving forward, individual African nations and in collaboration with the African Union, should formulate public health policies and statutes for training, research and developing infrastructure in line with what obtains in more technologically advanced nations. This must come in addition to the clinical research around the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus itself. By so doing, the WHO and Centers of Disease Control in the US and the respective ministries or departments of health in West Africa can share data and best management practices for addressing these emergencies in the future. There are other issues such as the enormous economic losses and ratings agency Moody’s has already warned of the potential impact of the virus on the region. So when it comes to costs, it is better for African counties to avoid being penny wise and pound foolish by investing more in preventive rather curative measures that may or may not exist in the future.

                                So this is how it ends: With volcanoes erupting in Iceland and Papua New Guinea this summer, Murphy's Law suggests it's only a matter of time before the U.S. gets its due. And according to the American Geophysical Union, we may have a candidate: The Yellowstone "supervolcano," a slumbering giant that most recently erupted from beneath Yellowstone National Park 640,000 years ago.

But perhaps inspired by the musings of amateur geologists – who see recent <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=helium">helium</a></span> emissions and odd bison migrations as ominous signs – the Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems journal has published a study projecting the fallout from such an event.

                                This progression is known as Moore’s law. For more than 100 years, the processing power of computers had doubled every 18 months. Computers and the information technology that they enable are absorbing other fields. So we are seeing exponential advances in sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, 3D printing, and so on.

                                The news: In a major victory for environmentalists, California may soon become the first state to officially ban all plastic bags. The state legislature has narrowly approved a measure to remove all lightweight, single-use plastic bags from grocery, convenience and liquor stores by 2016, grandfathering in the more than 100 cities and counties that have already taken action to ban the bags on their own, according to the Sacramento Bee.  Source: Getty ImagesFierce opposition from paper and plastic bag industry lobbyists and national manufacturing companies now makes signing the bill a tough choice for Gov. Jerry Brown, a moderate Democrat with a long commitment to environmental issues but a mixed record on issues like <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>. Conservatives in particular are rankling Brown, calling the measure another nanny state law. My tweet made this story on the lame plastic bag ban -> http://bit.ly/1zY6WN6 (story by @davidsiders).

                                China has made rapid progress in four key domains of global health.

                                The news: World Health Organization doctors warned Thursday that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ebola">Ebola</a></span> virus epidemic in West Africa could eventually grow to as many as 20,000 cases, over six times the currently understood scale. The WHO also said a new containment plan estimates that the number of cases in the worst-hit areas may be two to three times as high as officially recognized. New figures indicated 1,552 of 3,069 confirmed cases have resulted in death in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria, while at least 40% of all cases appeared in just the past three weeks. The epidemic in West Africa has shown no signs of slowing down, and it may soon expand in an unprecedented way that threatens to devastate local populations and overwhelm the region's health authorities.

                                IN 2012 China’s main planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, declared that the country would produce 60 billion-100 billion cubic metres of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span> a year in 2020. It needed those forecasts to be accurate.They weren’t. Wu Xinxiong, the director of China’s National Energy Administration, recently predicted that only 30 billion cubic metres a year will come on stream by 2020. That would barely meet 1% of China’s energy needs now, let alone in 2020.This is profoundly disappointing. With more than 30 trillion cubic metres of recoverable <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shale gas">shale gas</a></span>, China has the largest reserves in the world, almost 70% more than in America, home of the shale-gas revolution. It is also a setback to the country’s efforts to reduce pollution. Dirty coal now makes up about 70% of energy consumption and, despite fast growth in renewable energy, gas is the only cleanish energy source that could displace enough coal to rein in carbon emissions quickly.China has found that replicating America’s shale strategy—even with American help—is harder than it expected. <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fracking">Fracking</a></span> works by injecting millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale and releasing gas. American shale seams are mostly found in easily accessible areas at quite shallow depths, and formed of rock that is easy to fracture. China’s are mostly deeper,...

Millions of gallons of a cocktail of water, sand and chemicals are injected into the horizontal wells at high pressure, fracturing the shale, releasing the gas—and causing violent protests in Europe and parts of America.Geothermal energy, by contrast, has yet to stir much controversy. Most geothermal plants are located where water has seeped down into the Earth’s crust, been heated and forced back up through permeable rock. Drill a well to between 3,000 and 12,000 feet, and the searing water and steam can be released to drive generators.Geothermal is a minnow among power sources. America has the world’s highest installed capacity of geothermal generating plants—3.4 gigawatts’ worth at last count (see first chart)—but they generate only 0.4% of its electricity (see second chart). New “enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS), however, look set to...
