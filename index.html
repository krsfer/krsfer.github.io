                                Stocks are higher, but basically flat. The Dow is up 4 points, the S&P 500 is up 1 point, and the Nasdaq is up 12 points.  The market opened lower following data that showed consumer prices surged in May and housing starts that fell more than expected, but quickly reversed higher before falling to trade basically flat. U.S. Treasury yields are higher, with the 10-year yield up to 2.64%. On the economic data front, consumer prices climbed 0.4% in May, more than the 0.2% that had been expected. On a year-over-year basis, prices climbed 2.1%, and 2.0% excluding food and energy. Housing starts in May fell 6.5% month-over-month, more than the 3.9% decline that was expected by economists. The Federal Reserve kicked off its latest FOMC meeting, which will culminate in the central bank's latest monetary policy announcement tomorrow afternoon, followed by a press conference from Fed Chair Janet Yellen.  In corporate news, <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>'s <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SolarCity">SolarCity</a></span> announced plans to build one of the world's largest solar plants in upstate New York. Musk's other public company, Tesla, is also rallying, making two big days for one of the world's most influential businessmen.  Earlier this morning, the U.K. reported inflation that fell to its lowest level since 2009 and housing prices that have accelerated to their fastest pace since the crisis.  Last night, President Obama said the U.S. is sending 275 troops to Iraq to "provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad." Crude oil prices are near $107 a barrel, as the situation in Iraq remains unstable. The situation in Ukraine is also on the mind of investors, after Kiev yesterday said Russia cut off all gas to the country.  Join the conversation about this story »

                                If you're angling for the corner office, you need to have gravitas.  Having gravitas — a serious manner that commands respect — communicates that you have what it takes, says economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett. "You need to be seen as someone who knows their stuff cold and can go three to four questions deep in the their domain." Hewlett came to this finding as part of researching her new book "Executive Presence." She and her team at the Center for Talent Innovation surveyed 4,000 American professionals looking for the signals people need to send in order to be tapped for a leadership opportunity.  But it's not all about your accomplishments.  "(Gravitas) is about what you signal, the impressions you give," Hewlett says. "It's not about performance. It's about when you're given the chance at the next opportunity, and of course that's a big part of whether you'll succeed or not."  To that end, projecting gravitas to your boss, colleagues, and clients is a matter of "embodying your intellectual horsepower," she says.  Of course, in a workplace setting, not everybody is going to be directly familiar with your work beyond your boss and your most immediate colleagues. The key, Hewlett says, is to project capability to the far reaches of the organization, even if people don't necessarily know what it is you're doing.   To send those signals, do the following:  1. Look polished. If you look unkempt, you don't look capable.  2. Know what you're going to say before you say it. If you don't speak with clarity, people simply won't listen to you. 3. Show some cultural fluency. Adapt your speaking style to your environment, whether Wall Street, Silicon Valley, or points in between.  For the full list of suggestions for showing you have gravitas, go here. "You don't get a shot at showing your actual skills unless you're given an opportunity," Hewlett says. "It's incredibly linked to your career journey." <span class='elision'>SEE ALSO: 5 Keys To Making A Great First Impression Join the conversation about this story »</span>

                                Hard sell: can Obama convince Americans to trust Iran?EPA/MARTIN SIMON / POOL Charles Dudley Warner’s oft-quoted suggestion that “politics makes strange bedfellows” is never better illustrated than the prospect of a rapprochement between Iran and the United States. Stimulated by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria’s (ISIS) rapid military advances in Iraq, both sides find themselves on the same side – albeit for vastly different reasons. Iran wants to preserve the Shia government and, with it, Iran’s new influence there as part of a broader regional strategy. The Obama administration’s goal is to sustain Iraq as a country, thereby avoiding the creation of yet another “ungovernable territory” in which jihadists can be trained as terrorists and organise attacks on American interests both at home and abroad. The irony is evident. Tehran and Washington, have fought a proxy war for more than three decades by supporting Hezbollah and Israel. But facing a common enemy, they now contemplate having to co-operate out of necessity. Doing so will not be easy. The leadership on both sides will have to overcome significant domestic and – to no small extent – international opposition in order to do so. Barack Obama has already faced significant opposition from Republicans at home over the multilateral agreement with Iranians over their nuclear programme. Republicans have a widespread lack of trust of Iran’s mullahs and the Revolutionary Guard. They believe that Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, is not in charge: that his reformist agenda is too fragile and that he is not a reliable negotiating partner. He is a more amenable face than his predecessor, the widely despised Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but little more. US divided on Iran A Pew opinion poll survey of the American public at the end of last year reflected this broad concern. A plurality of 42% disagreed with the multilateral agreement reached with Iran. Interestingly almost exactly the same percentage of the American public – 43% – holds a very unfavourable view of Iran. In other words, there is a solid bloc in the US who will oppose working with Iran on any issue. Most of them, however, can not be counted among the president’s supporters. And in Washington’s partisan climate, his record suggests Obama is unlikely to take their views into account when it comes to deciding on American foreign policy. Hassan Rouhani needs to sell a rapprochement to Iran’s conservatives. EPA/S Sabawoon The clear exception to this generalisation is America’s Jewish community. They are traditionally stalwart supporters of the Democratic Party. As a whole, they are deeply distrustful of Iran. Yet they fragment on the issue of whether and how to engage its new leaders. A minority, for example, lined up solidly behind Benjamin Netanyahu’s view that the nuclear agreement with Iran was an “historic mistake”. Reluctantly at times, they sided with the president’s Republican critics. The majority of American Jews, however, supported the nuclear agreement, nonetheless invoking the adage that the US should “trust but verify”. Meanwhile, Israelis are understandably worried by the prospect of Tehran’s further engagement with the US. To them, it is another sign of Iran’s growing regional importance. No appetite for war So how can we evaluate the prospects for further US-Iranian engagement against this backdrop? President Obama has clearly repudiated the idea that the United States will return troops to Iraq in large numbers. Poll after poll suggests that the American public is in no mood for a large-scale foreign military intervention anywhere, let alone in Iraq. Having spent the first six years of his presidency extricating America from two wars, President Obama is not inclined to dive back into that morass. All presidents in their second term look towards their legacy, and he wants to preserve his own as a president who ended wars, not one that initiated them. The purpose of the small troop deployment that will be sent to Baghdad, he therefore made clear, is to protect America’s embassy – and more importantly American lives – should they be needed. There will be no large-scale deployment of American “boots on the ground” in Iraq. Yet this does not preclude the use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span> or fighter jets to repel ISIS, signaled by the movement of the George H W Bush aircraft carrier into the Persian Gulf. The fact that their use against ISIS could effectively reinforce Bashir Al-Assad’s position in Syria will only add pressure on President Obama to then turn his attention again towards Syria, as that humanitarian crisis mounts. As usual, complications in the Middle East abound. View from Tehran The clear and abiding question concerns what the Iranians will do with that newfound influence if they do work with the Americans? If, as a result, the mullahs feel emboldened and become more demanding, then any expedient accord will be short lived. In that case a temporary respite to the generally hostile trend of the last three decades could actually be followed to a worsening of the state of affairs. Critics of the president’s policy of engagement will predictably – and perhaps justifiably – accuse him of naivety. The prospect of further nuclear program agreements and an easing of multilateral sanctions against Iran will be irreparably damaged. Meanwhile in Iraq: Shia militias assembling in Baghdad. EPA/Stringer If President Obama engages with Iran, he will be taking a grave political risk. Yet if the mullahs reward Obama’s political bravery and set aside their historic antipathy towards America, there is the tantalising prospect of another course of action that could change the future of the Middle East. If they back Rouhani, if they use this moment as a platform for a policy of reassurance towards America and Europe rather than one of confrontation, then it could spark a virtuous circle of improved relations. That co-operation could extend across several key policy issues. Both Iran and the West would benefit from this development. Even Israel might be convinced of its value if – and only if – Iran would subsequently abandon its long-held support for Hezbollah. Iraq and Syria are in crisis, a crisis that is quickly engulfing the region. But never was the adage that “out of crisis comes opportunity” more evident. Middle Eastern and American leaders have always been quick to reject such opportunities. Maybe this time they will surprise us.

                                Hopefully the hats died with the terminology.Archives New Zealand, CC BY-SA I downloaded a new keyboard onto my phone yesterday and was pleasantly surprised to see it suggesting the word “to” after I had typed “going”. It “knew” that the phrase “going to” was a very common pair of words and managed to use this in order to speed up the message I was sending. The next word it suggested was “be”, and then “late”. While I was less pleased that to see my phone pre-diagnosing my punctuality problem, it had indeed correctly predicted the message I planned to send. This is a practical application of something called “corpus linguistics”. And now that the good people of Google have developed a tool called the n-gram viewer, some of its insights are open to all. Anyone can now become an armchair linguist. Corpus linguistics is essentially a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> approach to studying language that predates the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span> age. It can be traced back to the earliest days of linguistic study, when people counted the frequency of words and other patterns in the Bible. But it has really taken off in the past 20 years thanks to a massively increase in the availability of sources. Sometimes these collections, known as corpora, are massive online libraries: sometimes they are smaller and more specialised. But none is larger than Google Books, which provides us with an unparallelled treasure trove of sources to scour in our quest to understand how language has changed. Studying these sources has greatly enhanced our understanding of how words work together, and also how they may carry certain other qualities. We know, for example, that the verb “cause” is often used in a negative sense, as in “cause a problem” or “cause delays”, whereas the term “lead to” is generally more neutral. Many big sources of language contain millions of words but Google’s database, sometimes called the World Brain, contains millions of books. It’s a collection that has emerged out of Google’s attempt to digitise every book ever written. A huge team of people and robots are working to scan hard copies of books to add to the database and while it is nowhere near complete, its size is already extraordinary. The n-gram viewer lets users find out how often a word has appeared across the whole library of books and the results are illuminating. If you type in the words “email”, “telegram” and “telephone” into Google Books, for example, you can see how these various forms of communication technology have come in and out of fashion over the years. You can see that use of the word “telegram” peaked in the 1920s and 1930s before beginning a steady decline. You can chart the rapid rise of email in our lexicon since its introduction into the mainstream in the 1990s and see how we appear to fall in and out of love with the telephone. And if you put in the word “wireless”, n-gram shows how the word was popular, then got lost in the wilderness for some time before coming back with a different meaning. Changing attitudes There are other shifts that can be seen beyond the use of technology. A comparison of the phrases “air stewardess” and “cabin crew” is one example of the rise of gender neutral language since the 1970s. It also shows the persisitance of the gender specific variant. Sometimes the data can be deceptive though. The graphs show that “male nurse” is a much more common phrase than “female nurse” but that its use has been in decline since the 1970s. But that doesn’t necessarily mean there are more male nurses or that fewer men have become nurses in the past 40 years; it may simply have seemed necessary in the past to explicitly state that a nurse was male when the profession was more readily associated with women. Peace and love Some of the charts can be fairly depressing, while others can be uplifting. Anyone will tell you that the path of true love never did run smooth, and nor has our use of the word over the years. Google tells us that peace seems to be making a comeback after a tough few decades, as do faith and hope. But charity is far less talked about. Politics and Language This is a blunt tool but it can provide a jumping off point for investigating some complex issues. Use of the term “neo-liberal agenda” has overtaken the term “socialist agenda” in recent years. It’s not immediately clear why but trying to find that out could take you in all kinds of directions. And some graphs can make us instantly question a popular belief. The term “broken Britain” has become something of a catchphrase for the current UK government, but it seems it actually has a surprisingly long history. The fact that its use spiked around 1950 and again in the mid-sixties might put to bed the idea that the youth of today are worse than ever. There are of course many things that don’t turn up in n-grams and many pose more questions than they answer but they give a fascinating insight into the way language has changed to reflect our culture. Or perhaps, as some graphs might indicate, the culture is changing to reflect the language.

                                Ebola might be happy but you won't be.CDC/Cynthia Goldsmith/Public Health Image Library This morning you woke up feeling a little unwell. You have no appetite, your head is aching, your throat is sore and you think you might be slightly feverish. You don’t know it yet, but Ebola virus has started to attack your immune system, wiping out the T-lymphocyte cells that are crucial to its proper function. These are the same cells that the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span> virus (<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>-1) attacks, but Ebola virus kills them far more aggressively. Exactly when and where you caught Ebola virus is unclear, it can take anything between two and 21 days from initial infection to the first symptoms. What is more certain is that you are now infectious yourself. Your family, friends and anyone in close contact with you are all in mortal danger. The next week or so will determine if you are one of the lucky minority who survive. In the 24 Ebola virus outbreaks prior to the present one, a cumulative total of 1,590 people, two-thirds of all cases, have died. The current outbreak, which began in the village of Meliandou in eastern Guinea in early December 2013, and which has now spread across Guinea and into the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia, has killed 251 people as of June 5, nearly half of the identified cases. The west African Ebola epidemic is now the largest outbreak seen since Ebola virus was discovered in 1976. The World Health Organisation issued its first communiqué on the situation on March 23, and since then has been producing regular reports. Ebola 1979-2008 Zach Orecchio , CC BY-SA Over the next few days your condition deteriorates. Your body aches all over, you have chronic abdominal pain, the fever intensifies and you start to vomit and develop diarrhoea. After anything between a couple of days and a week of misery, you will have reached the crisis point – now the symptoms will either gradually recede or you will progress to the horrors of “cytokine storm”, a convulsion of your ravaged immune system that will plunge you into the terminal phase of Ebola virus disease known as haemorrhagic fever. Cytokine storm releases a torrent of inflammatory molecules into your circulatory system. Your own immune system, now completely out of control, attacks every organ in your body. Tiny blood vessels burst everywhere and you begin slowly to bleed to death. The whites of your eyes turn red, your vomit and diarrhoea are now charged with blood and large blood blisters develop under your skin. You are now at the peak of infectiousness as Ebola virus particles, ready to find their next victim, pour out of your body along with your blood. Fortunately, however, it seems you have survived. Rehydration therapy kept you strong in the initial phase and pure luck saved you from haemorrhagic fever. Understanding why some Ebola virus patients avoid the terminal phase is an active area of research, and one possible answer is that those whose T-lymphocytes survive the initial attack of the virus possibly retain sufficiently intact immune systems. Even when you are merely in the first phase of feeling vaguely unwell, it may be possible to determine if you will live or die. Even though you are feeling much improved, and perhaps even ready to return to work, you will remain infectious for a while. All your bodily fluids will still contain virus. In particular, the virus can be sexually transmitted, especially if you are a man, up to 40 days after recovery. Epidemiological modelling studies have shown that Ebola virus is about as infectious as influenza or very slightly more so – each infected person will probably infect two to four others. That’s not tremendously infectious compared to some of the super-infectious viruses such as measles or polio, which have corresponding numbers of five to 18, but it is nevertheless enough to sustain a pandemic. The question of why we haven’t seen a worldwide pandemic of Ebola in pre-modern times therefore becomes rather perplexing. Where did it come from? A briefly popular theory of a few years ago, that the Black Death of the 14th century was caused by Ebola virus, and that the famous mediaeval descriptions of buboes were actually haemorrhagic fever blood blisters, has now been convincingly excluded by DNA analyses that have proved beyond doubt that the Black Death was, after all, bubonic plague as originally thought. Ebola may well be a purely modern disease and, since Ebola virus made its first known appearance in 1976, a whole generation of African medical workers have been drilled to be alert to the symptoms of haemorrhagic fever. Consequently, the World Health Organisation and its partners have been able to suffocate outbreaks before they spread more generally. However, the latest outbreak is proving rather more recalcitrant than expected and the story is not yet over.

                                As an enabling technology, ICT reaches into many fields including health, cybersecurity and engineering (shown here).Kevin Tong/Flickr, CC BY AUSTRALIA 2025: How will science address the challenges of the future? In collaboration with Australia’s chief scientist Ian Chubb, we’re asking how each science discipline will contribute to Australia now and in the future. Written by luminaries and accompanied by two expert commentaries to ensure a broader perspective, these articles run fortnightly and focus on each of the major scientific areas. This instalment takes a look at ICT’s role. It’s finally dawning on private and public sectors that information and communications technology (ICT) is an enabling technology. ICT is relevant to companies – whether making drugs, mining coal, building a bridge or providing banking services – and government agencies, such as the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), operators of an urban railway systems and (obviously) Social Security and Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DTSO). One or two decades ago, it was common for casual commentary to suggest that Australia had missed the ICT bus: ICT multinationals, almost all foreign-owned, generally weren’t interested in doing more than selling in Australia ICT-based small and medium enterprises (SMEs) faced the usual challenges impacting all SMEs, and the additional one – their ICT specialist R&D staff were less qualified on average than R&D staff across other disciplines CSIRO was perceived – perhaps unfairly – as not having significant impact in the area international rankings of Australian computer science publication citations showed us a long way behind even the world average. These days, public perceptions of ICT’s importance are far more developed. Almost every day, we interact with a supermarket scanner, we check our email, we pass under a motorway toll point, we download our power bill or we check what our friends on Facebook are doing. Louise Billeter/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA There is Australian software in more than a billion mobile phones worldwide. And while just a small fraction of those phones are in Australia, there are certainly enough that the community at large appreciates the transformational power of ICT and how pervasive it is, even if it is often behind the scenes. The National Broadband Network (NBN), an ICT construct if ever there was one, has been the subject of significant political controversy and raised public awareness of the pervasiveness of ICT. What’s down the track, then? Our everyday lives are going to be affected in an extraordinary number of ways, most involving the coupling of ICT ideas with technologies with which we are familiar. Likely scenarios include: instead of swallowing pills or receiving injections, devices in our body may administer drugs automatically, at times and dosage levels tuned to our body’s requirements firemen will be equipped with micro airborne vehicles to search a burning building for survivors all road vehicles will be fitted with sensors and devices to communicate with other vehicles and roadside infrastructure, to lessen collisions, and to reduce congestion through the provision of real-time advice; in due course, traffic densities on freeways will be increased through automated control of vehicles the ATO website will accept queries on curly tax issues and provide an answer via an automated service which the taxpayer can rely on in meeting his or her tax obligations partial sight will be restored through a bionic eye to people who have become blind through diseases such as macular degeneration (see video below) people will improve their qualifications through enrolment in massive open online courses (MOOCs), receiving a grade after automated processing of their assignments and examination papers many farm fences will be eliminated; farm animals will be provided with sensors designed to localise the animal’s position and deliver an electric shock when it strays from a defined region people will discuss contracts with a non-English-fluent Korean businessman using a two-way, unobtrusive real-time translation phone app, or via an add-on to a three-dimensional Skype system robot floor cleaners in the home will be as fast and as efficient as vacuum cleaners pushed by a human. This list highlights the pervasiveness of ICT applications, and no doubt countless more examples can be advanced. Almost everyone would agree too that we would be better off with such advances (though with qualifications with issues such as privacy and security). So what is involved in getting there? Arlo Bates/Flickr (cropped), CC BY-NC-SA A passive approach is to imagine that using money earned from trade in agriculture or mining or education, we could simply buy tasty ICT morsels catching our fancy in the international market. But this won’t work. We must have ICT skills: if we don’t, not only do we miss out on the pots of gold associated with the different business opportunities, but we will be ill-informed purchasers of sophisticated products. If buying internationally, we could be as much victims of a ruthless vendor as the Icelandic bankers who purchased foreign financial products that ruined their country in 2008. Imagine trying to decide what is the best technology or technologies for an NBN with little or no expertise. The required human capital clearly must come from universities, and will only be up-to-date if the universities have adequately resourced staff of international standard. Three simple steps to maximise ICT talent First, it needs to be very easy for ICT researchers to collaborate with researchers in other disciplines; so many future applications will rest on a further disciplinary pillar besides ICT, precisely because it is an enabling technology. Of course, institutional players such as the universities and the Australian Research Council (ARC) will sign on to this proposition, but giving effect to it can be still very challenging. Fundamentally, prestige for an academic grounded in his or her achievements is generally seen as easier to attain when a single discipline is involved. Those crossing two (or more) disciplines are more likely to be considered as not making it well in either rather than achieving a high standard in more than one discipline. An example of cross-disciplinary research: brain-computer interfacing. Sybren Stüvel/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND Then there’s the question of money: if discipline-based panels allocate research funds, such researchers can lose out. The second qualification is that the route to commercialisation of ideas needs to be straightforward. In the ICT area commercialisation has been hugely assisted by the creation in 2002 of NICTA. This organisation has provided a bridge not only between its own researchers and the commercial world (including business creation with start-ups) but also between affiliated ICT researchers in universities and the commercial world. Commercialisation is less the core business of universities than it is of NICTA, and most universities have less depth of ICT-relevant commercialisation skill set than NICTA has. A third requirement is that it must be possible to pursue large-scale research ideas with public sector finance. With the limited exceptions provided by Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) or ARC centres and defence-oriented work in DSTO, CSIRO and NICTA are probably the only examples. A healthy coupling of the university sector to the commercial world is certainly not the whole story. That coupling needs to be grounded in a solid disciplinary base where the individuals can match it with the best in the world. The science of cyber analytics supports better predictions and guides adaptive responses of computers and computer networks. PNNL - Pacific Northwest National Laboratory/Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA Specialists are needed in subdisciplines such as cyber security, machine learning, computer and communication networking, large scale and distributed systems, mobile communications and computing and <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>, to name a few. But without our ICT experts, we’ll be left behind the wayside – and catching up will be more difficult than ever. David Glance, Associate Professor at the University of Western Australia It is easy to confuse Australia’s passion for being users of the latest technology with a passion to be involved in creating them. Dwindling degrees. penguincakes/Flickr (cropped), CC BY-NC-SA In fact, as the US continues to see a rise in enrolments in computer science degrees, Australia has seen a continuous decline. It is not that Australians are less bright or resourceful or less hard working. It is not even a tyranny of distance because if there is one thing you can do remotely, it is develop and sell technology, especially software. No – it may simply be the fact that on the whole, Australians are just not interested in developing ICT. This is not a particular problem in a globalised world in which the ways of doing things in Australia are not that different to how things are done in the US or in Europe. We can possibly rely on others to produce the technologies that we will need to drive a growing economy past the mining phase. What will be vital as a minimum, though, will be the ability and desire to utilise ICT to support innovation in everything else that we actually do. So even if being a primary provider of ICT is not in Australia’s future, being expert at using them will be. Toby Walsh, Research Leader at NICTA Paul Goyette/Flickr (cropped), CC BY-NC-SA ICT has been a great driver for change over the past 10 years – and, as illustrated by Brian’s examples above, it is sure to continue being one of the most important drivers over the next decade. So let’s not forget the immense environmental, societal as well as economic pressures that are building across the globe. Australia, the lucky country, has escaped many of the troubles so far, but our luck can only last so long, and ICT is one of the few hopes we have to mitigate the problems that lie ahead. We already work closely with our mathematician colleagues to develop equations to help government and business optimise their activities, and do more with less. It’s computers that ultimately solve these problems. As the recent debate over tax bills of multinationals demonstrate, nations must produce – not consume – intellectual property in the ICT space to reap the rewards. Take Google, for example. Google sits on around US$60 billion – not bad for a company founded on the back of a computer algorithm. But those rewards don’t go to the users of Google. They flow back to the producers. For this reason, Australia must produce ICT to ride the coming wave of change.

                                Drugs for psychiatric illnesses aren’t very effective. But new research is offering renewed hope for better medicines.

                                American wolves show us how important large predators are for conservation. Doug McLaughlin We know that introduced predators such as foxes and cats are one of the greatest threats to Australia’s wildlife, but what is the best way to control them? Many Australian ecologists argue dingoes are part of the solution, thanks to their ability to control numbers of feral predators. It’s a controversial idea, but one that receives support from new research on North American wolves. Through a project funded by the Australian-American Fulbright Commission, we’ve been doing research to better understand the role of dingoes in Australian ecosystems, by looking at wolves in North America. The results were published this week in the Journal of Animal Ecology. Why wolves? Wolves were virtually exterminated from the all the mainland United States (except Alaska) over the past two centuries, as part of predator control programs. But wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and surrounding areas in 1995-1996 under provisions of the US Endangered Species Act (which requires the restoration of endangered species that have been eliminated where possible). Coyote numbers increase when wolves disappear. Shawn McCready/Flickr, CC BY-ND Numerous studies of the Yellowstone wolves have shown that they quickly made an impact on the park ecosystem, mostly by reducing the numbers of their prey. But as wolves recolonise new areas of the United States we’re also interested in how wolves interact with other predators, in particular coyotes and red foxes. We hypothesised that wolves would reduce coyote numbers, because they are larger predators. But coyotes also reduce fox numbers, so we expected that wherever wolves are present there should be more foxes than coyotes. To explore these interactions, we analysed coyote and red fox fur trapping data across North America in areas with and without wolves. Who is the top dog? When wolves are around, there are plenty of foxes. Kelly Colgan Azar/Flickr, CC BY-ND In Alaska, Yukon and the NW Territories, wolves, coyotes and red foxes have co-existed since the early 1900s. We now know from the fur-trapping records that coyotes never outnumbered foxes in these areas where wolves also live. The records in areas without wolves tell a different story. As wolves were extirpated throughout much of the lower 48 United States, coyotes dramatically expanded their historical distribution. By the 1970s, coyotes dispersed from the middle of the United States all the way to Maine and New Brunswick and finally to Nova Scotia by the 1980s. Even though coyotes only recently colonised Maine, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the fur return data suggest that it only took 20-30 years for coyotes outnumber red foxes in the absence of wolves. Coyotes have spread across North America as wolves disappeared. Thomas Newsome These results support the hypothesis that wolves can have a strong impact on smaller predators down the food chain. The results also show when wolves were exterminated across much of the United States, it caused a continent wide shift in the balance between coyotes and red foxes. Saskatchewan and Manitoba show what happens when wolves and coyotes meet. Thomas Newsome We also wanted to know what happens when wolves and coyotes meet. To do this we analysed fur trapping records from Saskatchewan and Manitoba in central Canada. Wolves are found in both provinces, but are absent in the south. The provinces are therefore a perfect place to see how wolves interact with coyotes. In the south of the provinces where wolves are absent, the fur records indicate that coyotes outnumber red foxes on average by three to one, as we’d expect from our hypothesis. And where wolves are present, the balance dramatically favours red foxes on average by four to one and at an extreme of 500 to one at one site. However, in between is a 200 kilometre “transition zone” where too few wolves are present to tip the balance between coyotes and red foxes. Magic number of wolves If wolves reduce coyote numbers it may help a suite of species that are potentially threatened by coyotes such as pygmy rabbits and snowshoe hares. The expansion of wolves may also prove good for montane red foxes that have declined in the presence of coyotes. But the results in Canada demonstrate that wolves may need to spread over large ranges, and at high numbers, before they have a chance to control coyotes. This magic combination is known as an “ecologically effective density” of wolves, and prior to our study we knew very little about how many wolves are needed to control coyotes. What this means for Australian dingoes In Australia, dingoes often play the same “top dog” role as wolves in our ecosystems. And foxes, when dingoes disappear, often increase in the same way that coyotes do in the absence of wolves, with dire implications for our threatened native wildlife. But our study shows that top predators such as dingoes won’t be able to control lower order predators (such as foxes) if they are found in low numbers, and spread out over large areas. This presents a major dilemma, because humans have had a large impact on the distribution of dingoes, largely through exclusion fencing and pest management on farms where dingoes are synonymous with livestock predation. Dingoes also frequently come into conflict with people around some tourist and mining activities. The Australian dingo Thomas Newsome Is there a solution? We need a strategy that will help humans coexist with dingoes. This is challenging, particularly when dingoes pose a serious threat to human enterprises such as the livestock industry. The use of guardian animals to protect livestock is promising, but we still need to know whether this strategy can work over large spatial areas. Another possible option is to compensate farmers for stock-losses attributable to dingo attacks. This could be modelled on systems in the United States that provide compensation for wolf damage to reduce conflicts. But such schemes must include compensation for both direct (stock losses) and indirect (the effect of predation on the health of livestock) impacts, which are difficult to measure. At stake is the future of our ecosystems and biodiversity, which are being decimated by red foxes and feral cats. Also at stake is the future of Australia’s agriculture, particularly the sheep industry, which has long suffered from dingoes and red foxes. If dingoes continue to be controlled in the way they are now, we may never get a chance to see their true strength in controlling foxes and cats, and protecting Australia’s native wildlife.

Four days after CEO <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> offered most of his company’s patents to rivals in hopes of cultivating a bigger electric car market, Nissan and BMW are “keen on talks” to cooperate on charging networks, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

                                Ben Quilty, Captain S, after Afghanistan, 2012, oil on linen, 140 x 190cm. War art, like war, changes with time – but not as much as we might like to believe. So what is its function, and how has it evolved over time? Two current exhibitions – the travelling show Ben Quilty: After Afghanistan and Conflict: Contemporary responses to war at UQ Art Museum chart the shifting role of both official and non-official war art. Unlike the Vietnam era, the focus today is less on direct protest and resistance than it is on uncovering the complex legacies of war for contemporary society. On the eve of the centenary of the first world war (August 1) and in the wake of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, art continues to play a major role in understanding and remembering conflict. And at a time when discussion of commemoration in the Australian popular media is increasingly reductive and often jingoistic, the role of art is, if anything, more important than ever. The Australian War Memorial continues to manage the official war art scheme which involves an artist being embedded with Australian military forces in conflicts or peacekeeping missions for the purpose of creatively recording and interpreting the Australian experience of war. The war art scheme is now Australia’s longest running art commissioning program. It is also one of few such schemes to remain active anywhere in the world. Australia’s first war artist In May 1917, artist and political cartoonist Will Dyson was retrospectively appointed Australia’s first official war artist. Frustrated by Australia’s failure to emulate Canada’s official war art program (which commissioned a select group of artists to produce specific works during the first world war), he had volunteered to join the Australian Infantry Force as an artist and accepted an honorary position without pay. By the end of 1916 he was in France, where he witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting in history. Will Dyson, Dead beat, the tunnel, Hill 60, 1917, brush and ink, charcoal on paper, 50.2 x 44.8 cm. Australian War Memorial collection When Dyson’s grim but powerfully empathetic drawings of everyday life on the Western Front arrived back in London their significance was quickly understood. Despite this slow start, the official war art scheme quickly gained momentum and a total of 15 artists had been appointed by the end of the first world war. The scheme continued apace during the second world war (42 appointments), slowed in Korea (two appointments) and then faltered in Vietnam. While two artists went to Vietnam in 1967, the deep unpopularity of the war combined with the requirement for official artists to participate in active combat (for the only time in the scheme’s history) to make it very difficult, if not impossible, to identify willing participants. After lying dormant for more than 30 years, the scheme was reactivated in 1999, since which time 11 artists have been deployed to East Timor, the Solomon Islands, Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Australia. Ben Quilty: After Afghanistan In 2011 the Australian War Memorial appointed Australian artist Ben Quilty as the fourth and, as it turned out, final official war artist to Afghanistan. (He was preceded by Shaun Gladwell, Lyndell Brown, and Charles Green). Now on show in the travelling exhibition Ben Quilty: After Afghanistan, the paintings Quilty produced have much in common with Dyson’s work of a century earlier. Ben Quilty, Air Commodore John Oddie, after Afghanistan, 2012, oil on linen, 140 x 140 cm. Australian War Memorial collection Like Dyson, Quilty’s focus was neither major events nor heroic actions, but the experience of ordinary soldiers. And also like Dyson, Quilty’s deeply empathetic portraits emerged from the strong rapport he developed with the soldiers he met in the field. But while Dyson was concerned with the immediate experience of war, Quilty’s work focuses on its aftermath. Here his familiar thick, layered and partially abstracted paintings convey the psychological impact of conflict. These works provide rare insight into the personal cost of war for a general public increasingly removed from actual military experience. In doing so they have assumed a powerful social agency. Quilty’s commission has done much to shift post-traumatic stress disorder (a condition once rarely acknowledged) to the forefront of public discussion of war in Australia. Conflict: Contemporary responses to war Quilty’s work can also be seen alongside that of other official and non-official artists in Conflict: Contemporary responses to war, curated by Samantha Littley for the University of Queensland Art Museum. The first of several contemporary war art exhibitions slated for the next year, this large show surveys the diversity of recent responses to war. Shaun Gladwell, POV mirror sequence (Tarin Kowt) (digital still), 2009-10, 2 channel synchronised HD video, stereo audio, 16:9, 8 minutes 22 seconds. Australian War Memorial collection Notable shifts marked in this show include a strong rise in new media practices. Using film and animation respectively, Australian artists Shaun Gladwell and Baden Pailthorpe explore warfare in the digital age. In particular, they trace conflict’s immediate public dissemination and complex mediation by traditional, online, and social media. Both artists also point to the deep entanglement of military technologies with popular cultures (such as video games) and everyday life (such as the increasing civilian use of <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drones">drones</a></span>). The Conflict exhibition also includes the colonisation of Australia in its curatorial statement and features often sardonic work by Indigenous artists including Joan Ross, Daniel Boyd and Fiona Foley. The exhibition wades into a long contested debate currently being amplified by the forthcoming centenary of the first world war: acknowledgement of colonisation as warfare.

Also featured are a number of works that re-imagine the familiar form of the war memorial monument. (This is also the theme of another exhibition, Concrete, currently at the Monash University Museum of Art in Melbourne.) Melbourne-based artist Tom Nicholson’s Comparative monument (Palestine) (2012), is a proposal for a memorial to both the Australian Light Horse participation in the 1917 Battle of Beersheba, and the Palestinian exodus from the same city in 1948. Tom Nicholson, Comparative monument (Palestine), 2012, offset printed posters, dimensions variable, Australian War Memorial collection. Courtesy of the artist By remembering two very different but interwoven conflicts together, Nicholson highlights how the act of recalling one difficult history in the context of another can provide a platform for much-needed international unity into the future. At a time when so many of our public commentators seem content to rehearse tired polemic, we can look to our artists for the nuanced analysis the difficult history of war deserves. The next stop on the Ben Quilty: After Afghanistan tour is the John Curtin Gallery from August 2. Conflict: Contemporary responses to war shows at the UQ Art Museum until September 7. Ryan Johnston works for the Australian War Memorial which manages Australia's official war art scheme. The Memorial is also the organiser of the exhibition 'Ben Quilty: After Afghanistan'.

                                An anonymous reader writes in with news about proposed rules regarding mapping technology used in cars.Many are in favor of rules that prevent texting while driving, but in-car navigation is a murkier legal area — how do you minimize distractions without limiting the ability to get from point A to point B? Like it or not, the US government may settle that debate before long. The proposed Grow America Act would let the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) set rules for dash-mounted GPS units, smartphone mapping apps and anything else you'd use for driving directions. While it's not clear what the NHTSA would do with its power, the Department of Transportation's voluntary guidelines ask for limits on eye-catching visuals (think videos) and interaction times; don't be surprised if these enter the rulebooks. <span class='elision'>Read more of this story at Slashdot.</span>

                                Every once in a while a company comes along that completely changes the world. Google is one such company, making the Internet accessible and meaningful to billions of people. So is Facebook, which increasingly connects those billions of people. And then there's Apple, which has set the standard for what is possible with mobile devices. Still, it's too bad Apple can't be more like Tesla, the electric car company founded by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>. Because Tesla, unlike Apple, is determined to share its innovations. Opening Up Innovation Up until this past week, Tesla was much like Apple. It sought and hoarded patents, proudly displaying its patents on the wall of its Palo Alto headquarters. But last Thursday, Tesla made a bold move: it open sourced its patents. Every single one of them. The reason? As Musk opined on the company's blog, sharing innovation is better than stockpiling and suing over it: Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal. Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology. Nor is this some unselfish act whereby Musk plays the part of global benefactor to others' innovation at the expense of his balance sheet: At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla. We couldn’t have been more wrong. The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn’t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.... Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day. In other words, competitors haven't caught up. They're hardly in the game, and for Tesla to truly grow, it needs a vibrant, competitive market in which to build and sell its cars. A consumer that starts with a low-end competitor is more likely to then upgrade to Tesla's premium brand. Hence, as he stresses, the market would benefit, "from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform." As for concerns over losing Tesla's edge, Musk quashes that notion: Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers. We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard. It's a brilliant strategic move and it's one that would be unfathomable a few miles south in Apple's Cupertino. The Mobile Patent Quagmire Mobile computing has been a morass of patent suits and countersuits for years, nicely summarized by PC Mag's infographic. With so much money at stake, the reasoning goes, of course companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft would engage in IP jockeying to lock in their share. And, boy, have they ever. Apple, in particular, has been an active instigator of such suits, and has filed more than 350 cases with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office since January 2008. Steve Jobs was the heart and soul of Apple and he once famously accused Google of "grand theft" over Google's Android operating system and threatened that he was "willing to go to thermonuclear war on this." Which is exactly what we've seen. While Apple and Google's former manufacturing arm Motorola thawed the mobile patent warfare in March, agreeing to drop the suits they'd launched against each other, years were lost while Apple and its competitors fought each other in court.  Since the launch of the original iPhone, we've seen different screen sizes, more memory, faster chips and sharper resolution, all resulting in fat profits. But real, groundbreaking innovation equal to Apple's original touchscreen? Not so much. In fact, in 2013 reports surfaced that Apple's board was concerned by Apple's slowed pace of innovation.  There's a very valid argument that Apple doesn't need to constantly introduce new products, given how much it earns from existing products. Such earnings are fueled, in part, by the patent-encrusted moat Apple uses to defend its profits. No one can look at Apple's balance sheet and credibly call it a failure. Innovation Is The Best Protection Apple should not be lauded for resting on its patented laurels. As Musk noted last week, "If a company is truly relying on patents it means they aren't innovating, or not innovating fast enough. You want to be innovating so fast [that] you invalidate your prior patents."  Tesla is doing this. Apple could, too. Apple regularly wows the world with beautiful, brilliant products. Imagine the innovation we might have seen these past few years if Apple were forcing itself and the entire industry to look forward to new developments rather than constantly cashing in on old achievements. It could be advancing the mobile industry far faster while still plumping its bank balance if it, too, opened up its innovations as Tesla has done. Tesla's decision to open its patents isn't dissimilar from what the open-source software world does. Years ago Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst pointed out that open source business models align customer and vendor interests by forcing vendors to "innovate or die." In the open-source world, customers only pay for subscriptions when software is constantly being improved. They only pay when their vendors deliver real value. That may be a scary proposition for Apple, but given its culture of innovation, it is one Cupertino should welcome.

                                The news: After much speculation, Tesla Motors CEO <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span> announced on Thursday that he is not just giving away the company's proprietary Supercharger technology — he is giving away every Tesla patent. That's right: The head of a major car company just said they are going fully open-source. In one single seismic quote, Musk said patents "serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors." While Tesla will still legally hold its patents, it will no longer sue other car makers who are using the technology in good faith. "If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal," Musk wrote on the company website.

                                THE author of “Fifty Shades of Grey”, E.L. James, has mused at length about a billionaire inflicting punishment in her bondage-based bestseller. As the recipient of one of the first right-hand-drive versions of the Tesla Model S to hit Britain’s roads, personally handed to her at an event in London last week by <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a></span>, the carmaker’s wealthy boss, she is clearly attuned to billionaires dishing out pleasure too. The “range anxiety” that afflicts other electric-car owners has been minimised in the Model S by packing it with lots of batteries; the agony-inducing cost of filling up at the petrol station need never bother Ms James again.Other all-electric cars, costly and with limited ranges, have proved a hard sell. The models from most mainstream carmakers still look and feel like gimmicks. Tesla’s main achievement is producing a car which can be judged credibly alongside any fast and expensive petrol-propelled saloon. But the Californian company’s long-term growth prospects, and the widespread adoption of electric cars, are both dependent on a big drop in battery costs. Tesla’s next mission, to begin making a cheaper, mass-market electric vehicle...

                                MEDIOBANCA was founded in 1946 with an explicit mission to rebuild Italian industry in the aftermath of the second world war. The result was a web of cross-shareholdings and pacts among big shareholders, with the Milanese investment bank at its centre, which allowed a narrow elite to control many of the country’s biggest businesses for decades. So the announcement last year that Mediobanca would exit these pacts and focus on its core business constituted a dramatic reversal. What with a similar move by Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer, the web is beginning to look a little tattered (see chart).Mediobanca has sold €800m ($1.1 billion) of equities over the past nine months, half of its three-year goal. Both it and Generali say they will exit the pact that controls Telecom Italia this month, and eventually sell their shares. Privatisation is also changing things. The government is selling part of Fincantieri, one of Europe’s biggest shipbuilders, this month; Poste Italiane, the postal service, will probably be next. Many privately held firms plan offerings too, led by Cerved, a <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>-services company.

                                In December, India's Supreme Court overturned a lower court's previous decision that had decriminalized homosexuality. The top court's ruling declared same-sex intercourse and marriage illegal again, ending a four-year period of gay freedom.  At the time, human rights groups issued statements quibbling with the ruling. The Lawyers Collective, the legal group that advanced the case, called it "a major setback to LGBT rights," while Anjali Gopalan of the <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV">HIV</a></span>/<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AIDS">AIDS</a></span>-focused Naz Foundation called it "a black day," adding, "We are being set back by 100 years."

                                EXUBERANCE about both “<span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big data">big data</a></span>” and Twitter has of late given way to a degree of scepticism among commentators. Yet Dataminr, a New York startup that analyses the 500m or so tweets sent out daily, goes from strength to strength. Founded in 2009 to scour the Twittersphere for important events and news not yet reported by the mainstream media, the firm now has dozens of customers in finance, the news business and the public sector. In January it and Twitter struck a deal to provide alerts to CNN. In April its tracking of tweets was part of a strategy by the authorities in Boston to avoid a repeat of last year’s terrorist attack at the city’s annual marathon.Dataminr scores every tweet using about 30 indicators of significance, says Ted Bailey, who launched the firm with two former Yale roommates. Dataminr started out seeking market-sensitive information for investors. It now supplies around 50 financial firms. Then came various arms of government; Mr Bailey claims ten clients, though he will name only the city of Boston.Sorting out the signal from the Twitter noise is not easy. How to tell which tweeters are on to something, and which are just twits? Is there a clue in their language, or their location? Can a false positive be spotted fast enough?Much of Dataminr’s early work involved tracing back stories that proved genuine, and market-moving events, to find their earliest...

                                TED | Two hundred million years ago, our mammal ancestors developed a new brain feature: the neocortex. This stamp-sized piece of tissue, wrapped around a brain the size of a walnut, is the key to what humanity has become. Now, futurist <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ray Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a></span> suggests, we should get ready for the next big leap in brain power, [...]

                                ON MAY 1st 2007 John Browne resigned as boss of BP, a British oil giant, his career apparently in ruins. A tabloid newspaper had exposed his affair with a male ex-prostitute. For the next few weeks Lord Browne was subjected to one of those trials by media at which the British excel. Three years later the Deepwater Horizon disaster, an explosion that led to the leakage of millions of gallons of oil off America’s Gulf coast, suggested that there might have been more serious reasons than his private sexual preferences to question Lord Browne’s tenure at BP. The disaster seemed to confirm both the worries of some analysts that he had sacrificed investment in a dash for growth, and environmentalists’ accusations that his rebranding of BP as Beyond Petroleum was just superficial “greenwashing”.Despite all the blows to his reputation, Lord Browne has done a remarkable job of reviving his career. He has built Riverstone Holdings, a private-equity company, into a powerful force in European <span class='hilite'><a class="act" target="_blank "  title="Opens new tab" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fracking">fracking</a></span>.
